HephaestusHarper	Left a bad taste in my mouth...	24	0	"So I'm listening to the back catalogue of the show and was caught off-guard by the Esther Hollis ""April Fool's"" episode this morning. I don't typically check the airdate for old episodes and I'm not a Taylor Swift fan so I assumed it was just another ordinary episode. And then they started laughing at the end. The whole thing just felt really distasteful and inappropriate to me, and like it diminished the tragedy of other similar cases. Like, if they were ~inspired~ by the song, do an episode about no-body cases and the legal hurdles therein. (Or if you must do this, state upfront it's a work of fiction.) It seemed like they were willing to use a story of domestic violence and corruption to get senpai to notice them when versions of that story are happening to real people in the real world. I think I'm done with the show."	20211013T163413

No-Technology-7718	Crime Junkie and Trace Evidence Episode Overlap	26	0	"Trace Evidence (TE) posted a tweet on 2/21/2021 where he states that Crime Junkie (CJ) has overlapped his episodes ""31 times now, resulting in 22% of my \[his\] 146 episodes having been done later by CJ."" That got me thinking and I wanted to compare the episode lists of the two podcasts. My images and tables ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF PLAGIARISM. I have not compared the content within these episodes, just that they cover the same victims and cases. However, if any of you want to listen to these side by side I would love to hear your thoughts. What I did find was that from 2017 - 2020 CJ covered 17 cases that were previously done by TE. Many of these were the earliest episodes of Trace Evidence. In reverse, TE has done 3 episodes with topics and victims that had been discussed on Crime Junkie before the TE episodes were released. Does this all mean anything? Not on its own, but I thought it was interesting to look at their episode lists side by side. \*A note about these findings - I could have missed cases that overlapped and if any of you notice please let me know and I will update my data. https://preview.redd.it/pqe7tlvjsbs71.png?width=2018&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=741fb8f93cafe38b4c9feff985425cfc6d1ccdd9 https://preview.redd.it/nuus7ovjsbs71.png?width=1676&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01a06180a594e2940992e48ba5049604283773ae https://preview.redd.it/j6prervjsbs71.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b6b6d7224d4d1096aaaa0e8cde9ff07aec9a334f https://preview.redd.it/dnnrkqvjsbs71.png?width=1675&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6df8a4d640095ad83ecfa595e30e1de712d99f37 https://preview.redd.it/urwwtrvjsbs71.png?width=1676&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5d85fe3a3acb0aa0114240f82cd4b2816d7dde73"	20211009T011513

jubilantpeach	Hendricks family episode left a bad taste in my mouth	115	0	This is my first post on Reddit, so I hope I am doing everything correctly. Content warning for discussion of sexual harassment. I normally listen to crime junkie because they highlight lesser-known cases and try to give exposure, but this weeks episode left me feeling really disappointed in the lack of sensitivity. First, I totally can understand their stance that the man at the center of the case is innocent. And I can understand they were trying to make points surrounding this. However, when they talked about “escalating” inappropriate moves on young women and inappropriate conduct, I was really taken aback. There is not a “trauma hierarchy”—inappropriate touching (grazing of a breast, being asked to wear a leotard, etc.) is ALL inappropriate and should be treated as such. I felt like they were trying to “rank” sexual misconduct which can be harmful for survivors. Especially when they said the timeline was out of order—ok and?? Inappropriate touching or behavior is just that—inappropriate. Secondly, I was really frustrated when Ashley said he “accidentally grazed someone’s boob, or whatever, maybe did it on purpose I don’t know.” It left me feeling sad for the person who has to share that story in court, and may have felt embarrassment or shame doing so. It made me feel sad that not only did she have to experience it in the first place, but now was being doubted and told it was an accident by a podcaster with a huge following and a lot of power. It also goes against EVERYTHING we know about responding to sexual harassment & assault, and even things CJ said previously (such as believing victims/survivors). I came to this sub to hear others thoughts on it. I work in a field where I work with many people who experience sexual trauma so I may be reading into it, but it left me feeling sad and discouraged from continuing to listen to them.	20211007T011406

RyLoRyLo	Crime Junkie > Morbid	73	0	I’ve never heard of the Morbid podcast until I joined this community. I saw that it is mentioned here a lot so I decided to give it a listen. I can see why these two podcasts are always compared. I’ve only listened to one episode of Morbid so far but I’m curious as to what people think of the hosts. My initial feeling is that the two hosts are hard to listen to. They talk over each other a lot and constantly laugh or make light of the tragic situation. They also have way too many sidebars. To be fair, I can’t stand Britt’s over the top gasps and Ashley’s fake crying either but their storytelling is much better and easier to follow. Curious about other people’s thoughts who listen to both.	20211006T103238

anonymous	I’m not trying to be picky but…	25	0	Was it just me, or was this week’s episode just not it (Hendricks family)? I was a little thrown off first by the full minute of ads at the beginning and then again when they did the re-enactment of the 911 calls. To me, the re-enactment felt like “filler” content, along with some of the times where Brit is called in to read a quote or a paragraph or something…I don’t know, i feel like it disrupts the flow to have Ashley stop for Brit- I feel like she should just read it herself. I WILL say that I liked the whole part at the beginning about the Season of Justice and I do like how Brit has her own organic interjections, like when she described the models used as witnesses for the trial and used her color gradient example. I guess I prefer her to make her own contributions rather than being thrown in to give a description of a police sketch or read a random quote as her way to “add” to the episode. Anyway! Not trying to be super critical, I was just wondering if anyone else felt like some parts of the episode felt a bit off this week.	20211004T081806

JarlShitpost	Full Body Chills Trigger Warnings	0	0	New episodes of Ashley's fictional horror podcast Full Body Chills came out today, and they still aren't using any kind of trigger warnings even though they got pretty gruesome last year. I'm compiling a list below as I listen (edit- all done!)- please add on if you've listened. Trying not to include spoilers, but I'm using spoiler tags just in case. If you think this is silly, or if you don't get why someone who isn't prepared for the worst would listen to a horror podcast, that's totally cool! You're not the target audience of this post, but I can see where you're coming from. If you like horror but are sensitive to topics like gore or abuse, I hope this post helps you decide whether to skip an episode. Family Matters - >!Violence, torture!< Not So Alone At The Farm - None really, but maybe discussions of >!home invasion!<? Slither - >!Vivid imagery about death/dead body, parasitic worms, tryptophobia, body horror!< Room For Rent - >!murder!<, huge spoiler but I don't know what else to call this: >!taxidermy on living people!< Vinyl Words - This was released last year, don't know why they re-released it. Anyway: >!self mutilation, accidental suicide/death!< The Story of Vera Valentine - None The Jumps - >!brief mention of abuse by a parent (sexual abuse implied)!<, big spoiler but there is also >!accidental death!< The Urology King of Brighton Beach - Much more mild than the title would lead you to believe. >!Mention of cancer, murder!< The Snake - This one was really hard to listen to imo: >!child murder, eye horror, graphic descriptions of murder, brutal and graphic suicide, serial killer, hearing voices and delusions, internal parasitic worm/snake!<	20211001T120750

hammocknap5	A lesser-discussed detail of Brittanee Drexel case / episode	8	0	"Does anybody else find it a bit strange that, if the podcast is accurate, BD's boyfriend (John) called her mom in a ""panic"" after only *over 1 hour* passed since he last heard from BD. I've read other internet comments saying he knew Peter. No idea if true, but they were from the same town. I am NOT saying John had anything to do with with the (likely) murder. He absolutely did not. But, under any regular circumstances, most people would certainly not spill the beans on a girlfriend to her parents about her totally disobeying them in a major way after only *one hour* of failed contact. It makes me think either A- John was contacted by Peter/the guys she was with (under the assumption he did indeed know any of them), who were currently fleeing the state btw, and the information he heard was very concerning... or B- John was skeptical about *something* in the first place regarding everybody down there (those guys and Brittannee's ""friends"")."	20210928T203839

And I would be fine if the app wasn’t terrible. It’s a fine idea, but it crashes, without fail, every 3-4 minutes. It's unusable. It also makes my other apps run slower or glitch, which has never happened before. I don't understand how it has such a high rating on the App Store—I’m guessing bots.

kateweathermachine	Any way to suggest cases?	36	0	In 2014 Tucker Hipps, a 19-year-old college student at Clemson and pledge in Sigma Phi Epsilon didn’t return from a “pledge run” and his body was found in the lake near campus. His frat allegedly held an emergency meeting between his time of death and when the frat reported him missing. No one was arrested in his case and a few days ago the reward for information was bumped up to $75,000 (from $50,000). This fall at the same school, Kappa Alpha allegedly poured peanut oil on a pledge who was allergic to peanuts. No one controls them bc anytime Greek life gets in trouble, donors threaten to pull funding. The case has resurfaced a bit because of the peanut oil incident, like everyone knows the frat was involved and everyone knows nothing has changed. More eyes on the case would really help since everyone who was there has graduated at this point…I was wondering if there’s any way to suggest cases to the podcast? The people responsible should be held accountable for what happened to him	20210926T034056

I had a six hour drive one day and listened the whole time. Two years later, I try listening and I can't get through an episode. Glad I found this place because I've been pissed about their horrible theme music they play every damn week.

Lizard_Mage	Gabby Petito, Missing White Woman Syndrome, And What We Can Do	8	0	"Hi all! I'm a CJ listener, and a regular consumer of true crime media. So of course, I've been following the Gabby Petito case. (May she rest in peace, and may her family receive answers and justice) In following the case, I've also noticed a lot of discussions about ""Missing White Woman Syndrome"" and the fact that there are hundreds of women of color who have gone missing and then rarely get the media coverage that white women get. Obviously, this is a serious injustice. And I think, as a consumer of true crime media, it's important for us to acknowledge and push for change in the ways that we can. Do you guys have any suggestions for shows, documentaries, podcasts, blogs, YouTube channels, and other media that do delve deeper into these lesser known missing persons' cases? Especially content creators part of those undercovered/underrepresented communities! I want to give them more clicks and listens. I don't have a lot of money (student life...), but I can at least support those media outlets in small ways. Thanks ahead of time <3"	20210923T193936

Married2therebellion	Yay a fresh wave of CJ hate.	47	0	I’m so confused with all these hate posts/comments. I still don’t think I understand. If so many people hate the podcast, why listen and follow them on all socials only to complain about anything they do? The backlash Crime Junkies is getting for making an episode is strangely confusing coming from a community built on getting “enjoyment” from ppls death. Tbh CJ is the only podcast that took the opportunity to cover Gabby (who was missing not dead at the time of the episode) and still shed some light on a missing POC. Like oh wow, They are sensationalizing someone’s “death”…. which is somehow different from all the actual deaths they’ve built their podcast on. And all the other deaths the entire true crime industry is built on. And the true crime deaths Gabby herself listened to. Omg Crime Junkie is the worst for sensationalizing this. Because the news stations haven’t sensationalized the case. Because other podcasts haven’t followed covered it. Anyways Jelani Day, Lauren Cho, Phoenix Coldon and many other Black/POC are still missing and wish they got as much attention Gabby got. Their families wish they could get so much attention, people are upset at their cases getting too much attention from podcasts.	20210922T015230

taydaerey	Snarky comments	45	0	I’m listening to the most recent episode and very put off by Britt’s snarky comments when bystanders come forward to share any details they have. There’s one about a person who came forward to share that the victim was wear jeans that she brushed off and later another where she states “well he got a fun little road trip out of it”. To me this downplays the information that police could have learned from those potential witnesses and may keep people from coming forward in the future if they don’t feel like they have enough details. It just really rubbed me the wrong way and I wish they would be more careful about these sorts of statements.	20210914T172023
Misswow33	Mary Badaracco - Re-activated my reddit account to vent about this episode. Couldn't find a thread already made for it. How could the police have just looked over literally EVERYTHING important about this case, it's horrifying!!!!!!	20	0	"It's so scary that this guy literally gets away with murder. Overlooking 1 red flag is one thing, but overlooking as many as they did?! No money trail.... broken car window (I'm sure she just walked on foot when she ran away!!), history of violence/abuse, mom doesn't contact kids, moving ""tenants"" AKA lady you're having affair with days after (then getting married, couldn't have seen that coming HMMMMM).... It is just BEYOND me that one of these red flags on it's own is already enough... but all of them together?? completely undeniable. And the fact that OK maybe 1 police officer is somehow not seeing it but the entire force?! I am so extremely bothered by this entire case and feel so so awful for the daughters. RIP Mary."	20210914T162124

Educational_Word_164	Question in regards to misinformation	0	0	Throwaway for an obvious reason: Huge fan of this podcast and supernatural; however, with current trends in what is considered “misinformation”, wouldn’t some episodes of crime junkie and most of supernatural be considered misinformation, and how do you rectify it if you believe in censoring misinformation? A person who wanted to argue these podcasts are harmful misinformation could state there is potential harm in pushing governmental conspiracy theories (supernatural) or pushing suspects into a negative light that haven’t had or had their day in court. Interested to see how everyone here who cares about misinformation justifies what some may consider misinformation in the podcasts series	20210906T232131

hey_itsmak	This podcast just isn’t about education in true crime anymore.	102	0	Is it just me, or does the flow of the podcast seem stiff and unnatural now? It feels absolutely scripted. It’s been bugging me for a while and I just placed it. They started with a great flow and back-and-forth; but now, Brit interrupts right as the momentum is actually rolling, the story feels more like a school lesson than to educate, Brit’s reactions are annoyingly over the top, they dwell on random details and get judge-y over them, etc. Yes, Brit, we know you wouldn’t let your kids do that. But it doesn’t matter because that’s not what happened. Yes, that’s cool you two did XYZ as kids/in high school, but that’s not what happened here, so please tell the story. Additionally, it feels consistently sexist. I’m not sure they’ve ever covered a woman serial killer or kidnapper. The few cases of female killers they do cover are females who killed their families or loved ones, and they’re always given sympathy. It’s been driving me crazy. I used to love listening to the podcast, but it feels awkward, preachy, and just not genuine anymore.	20210906T065900

But the last couple of episodes I've listened to I've gotten so annoyed by the amount of activism they're pushing towards the audience. Don't get me wrong I think it's great to care about these things and wanting to make a difference but especially in the Kaysera episode I felt like it was pushed so far down my throat and in the face of the audience that I was off put. Idk could just be me. Anyone else feel this way?	20210904T202245
n0vaturient	I can't stand the unnecessary commentary by the hosts anymore	60	0	Maybe I'm being nitpicky here but the hosts ( especially Brit) are starting to get more annoying with each episode.

I get that it's always been the style of the podcast but somehow I'm starting to get really bothered by it.	20210904T151638

laceleah	Ryan Shtuka case	22	0	So I just listened to the newest podcast, the disappearance of Ryan Shtuka. In the podcast, they claim dogs were brought into the party house but never picked up his scent. I’m totally thinking he never even went & it’s a huge cover up! Surely if he was there AT ALL, then one of the five dogs would have caught his scent anywhere in the house?? (Also can’t find an article where they say dogs didn’t find his scent, but I didn’t do a ton of digging.) couldn’t his “friends” be covering up something that happened BEFORE all of the drinking & partying took place?	20210831T054448
cmykvsrgbvsbw	The most recent episode has groomers upset	3	0	I’m a dog groomer, in Indianapolis. Hearing Ashley make the remarks she did on the last episode felt like a personal attack, I know groomers who have worked with her dog Chuck as well as the person who currently grooms the dog she mentioned being injured. I know where the incident happened, I was able to accurately guess it just by the area she mentioned before confirming it. I am not a fan of the owners of that shop, I’ve heard stories of how they handle things like this both from staff and clients. I know that not all groomers have the same values and ethics that I do, but many share my opinions. Even if I were just going off what Ashley said, I would agree that that’s not a place you want to patronize. I believe groomers are responsible to cover vet fees if they injure an animal this way, accidents happen and that needs to be planned for. They DO need to be held accountable. Our industry is pretty tight knit, we have tons of Facebook groups that help us network and support each other. A huge amount of us listen to this podcast while we are working, and the discussions happening about this right now that I am witnessing have a large amount of disappointed and hurt fans. To us is came across as an uneducated and thoughtless attack on an industry we are fiercely passionate about. While I agree that the business in question did not handle the incident correctly, I disagree with her choice to speak so flippantly about my community.	20210830T215624

opossumbility	Looking for the name of a couple of episodes!	1	0	I have a horrible habit of only half-listening to podcasts (often because I listen to them while cleaning or working) but there's a couple episodes I want to go back and listen to, but I can only remember a few key details! Maybe you can help?? The first one was a girl whose body was never found, but one of the killers confessed and said they disposed of the body in a cave that no one could get to. I want to say there were multiple killers on this one, but I could be mistaken! The second was a man who had met a woman online and was going to meet her in real life, but his best friend got some weird emails from him and it turns out the woman was actually a man who killed the friend. I remember the killer had this like mask and screenplay where he basically described the murder? Does any of this ring a bell?? If you can drop some episode names, I would SO appreciate it!	20210821T180031

sallytm	“And I’m Brit...”	110	0	Currently on a road trip with my girlfriend and while it was her turn to drive, she suggested we play some CJP. We just listened to a few episodes and I haven’t been this annoyed in a while. On the Cleveland Strangler episode towards the end, Ashley says something along the lines of “..since I started working on this case.” My gf and I looked at each other in confusion. Is she being for real?? “Working” this case?? What?? Did she contribute to catching the guy or saving any of those women?? Am I missing something? My gf made a good point and said that it’s sort of disrespectful to people who *actually* worked on this case. She probably used Google and the articles/work of others to make the episode. Something else that’s been driving me crazy is their attempt to be relatable to the stories they tell while laughing; mostly Brit. On the Kendrick Johnson episode, they were talking about how the kid was stuck in the mats at his high school gym and playing with the possibility that it may have been an accident of his. Brit made the *disgusting* comment that she’d rather “die” that to be caught or be embarrassed in a similar situation (or something like that). All while laughing. I remember listening to the end of an episode a while back while on another long drive with my gf and they did a little segment about a person who wrote in about their dog. From what I remember, it was a sad story truthfully, but I specifically remember Ashley and Brit sobbing like little babies. I understand that everyone has different ways of dealing with emotional situations, but why not at least show some of these victims and families of victims a little decency and respect by not laughing just to be relatable?? Sorry for ranting for those of you who got this far, but I think I’m done with this podcast. No matter what episode it is, I find myself frustrated in some way or another and cringing listening to these ladies. My gf wants to add a little rant herself: Brit’s role in the podcast is totally and utterly useless. She said that she doesn’t add anything to the episodes and if you were to edit her parts out, you wouldn’t miss out on any content or important details; the podcast would actually be less annoying. I couldn’t agree more.	20210818T171045

paulnewman_aridehome	Misplaced blame?	0	0	Just listened to The Cleveland Strangler episode. And I feel like there was an inordinate amount of time (nearly 15 minutes) spent blaming the police for these crimes- INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL MURDERER. They literally spent time explaining why the smell wasn’t attributed to his house. But then still blamed the police for not identifying the smell. They kept saying that the police should have known because he was a registered sex offender and they had regular visits. But then go on to say that the bodies were BURIED in the house and yard. Do we expect the police to dig up a yard? Or under the stairs? The parts where the police didn’t investigate the statements of witnesses is 100% the fault of the police. (And even some of those are questionable— like the woman who lied to police about the story— they were supposed to question the story of the victim??) But not the other things. It just felt like the blame was very misplaced. EDIT: typo	20210807T143947
swisscheesebae	80's / 90's Mysteries	21	0	I have been a true crime junkie for a long time now. Recently I realised that mysteries from the 80's and 90's intrigue me so much more than contemporary ones. It might be because of the lack of any digital evidence that gives the mysteries a more intense - 'hard to solve' vibe. But I'm not exactly sure. I tend to check the timeline before I start listening to any pods to see if the mystery is from that era. Does anyone else relate to this? This is a very specific interest area, I know. But it'd be weirdly comforting if anyone else had the same interests lol. Any suggestions for such episodes are welcome - kindly leave them in the comments.	20210806T194202

astewes	How CJ Can Get Its Mojo Back	58	0	I first discovered CJ in January 2020 and quickly found myself binging all the episodes. It’s been a primary source of entertainment (and distraction) for me throughout the pandemic, which I’m very grateful for. But lately, I’ve seen a number of threads about CJ losing its mojo. And as much as it hurts me to say this, I’m starting to agree with these sentiments. On that note, here are some of my primary gripes, intermixed with some suggestions for how to course correct: * Is it just me, or has the writing gone downhill? Newer episodes (I'd place this around Q4 2020) feel rushed and fluffy––ie, a lack of thorough research; too many stale one-liners (full body chills, you guys!). Maybe it’s the writing, or maybe it’s the cases they’re selecting, but over the past few weeks alone I’ve found myself bored and wanting to tune out. It’s time to switch up the formula. * More and more, new episodes are really nothing more than plugs for other audiochuck shows coming down the pipeline. It reminds me of an article from a few years ago in which Ashley said they were on track to building a “seven-figure business,” which really says a lot, don’t you think? To be clear: I don’t think there’s anything wrong with growing the business or trying to generate more profits. My issue is that they seem hyper-focused on commercialization, which cheapens the show. Rather than making it all about expanding the audiochuck empire, why not ink a deal with HBO, Netflix, or another streaming platform for a TV adaptation of CJ that would basically be the same thing, but from the angle of Ashley & Brit in the recording studio––similar to what’s been done with Pod Save America and other hit podcasts. Just a thought. My point being: there are ways to make more money while also keeping the focus on CJ itself, and even expanding its reach through other entertainment mediums. * Ashley spends an inordinate amount of time talking about activism. Don’t get me wrong: I care about activism! Activism GOOD! Listeners should feel compelled to take action––ie, donating to Crime Stoppers, signing petitions––but not at the expense of the actual storytelling, which is what made CJ so resonant in the first place. Can’t there be a balance? * Headlines episodes have gotten consistently shorter in length––they used to be about 90 minutes long, but are now closer to 45 minutes. They're beginning to feel like an afterthought. I realize that episode length largely depends on the number of headlines there are to discuss for a given month, but couldn’t there just be more time spent diving into each case? IMHO, these unscripted discussions are when Ashley & Brit are at their best, and it’s one of the main reasons I upgraded to the $20 tier.	20210729T225515

ZucchiniVegetable	Is Solvable even worth listening to?	23	0	Despite all of Ashley's dramatics and the scandals, I still enjoy Audiochuck's shows and follow all of them. However, I am only an episode and a half in and maybe it's just me but the quality just seems to be lacking. Here are some things I've noticed so far: 1. **This absolutely did not have to be a 10 part series.** Each episode is less than 30 mins long and some barely break 20 mins. Factoring how much time is spent on ad reads, that is not a lot of content. I get spreading it across 10 episodes allows you to put more ads in but there is not a good balance from what I've seen so far. With the episodes being so short it literally feels like half the episode is just ads. 2. **The hosts are not intriguing**. They both have a serious case of monotone and I find myself not being able to pay attention. They are not dynamic like Catherine or Delia. And say what you want about Ashely being dramatic-- at least the way she speaks is intriguing and really invites the listener in imo. 3. **The** [website](https://solvablepodcast.com/) **is poorly managed**. There are no sources listed for some of the episodes, the photos don't let you zoom in, and the worst offense imo is in episode 2, the hosts specifically mention having a particular picture up on their website and they just... don't. It is so bare-bones you would think this is Audiochuck's first project on not one of many that they've done. Overall this is a shame because the case really does sound interesting. If it gets better after episode 2, let me know! If it doesn't, then thanks for saving my time. I'm also interested in hearing everyone else's thoughts on this podcast.	20210725T195548

Final_Individual	CJ Cases that have TV episodes or documentaries	16	0	I’ve started loving to find documentaries and single TV episodes on cases I’ve heard on Crime Junkie or read about Reddit. It really helps to bring the story to life and it’s almost like hearing the case for the first time. The Crime Door app has been super helpful for finding them (just search the name and find all the digital pieces available on the case). I’ve realized most of it is on Hulu, which is why I continue to pay $60 (I think) per month to keep it. I’ve found some cases on Dateline or Unsolved Mysteries, but Hulu also has a lot of lesser known shows. Does anybody know any specific documentaries that CJ has done an episode on? Or even lesser known cases that have episodes or documentaries about them that you’d recommend? Thanks in advance!	20210720T221348

IkeaYayas	Podcast recommendation: Murder With my Husband	107	0	Hi Junkies! If you’re like me and A) love true crime and 2) get slightly annoyed at how scripted CJ can be I’d like to recommend a show. Murder with My Husband. A true crime loving wife tells stories to her true crime hating husband. He has never heard any of the stories she tells until they hit record. So his reactions and their discussion is 100% authentic. They also tell a lot of stories I haven’t heard on other podcasts and focus on the victim never that attacker. If you want to check it it out I’d suggest giving episode 4. Real Life Mean Girls or 17. Fight Like Girls a listen!	20210712T233833

Blonde-the-impaler	Lets talk about interantional infamy	46	0	This afternoon I decided to see which cases Ashley is doing in her new podcast 'International Infamy...'. The latest episode (episode 4) is the same case catherine townsend covers in her episode four of Red Collar. This to me just feels wrong. I understand there is a Ton of rehashing of cases throughout the podcast and documentary universe, however Ashley is a producer and the CEO of audiochuck. so my thought are she's farming content from her own production company for content for her new paracast (spotify owned) production. This Just irks me. I try to tell myself perhaps she's covering it from a different angle so I listen to it... low behold it is legit an abridged version of Catherines reporting. As the CEO of Audiochuck I feel she owes her podcasters the dignity of protecting and supporting their research aand storytelling, it seems evident that is not the case. I don't know. I've stayed away from the CJ plagerism debacle... Alas, now this taste in my mouth is too bitter to ignore. So much for Woman supporting woman, sorry Ashley Flowers We done	20210709T195224

FelonysAlibi	Question about sources	8	0	New listener, I’ve only heard about a dozen or so episodes. It seems as though all their sources are articles in newspapers/magazines.

I’m just curious because I read a lot, so I already knew the stuff they cited. I want to hear new info, I’m wondering if CJ might not be for me.	20210706T194815
nappingpeasant	I’m beginning to hate CJ….	161	0	I’ve been a long time listener of crime junkies and used to love the show. Now, I literally almost can’t stand it. CJ was the first true crime podcast I came across and I couldn’t get enough. Since becoming familiar with a variety of true crime pods, CJ ranks very low on my list. Nowadays, Ashley Flowers and Brit seem like they put in next to no effort into the show. I feel their investigative work into the cases is very surface level and the whole thing is incredibly scripted. I used to read about people getting annoyed with brits useless comments but her comments never bothered me. Now, they drive me INSANE!! Is anyone else feeling this way, or am I just being a hater?	20210706T181347

It seems that Ashley is pretty quick to pull the “systemic racism” trigger whenever a person of color’s disappearance or death doesn’t seem properly investigated. I’m not disagreeing that it is present, see the Kaysera Tops corner use of “exposure,” but it has been bothering me that she doesn’t really bring up any evidence of racism vs sloppy police work. I was blissfully ignorant about CJ before finding this sub but since the plagiarism, Ashley’s crying, and Britt acting extra getting pointed out to me when I listed to new episodes I am finding things that bother me.	20210705T192601

PresentLink2799	What I want for Crime Junkie.	34	0	Have you ever tried to go to sleep but you have a random thought in your head and need to get it off your chest? I suppose that's the very reason for Reddit. I've posted twice (and now three times) in this group and I've been thinking a lot about the responses I've been getting to those posts. And I do kind of agree with the thought that if you can't stand a critique of Crime Junkie, than the way forward is not to try to stop critiques but maybe find alternative forums. I stand with my critiques of Crime Junkie. I'm a little disappointed in myself that I did not give the plagiarism scandal the full attention that I think it deserves. I didn't put it together until I heard it explained by other podcasters. I am now in a space where I am wondering where does Ashley Flowers's talent start and where did the plagiarism end. Opinions. Galore. Exist. I know. Everyone will make up their own mind. I also stand with my critiques of their recent shows. I did love the show in the beginning and I do think it's lost it's way to some degree. I can't speak for everyone in this group, **but I don't think you're evil if you enjoy Crime Junkie and want to continue listening, despite the plagiarism.** Not like you need my fucking validation, but I think when there are lines drawn, people should lean into empathy. I've read a lot of comments from people that have a defensive tone that I think is unnecessary. Life is hard, and we all need reprieves, and the way that CJ tells some stories is intriguing. It ignites the senses. And so if you listen to because you just want to, no one is gonna stop you. And if you wish that this Reddit had more content directly related to cases, seriously, as a former patreon member, their patreon is FILLED with comments on cases. I think that would be a great place to find community. I could see a world in which many just want to talk about the cases which is what I think true crime is for so many. It's interesting, investigative, it can challenge the brain, etc. I think what a lot of people are looking for as they continue to bring up the plagiarism is just....something more than what we were given. My mouth is no longer on the floor, but truly, I did not realize how egregious their theft was and it does feel astonishing that they are unscathed. It's disappointing, especially when I regarded Brit and Ashley as women of high morals. And maybe it wasn't directly them, but I think the point is that this scenario feels unsatisfying. And so, if you're annoyed by continuously bringing up the plagarism, I'd urge you to think about a time when you felt like someone got away with something, and how that made you feel. For some people, this is going to be stuck in their crawl for awhile. Let them express it. People may disagree but what I want for Crime Junkie is not their ending. I think they have to change some behaviors and make more amends. They have done some serious damage, and as a large monolith, they're immune. I just want better from them because this is like watching the popular girls kick the asses of people who are just trying to do their jobs with integrity, and it's kind of fucking hard to take lying down. I really liked them and I hope one day to like them again.	20210702T034202
roweaboat	Is there a Red Collar sub?	15	0	I know this isn't technically Crime Junkie, but I was wondering if anyone here knows if there is a Red Collar subreddit. Would love to talk about some of those cases. It is an Audio Chuck podcast which is why I'm asking this here. I would also recommend this podcast to anyone who is annoyed with CJ. Catherine Townsend is a writer and a PI and she is a great storyteller. She reminds me of what CJ used to be. I also like how when she adds in personal experience, its actually relevant and gives you a better idea of the case (unlike with CJ). It is also interesting to see the pattern of how white collar criminals can turn to murders and how it can be hard to see that. I still like and listen to CJ, but Red Collar has for sure become my new favorite which is why I'd love to find a sub that talks about the cases like on this one.	20210701T144159
anonymous	Patron June Episode - Alloura Wells	26	0	"Totally delete this post if it's not in the right place but... So I subscribe to the CJ patreon feed. I'm one of those less than awesome people who will subscribe once, binge, and then unsubscribe after I've exhausted all the additional content. At the beginning of the month I subscribed to the $10 and I've just gotten the exclusive episode on the Mysterious Death of Alloura Wells and...guys. It's awful. First and foremost: I have nothing wrong with stories about people from the LGBTQ+ community. Not at all. I really respect the fact that CJ tries to highlight cases whose victims are marginalized and less likely to be highlighted because of the minority/marginalized communities they belong to. HOWEVER I think this episode was anything but respectful. Unlike other mysterious death episodes, there was no actual content on what possibly happened to Alloura. No reports. No theories. Ashley threw in a few comments about ""maybe something happened, maybe it didn't"" but there was no investigation here. Ultimately, we don't even know if a crime was committed. All we know is that Alloura Wells is dead. Her body was found and it took the work of a concerned stranger and Alloura's family hounding their respective local police departments for anyone to realize what had become of her. Subsequently, this episode is a glaring example of how CJ is pandering to communities its hosts don't identify with or belong to to appear ""woke""/""politically correct""/whatever else you want to call it. This episode was a sever misstep in my opinion. While Alloura deserves to be remembered and respected, her story was not used to advocate for any sort of investigation into her untimely death. Instead, it was used to get likes and downloads and reviews for podcasters desperate to save face and scrambling for material to use during Pride month that (let's be real) they probably wouldn't have bothered to cover were it not June."	20210629T004959
shenlyism	Welcome to the Tribe: r/CJforbadpeople	13	0	Hey everyone! First mods, hope this post is okay. The end goal is hopefully to alleviate some of the tensions going on in this sub but I’m happy to take down if you don’t want this promoted in this sub. Backstory: So this was a community made after seeing a desire in what I consider the “main” Crime Junkie subreddit. This subreddit has been an awesome place to share honest opinions about Crime Junkies, but lately there seems to be an internal struggle about the balance of posts that rant about the show. Growing tired of that same old response, I went ahead and created r/CJforbadpeople, based off the of the r/Morbidforbadpeople subreddit. I hope this place to just be another outlet for people to honestly talk about Crime Junkies. At this point, there aren’t many rules about what you can’t post, just try to keep it civil. If more people post and the community feels the tone needs to shift, we can vote on that and make it happen. One of the only rules will be about post derailing. If someone says something you don’t like, the response “Well then stop listening” will not be allowed. People can share their feelings freely without you choosing to be personally offended. If you are, well you have other available subs to visit and participate in.

galaxy1026	One thing I really like about CJ...	128	0	...the ENUNCIATION. Lol. I've listened to every episode of cj, many a few times. I've recently circled back to a few other crime podcasts and began to appreciate how clearly Brit & Ashley speak. Some other hosts mumble a bit or talk so fast, or with little inflection that the info tends to run together. I know some terms they use can become annoying- I fully acknowledge it but I really appreciate how clear and easy they are to hear. Just sharing my 2 cents.	20210625T231415

txbredbookworm	It's cool if you don't agree ...	16	0	We aren't all going to think the same. It's okay to have differing opinions while remaining polite and respectful. I'm a part of Gilmore Girl fanbase on Reddit (I have a point, don't worry). Oftentime, I'm finding posts of people analyzing to a degree of the various characters, their relationships with each other, how maybe the scene could have gone better, what couple relationships work and don't, how Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life sucks or doesn't, etc. And it's cool that people feel good to express themselves. But when I think to express myself, I hate feeling like I'm going to get admonished, ridiculed, or belittled for my point of view. And when I come here: it's like the direct opposite of Crime Junkie Groups on Facebook, (and the feeling I get a part of Gilmore Girls subreddit). There, it seems like everyone worships the ground Ashley and Brittany walk on. Which is how I was almost a year and a half ago. (Think January 2020 when I discovered them).. But after the plagiarism scandal, that really cool thread this user posted earlier (y'all know the one) plus their own citations of red alerts .. I just stopped loving them. I got annoyed with how Ashley was annoyed with Brittany's questions. And, I was annoyed for Brittany even commenting. Ashley's 'crying' these recent months for sympathy came across insincere. Funnily enough, I don't want a script. I want more free flowing conversation between two people, (how I feel Morbid, Anxious and Afraid are. (Please enlighten me of any red alerts for these podcasts too) something that is truly candid, funny, and enjoyable. When I found this subreddit, I fell in love. Finally, it's okay if my opinion is stated, negative or otherwise. Some of y'all may be wondering, 'Jeez. If you hate Crime Junkie that much, why are you still listening to the podcast or subscribed to the Discussion Group on Facebook?' And honestly, I only go there for the Be Weird Wednesdays, where people share their almost worst moments. It intrigues me and prepares me to stay more aware and safe. And, I listen, because I want to be up to date on crimes I don't know of. But.. I'm stepping away soon. Please excuse me if I have offended anyone, or made it a little less fun to listen to the podcast. I can tell you this. The first couple of years they were on, it felt so warm and cozy, I was enjoying everything, I had the rose tinted glasses, and they could do no wrong. But these highlights from other users, the plagiarism scandal. They have opened my eyes to the fact that these girls; they make mistakes. And continue to .. change for the worst. I'm done making them my number one. I've already found Morbid, Anxious and Afriad, Without a Trace, True Evidence, Up and Vanished, a few others I'm forgetting. It's time to spice up my love of True Crime. Thanks for listening to my OPINION piece. Y'all stay safe, be aware, and punch someone in the throat if they get too close for comfort.	20210624T071710
girasolgoddess	audiochuck	8	0	hi i’m new to reddit in general — i’d just read specific threads on cases i was watching a documentary on or listening to a podcast episode about at the time, but was always deterred by the absolute deluge of information available — and i don’t really know how to search or find if a question has already been discussed so i apologize if this is redundant. i’m also late to the party with hearing about the plagiarism allegations (i’d say they’re more than allegations especially after listening to the “let’s taco ‘bout true crime” episode on it, but for the sake of civility) and i’m pretty distressed because plagiarism hits such a nerve with me trauma wise. does anyone know if there are similar allegations against all of audiochuck’s productions? i feel like that’d be a no, especially since some like red collar & counterclock & the other one delia hosts that slips my mind are all by investigative journalists who surely know the importance of citing your sources if from no other perspective than journalistic ethics… but now i’m super nervous and skittish. plagiarism is one of my very specific triggers so i know it may seem like i’m blowing this out of proportion, but i really am destroyed by this	20210623T200129
PresentLink2799	Oh. My. Goodness. Please don't gloss over the plagiarism incident like I did.	184	0	"I know that the plagiarism scandal is old news - this is not a new take or breaking news. I don't know what it was, precisely, but I remember reading about the plagiarism and thinking, ""Oh that's kind of shitty"". I didn't give it the thought it truly merits or really understand the perspective of other creators. Like I remember reading that they had taken the episodes in question down, so I'm like okay, that sounds respectful and like they're owning their mistake in a way. If I'm being honest, I think I didn't think it was a big deal was probably because like, how often can true crime truly be original? Like a lot of cases are about facts, and yeah, they got lazy on the research, but I truly did dismiss it. BUT OH MY GOODNESS. In my last post, I followed a person's advice and listened to the Crime Junkie episode on ""Let's Taco About True Crime"". It floored me. ***I did not realize how egregious some of their theft was. My mouth dropped.*** IF I WOULD HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DID ON SUCH A DEGREE, I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN FIRED FROM MY JOB. And more than that, if I found out that any of my staff at work did something equivalent, at the very least, I would have put that person on a personal improvement plan. And I would be questioning my hire and his/her capacity to do their job. Please listen to it also and make up your own mind, but I am personally so glad that I am no longer endowing Ashley Flowers's lifestyle through my patreon subscription. I am like ... in awe of how much Crime Junkie glossed over the very clear evidence of how much they stole. I can't believe I gave them my money which I earned for my own work. It really got me that one of the episodes they're currently accused of plagiarizing is their ""Women of Juarez"" case. There's just something so fucking sinister to be about Ashley, a woman who has the language of diversity and inclusion and stole content from POC. It doesn't make it worse/better than stealing from all podcasts, but it's like ""What the fuck do they truly believe if they cannot connect their actions with their beliefs?"" Like they're very vocal about their beliefs, many of which I subscribe to, but now none of them seem genuine. I don't know, y'all might disagree, but seriously, I hope you at least give it more thought than I originally did. I think they're benefiting from the privilege that they so rightly are trying to equal out in this world. I can't even imagine the disrespect that authors that were stolen from feel. Now that I understand the depth and more of the podcast world, I just can't believe I didn't connect the dots."	20210623T200108

lisa-quinn	Help me figure out which story is this, please!	3	0	"I've listened to all of the episodes, huge fan. I have this story in my head, I figure it's from Crime Junkie but I'm not 100% sure. I was pretty sure it was one of the first ones so I went tru them but I haven't found it yet and even reading tru the show notes on the others, I still can't figure it out. &#x200B; This story is about a woman (I don't remember if she's murdered and/or missing) that starts her day pretty normal, she has a job where she has this task to ""pick up"" stuff from a warehouse and drop them in other places. I'm thinking it's clothes, but I could be wrong. She does this pretty early in the morning, maybe before or right at dawn. So in the story this is the part where something happens to her. I think she does pickup the stuff in the warehouse, people see and talk to her there, but then, troughout the morning, people begin to realize that she doesn't do the other things she's supposed to do. Like she doesn't show up to other things and I even think at some point they find her car (maybe van?) in one of the stores where she's dropping part of the stuff from the warehouse - but she's not there? I don't remember details about this. I don't remember what happened to her or all the investigation part. Because I can't find it, it's become an itch I can't scratch. There's a chance I heard it in another show but even so, maybe you guys can recognize the story and enlighten me. &#x200B; Thank you so much!"	20210623T172002

Alarming_Reception88	Why is Britt so annoying	94	0	I know I’m not the only one who has said this or thinks it, but she literally ruins it for me. Her questions/concerns almost never make sense and sometimes I feel like even Ashley gets annoyed. Ive noticed in newer podcasts that her responses sound scripted/planned out which is just ridiculous because whats even the point? Might as well not even be on it if you cant say what you think. When it doesnt sound scripted, it is irrelevant or misses the point completely OR just repeats everything Ashley just said. Sorry, I had to come rant bc I cant stand it anymore. She also takes forever to finish a thought/sentence which makes it drag. Some of you may not like this comment but I’m honestly just over it lol.	20210622T001918

PresentLink2799	Unpopular opinion: What happened to Ashley and Brit?	173	0	"First of all - I love one of this group's rules, to ""behave like you would in real life"". I think that's so important so that's what I'm going to strive for here. I canceled my patreon subscription to Crime Junkie over the weekend and I couldn't quite put my finger on it as to why, but I think it's outgrown my taste and style. When I first started listening to it, Ashley and Brit were these friends who made a podcast. And sure, I thought Brit laughed at some not-ideal times, but I felt their compassion for victims just bleeding through. And Ashley was this girl who talked about those yoga pants that looked like work pants and they were stretchable above her belly pooch. She seemed so accessible. Then I think about the hydrojug ad that Brit did the vocal copy for, recently the one where she's like, ""We mentioned it here, so of course everyone's talking about it now."" And it kind of made my eyes rolled. You're selling waterbottles for a podcast, not curing Ebola, take it down a notch. I don't know - I don't want to shame these people for trying to make a profit. After all, they can't run a show without profit. It more just seems like a lot of the mediocrity is shining through, and not enough of the stuff that made their brand original, fresh, and kind. It's gotten lost in the growth."	20210621T142620

What are your opinions on pride month episodes (ones that cover crimes towards LGBTQIA+)? This can be from CJ or any true crime podcast.

avaughan11	The Devil Made Me Do It	2	0	So, I know Crime Junkie didn’t cover this case, but Ashley did in Supernatural. Has anyone watched the new Conjuring movie based on this real life case? I started binging Supernatural a couple weeks ago because I was out of CJ episodes, and I like listening to Ashley while I’m working. Her voice is soothing and I can zone out while concentrating on work, but still enjoy the background noise. I did that with The Devil Made Me Do It, and ended up replaying it so I could pay closer attention and I found it super intriguing. Then, my boyfriend read an article that the new Conjuring movie was based on a real life case about a man convicted of murder who claimed to be possessed and I realized I’d heard the case before. The movie obviously fabricates quite a bit, but I still found it a decent watch.	20210615T011221

Crafty-Interaction61	Brit’s Questions	104	0	Longtime listener here… is anyone else getting more and more annoyed with Brit’s questions/interjections where she literally just repeats what Ashley says in question form? Not at all a Brit hater or anything but it truly bugs the hell out of me. 95% of her “contributions” are just a “question” reiterating what Ashley said less than 2 minutes prior or a “*why don’t you read this for us Brit*?”. Edit: I truly think she should just read ads, do pruppet, and let Ash do the actual storytelling. This is not a bash on her, more of a quality control thing. I have talked to so many listener friends who get turned off near instantly because she makes it feel so scripted and disingenuous. Most have quit listening because of it. This style may appeal to the masses better but it also makes it more taboo - less bringing attention to victims and cases still needing to be solved and more entertainment/personal comment rooted.	20210607T224203

Source materials for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations. For a full list of sources, please visit https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/infamous-signal-mountain-murders/ I was excited to see this story told, since Kenneth Griffith (one of the victims) is my dad’s cousin. However… This episode missed a lot of the details of the case. This case had a long, difficult road to justice. I still live in the community and there’s a lot of speculation about the Casteel family and the son’s possible involvement. I recommend checking out the Unsolved Mysteries episode and, if you can find it, the City Confidential episode on this case.	20210601T223111

queenlolipopchainsaw	Truly my favorite true crime podcast	81	0	Shout out to Brit and Ash for all their hard work in putting together an enjoyable, easy to listen podcast! They are my introduction to true crime podcasts and I have yet to find one that's comparable. Even the most gory and horrible of details, something about Ashley's voice makes it easy to stomach! There are a few pruppet episodes I have enjoyed! Why do they call them pruppets anyway? At first I skipped around to a few cases I was familiar with like Laci Peterson and Elizabeth Smart and then I was hooked! So I started all the way at the beginning on my Google podcasts app. Seriously considering becoming a part of their Patreon Fan Club! I also love the history between Brit and Ash and their connection feels genuine. I love that they show their personalities through their episodes! I've loved true crime since I was a kid and I think that Crime Junkie really takes the cake in true crime podcasts!	20210531T152042

some-kind-of-rescue	Favorite cases to discuss/debate with other people?	13	0	I've recently gotten my boyfriend into listening to the podcast with me on our car rides. The episodes that have gone over best for him have been ones that are controversial and offer a lot to talk about, e.g. Bryce Laspisa and Kendrick Johnson. I *loved* the Darlie Routier episodes and wished I would have waited until I was with him to listen to those. Any recommendations for episodes that feature highly debated cases, or ones that you could talk about for hours? Thank you in advance!	20210527T204258

It sounded like they recorder in a completely empty echoey room. So far the only ones I've liked are OC Swingers and Very Presidential. I know I'm overly picky.

allehra	New v older eps	48	0	I've listened to CJ for quite a while and been a longtime lurker on the subreddit. I've long felt that something is missing from recent episodes. I've been going back thru the first ten eps and feel I've noticed some significant differences. Ashley used to be conversational, improvise bits of the story, and add her takes without sounding overly scripted. Brit's contributions were also more substantial and the two had a much more engaging back and forth/more friendly dynamic. I realize that after doing so many episodes, you fall into a rhythm; this is probably why Ashley sounds so clinical in her delivery nowadays. But I like hearing her real thoughts, in the moment! I like the inflection and banter. And I miss hearing Brit's unscripted reactions. It's not a dealbreaker for me thus far; plan to continue listening and don't see myself tapping out anytime soon. However, it is nice to finally be able to pin down what I feel has been missing. I almost wish they would make an effort to re-establish the dynamic, but I'd rather it be the way it is now than for it to feel overly forced, so I'm a little split. Thoughts? I know the general issue has been discussed here before...	20210524T232010

anonymous	Did anyone read the book “ I am Jessica” — Jeff Pelleys former stepsister	19	0	I was trying to get some more insight into the Jeff Pelley cases. I do mean cases, plural. So I read this book. First of all, she didn’t write it.. it was her cousin, a paralegal. Pretty crappy writing to be honest. I didn’t get a ton of knowledge about the overall Pelley cases... Well enough to change my mind on anything at least. The biggest Takeaway is I could understand the strife between the two families becoming blended. Jessica is very very very very different than Pelleys. So I assume Dawn was as well. Jessica is your hard-core party girl,really doesn’t seem to have a very strong faith in God at least right away. Jeff Pelley’s biological sister however, was and still is.. very into the church. Jeff Pelley’s sister — it’s very much “ I trust in God... God will forgive God knows best and all is good. My brother is innocent... even if he’s not I’m gonna pretend like he is... because it’s too much to face.” Jessica is very much “ I need more beer, I’m having a mental break down, I just can’t cope... I hate Jeff Pelley. Jeff Pelley did it and that’s the end of the story.” In other words, they have such different interpretations of the truth because they are so very different. It really does not make me think Jeff is guilty one way or the other. The book just made me realize... yeah I can see this blended family not getting along.	20210521T021747
HairyCallahan	Idea to hire a translator?	49	0	Hi all, Some Crime Junkie episodes are about foreign cases, like the Japanese case that just aired.

mb21247	Murder who tucked women in and set house on fire	22	0	Hi! For the past couple of months I've been thinking about one episode but can't seem to find it anywhere, it's really frustrating. It was about three men who escaped from prison (one older guy and two younger ones), they murdered a priest and his wife because they had money in a safe (or something like that). The older guy tucked the wife in bed and set the house on fire. He did that same tucking-in again to a different woman and got caught by her sister. It was very graphic and kept me on edge the whole time, but the episode seems gone. Does anyone know which case this was?	20210519T124956

Verdant_River	Red Collar and pronunciations	11	0	"Okay, so I thought it was just Ashley that can't seem to be bothered to pronounce people's names or town names correctly (LaVena Johnson was ""LaVenia"", in another episode she pronounced Greenwich phonetically when omg come on). But then there is today's episode of Red Collar, on the Lululemon murder. And granted, I live in and grew up in Rockville, which is just north of Bethesda, where this case took place, and used to meet up with friends at this store for weekly run club. I've changed in the dressing room they found Brittany Norwood ""tied up"" in, I saw and heard the nasty racism that nobody in this County likes to admit exists, especially among the richest residents. So maybe the fact that this case is one of my hometown cases is what's tipping me over the edge. But ""Besseda""?! Really Catherine?! BESSeda?! She even got it right at the beginning of the episode. But at 26:20 she decides on a whole new pronunciation. It's even written in the show notes as ""Bethseda."" And look, f*** Bethesda. It's bougie as hell and frankly I would normally giggle at the idea of Bethesda residents being like ""don't you know who we are?!"" But this has bothered me about CJ since LaVena Johnson because I think it's incredibly disrespectful to AT LEAST not get the name of the victim right. And now I shudder to think how many other names have been pronounced wrong that I just don't know any better myself, because whoever is ""researching"" cases for audiochuck cannot even be bothered."	20210518T142501

FlippantBuoyancy	Jeff Pelley probably didn't murder his family	217	0	Having just finished, I feel pretty certain that Jeff didn't do it. The person that Jeff would need to be is just inconsistent with the knowledge that Jeff had. Consider what Jeff-the-hypothetical-murderer had to do to make the 10-20 minute time window work: * Remove all unspent shotgun shells from the house OR ensure that there were only 6 shells to begin with. Why? Because if unfired shells were present in the house then the police would have compared those to the wadding. * Fired the shotgun in such a way that he would not be bruised by the recoil, six times. * Fired the shotgun in such a way that he would not be shredded by bone fragments. * Removed all his clothing and threw it in the wash after killing everybody, without leaving any bloody fingerprints. * Washed himself enough to remove all the blood splatter. * Removed the gun and himself from the house without being seen. * Somehow hid the gun before arriving at Darla's house, in such a way that police officers have never been able to find it. The problem for me is that Jeff-the-hypothetical-murderer would have needed to pre-plan this entire chain of events. Jeff-the-hypothetical-murderer would have needed to be quite careful to even make it to prom without being caught. However, this mastermind version of Jeff, Jeff-the-hypothetical-murderer, knew multiple things that would have prevented his own plan: * Jeff knew it was prom night. A night when multiple people were stopping by the house at ill-defined times. * Jeff knew that his dad had an appointment at 5:30, just twenty minutes later, to go and take pictures of Jeff's ex-girlfriend. * Jeff knew that his dad was due to give a sermon in the morning. * Jeff must have known that a shotgun would be quite loud, even from indoors. Yet, this version of Jeff decided to spend the time to clean up afterwards? * Jeff knew that his father was letting him to go prom and the events afterwards. We know this because his sister knew precisely where he would be. The prosecution panned Jeff as a cunning, psychopathic persona who carefully and deliberately planned the quadruple murder. He's a cold-blooded killer who remains calm throughout the subsequent events: dinner, prom, after-party, and six flags. If I assume that Jeff is the killer then I agree with their assessment. However, this careful, cunning, deliberate, psychopathic version of Jeff doesn't at all line up with the information that Jeff had. Viewed from Jeff's own perspective, 5:00 p.m. on Friday evening would have been an immensely unfavorable time to enact his plan. His selection of timing would have been careless, almost to the point of inviting apprehension. Informational Edit: This post is referring to the recent CC3 podcast.	20210512T040712

anonymous	Follow up to who Jeff Pelley killed	9	0	I have another post on here which is explaining the Pelley family and Hawley family background. See if you can read that before you read this post. As always, please forgive the typos because I do talk to text. In 1993 Jeff Pelley rammed a car in head-on, and killed one of the passengers. This is right around the time where he married Kimberly Hawley. Yes Phil Hawley’s niece. Jeff left Indiana and move down to Florida because he still was very close to the Hawleys. He had just leased a brand new vehicle a Honda from Honda finance. He did not take out any insurance on it which is going to be important here when I tell you this in a second. One morning supposedly on the way to the gym about 6 AM, he hit a car in his brand new car head on, and killed a woman named Janet Ady. Janet had three children and was married. Constance, Kimberly and a son. She was married to David Ady. David Ady’s was also in the vehicle but he did not die. Only Janet. Important to know that another person was involved in the accident and his name was Bob Elder, however I do not know the background on Bob Elder, other than he did not cause the accident. When Jeff Pelley asked asked at the scene by the cops what happened, he claimed “I fell asleep I fell asleep.” He said he put the car on cruise control even though this was not on a highway or freeway this was on a normal street. Said while it was on cruise control he fell asleep. Well guess what like I said he did not have insurance. As you recall in the Pelley case the idea that he did or did not have insurance in Indiana was a big deal. Cops had gone over that information with him so many times. Remember the insured or uninsured vehicle that he took to prom. I asked about why he didn’t have insurance he said and this is a quote “I didn’t know I don’t know I thought that they would take care of it.” Of course Jeff is an adult now and it’s 1993 and he absolutely knows that he needed insurance. Not to mention in so many newspaper articles I’ve read people describe Jeff as incredibly brilliant. Not just in the way of book smartness but also he had a ton of common sense and was very clever when it came to getting out of things. So for all intensive purposes I think we can be pretty confident that he knew he was supposed to have insurance. Well David Ady sued Jeff Pelley in Court in Florida for wrongful death. Since he could not bring a criminal claim against him he decided to bring a civil claim against him. As you may or may not know if a criminal murder case does not go through families do you have the option of pursuing it from a civil level. Is that person does not become imprisoned they can be forced to pay the families of the victims. This this ended up becoming a civil case. The civil case became so controversial that what started out as a local wrongful death suit in Florida ended up going all the way to the Florida Supreme Court. In fact the decision by the Florida Supreme Court drastically changed Florida insurance laws regarding leasing a vehicle and insurance; laws that still exist to this day because of that infamous supreme court case. Now you may think well that’s just a coincidence. It comes to human behavior yes everything can be different, but in reality people do have very similar behavioral patterns. For instance, we are seeing the case about insurance being repeated here again only a few years later. Also what is repeating itself is that there is someone dead. So let’s just say your family was involved in a huge family murder and then just a few years later you so happen to kill someone. Is that just Coincidence? Because now not only are we looking at insurance, people dying, but we’re also looking at huge well publicized court cases. Combine all those and it’s really history repeating itself. So I had two strong feelings right away when I read this information. One I was pretty confident that it had nothing to do with coincidence. However I didn’t know the motive. I thought it could be one of two things. The first thing is, when someone gets away with murder or a large publicize crime, the chances are as if they do it again are pretty high. Like in the case of Natalie Holloway. Did that young guy from Holland to wherever he was from set out to kill a young woman? Or did it end up becoming incredibly thrilling that he was involved in such a case got such a notoriety and got away with it that he had developed an inflated sense of ego and crave to do it again? Well he did do it again for no reason three years later. This time he was convicted. Now here’s the rest of the story which I’m sure Ashley and Delia WILL plagiarize, because that’s what they do, which really sucks. My other theory was, perhaps perhaps there was a connection between Jeff Pelley and the people that he hit. I had thought perhaps he ain’t to die in a murder suicide, Because he had a history of suicidal thoughts. He intentionally wanted to kill these particular people because he had some connection to them. So I started by trying to disapprove the theory that there was any sort of connection at all to Janet and David Ady. Well guess what I found a huge connection. Is one of those moments where you have a gut feeling and you don’t know why you have a gut feeling but suddenly you’ve got to prove and then you just feel very emotional and exhausted. Difficult to go off of a gut feeling without having any proof so this is why it’s really important. I did a ton of research on David Ady. Remember his wife was killed in a car accident by Jeff Pelley but he was also in the vehicle on their way to work. David Eddie comes from the same set of small towns in Ohio right next to each other that Bob Pelley did. And both Bob Pelley an Dawn Pelley and Janet and David Ady’s are or were all the same age. In these small towns especially back then the max population maybe two or 300. Even today in small town today you better bet that people in the small towns know people in the other small towns very well especially people in their same age group. So now it appears there was a very good statistically speaking, good chance of Bob Pelley knowing David Ady. I based this research on ancestry and marital records, as well as other vital records in the courts. I also researched this case in Florida by reviewing the actual court documents and briefs. Next I research the Pelley and Adys in Ohio. Bob Pelley‘s father was a pentecostal Reverend. Lo and behold David Ady’s mother was also a Pentecostal reverend in the next town over. I also found out that a Bob Pelley an David Ady’s went to church camp in Ohio together. This is a church camp that started out in the 1800s and is still going today. Next both Bob Pelley an David Ady’s went to college got got out of there small towns in Mount Vernon Ohio. At the same time. Then what happened is both Bob Pelley an David Ady moved to Florida and joined the same Nazarene church in Florida. And David‘s mother who is the Reverend also moved to Florida and became part of the church. In fact David Ady’s coincidentally or not was also part of the united Brethern church in Ohio. The same denomination that Bob Pelley became a Reverend of an Indiana. Now approximately four years after the Pelleys were killed, somehow Jeff Pelley rams into David Ady’s and Janet Ady so hard that he kills Janet Ady. IN FLORIDA. Yes in a completely different state. Even though they were all from the same small towns in Ohio now they were all living in Florida together. If it were Sunday and maybe they were on the way to church OK maybe I would understand. But no this was at 6 AM in the Ady’s were heading to work. This is far from a coincidence and I think prosecutors and police know this. I think Jeff did this purposely for one of two reasons. First reason is perhaps he found out that David Ady was involved in the death of his family in Indiana. And then he wanted to seek revenge. I fully believe that he intended on killing them both. The other reason is someone in Jeff Pelleys network in the Nazarene church wanted the Ady’s dead and asked Jeff to do it. Jeff could’ve done that purposely because maybe he was used to killing because he also killed his father stepmother and half siblings. That is the part I do not have answers to. But I really would like to find is toxicology reports accident scene reports, etc. in fact did Jeff normally go to the gym? Again I think prosecutors and Cops know about this link. Is he potentially innocent of the crimes in Indiana, but guilty of killing Janet Ady? They already have him in prison for 160 years and decided not to pursue the case in Florida because he may get off? Exploring a new case is risky. A lot of times criminals do time for different crimes. In this particular case this is what I think the outcome will be. I don’t think Jeff is ever going to get out of prison and win an appeal. I think the Hawleys are going to go ahead and live their lives and hopefully with generations all of this will fade away. Although Jeff Pelley son did get arrested in 2019 for a DUI and let me tell you he looks really rough in general. I would hope his generation be the one to stop this cycle. Someone needs to pay for all these crimes in in this case I think Jeff is the one that’s representing all that’s happened by his imprisonment. If you know about the thin blue line what you know it’s even thinner today with the defunding of police. Florida cops have so much more to do and so much more recent cases to solve that I think that they’re perfectly happy and same with Indiana about Jeff doing time for all of this and then all of this will never be completely solved. Well let me rephrase that, I think it’s solved privately I think the cops and prosecutors know I just don’t think we the public will know. I feel really horrible for Janet Ady’s children. They have not had an easy life. I hope that everyone can Move on as Jeff will stay in prison for the rest of his life.	20210507T002548
anonymous	The truth CounterClock won’t tell you (yet) about Jeff Pelley	9	0	OK. Background, I became obsessed with this case because the Pelley and Hawley families mimic mine, to an uncomfortable degree. And down to the very small details. So let me start by saying I’ve done extensive research and am not here to entertain you. I’m here to tell you the truth. In 1993, after the Pelley murders, Jeff killed an innocent 42 year old mother in Florida. These are facts and the court cases and legal briefs are public. I say “cases” — because the wrongful death lawsuit (civil) went all the way to the Florida Supreme Court. And changed FL laws forever. Now I want to tell you about the Pelley and Hawley family dynamic, if you are able to have any sympathy or empathy, this may help understand (though I don’t condone). My family came from Ireland like the Pelley’s and Hawleys (I researched their ancestry). It’s hard to believe now, but people were extraordinarily prejudiced against the Irish then, and even still so in England. The US government provided the Irish land grants in small Midwestern towns. In fact I still have some of these original land deeds. These were rural small towns and Irish families bonded together. They were poor and were farmers. Many of them at that time joined non-Catholic churches, mine started out as 7th Day Adventist at first. These families bonded together and honestly they really didn’t play by the rules. They had their own mini government so to speak, their own way of doing things and their own justice system. My great grandparents my grandfather my father and all his brothers were the same way. Did they kill people go to prison come out of prison ? kill someone again? Yes they did. Was it because these people did them wrong and they knew the justice system would never take care of it? It could be; sometimes it seems that way. They didn’t really associate with other people at all outside the family and then a family that someone would marry into. You have to understand with people like the Pelley’s in the Hawleys that is their entire social network. They really don’t associate with other people, unless it’s people in their church. In the church or my Pentecostal sense is extraordinarily political and also really a form of government and brotherhood. For instance, I could really never bring anyone home a friend because that person would be considered an outsider. Somehow the culture was, whatever they needed to do to survive because of their families and the generations before were so poor, I guess society was unwilling to give them an upper hand, that they somehow felt justified in cheating the system. Again, I am not condoning any of this. This is the reason I stay far far away from them; Except of course for my cousins who are really bonded with because they went through the same life as I did. I grew up in Lenexa Kansas, where the church of Nazarene was formed. We had land there and my grandfather also became involved in real estate development. So because I know so much about the history of my family and it’s so similar to the Pelleys and Hawleys I just wanted to explain the background. One of the best ways I can sum it up is, the rules don’t really apply to them. God and the sense of brotherhood is what ultimately prevails.	20210506T232059

There is no variety in episodes anymore. It's a singular missing or murdered woman every week - every single week it's a new iteration of the same story. I'm not saying these stories don't deserve to be heard, but each one of them would carry more weight if they were interspersed with episodes like The Pickton Farm, Bryce Laspisa, Darlie Routier, Israel Keys, Charlie Brandt, Brian Shaffer, Robert Wone, Oklahoma Girl Scouts, etc. There was a massive drop in variety and quality over the last year and a half, which I don't understand. The past few weeks, I've been relistening to their older episodes, and there is no comparison. What happened?

catrod	Red Collar ads at the start of each episode of Counter Clock Episode	0	0	So I am only up to episode 13 of 20 for Counter Clock (sort of a slow binge!), but I have been waiting for this episode since the start. I knew nothing of this case before hand and was excited/interested after the Crime Junkie ep on the case. But saying at the start of each episode “after this, you’ll want to listen to Red Collar” I knew there had to be some sort of “twist” coming regarding Bob’s previous job. Clearly I still have a fair way to go in this story, but I just felt like the suspense and the story telling got ruined with this ad because it wasn’t hard to figure out where this was/is going.	20210505T202943

anonymous	Jeff Pelley and the Hawleys, Season 3 Counter Clock - FL organized crime families	52	0	I’ve come to the conclusion that this story has very little to do with Jeff being guilty or not guilty. The bigger picture is that we’re dealing with redneckish-turned-high society semi-organized crime families from Florida. I live here and I can see these types a mile away, living in their swamps and coastline areas. With their very non-sophisticated 22s. I think the Hawleys have the Gulf Coast/NW Florida all the way east to Gainesville. I think Bob Pelley (or whatever his name may have been) was part of it. Jeff married a Hawley and his son is now a 3rd generation potential degenerate, arrested for a DUI and looking rough in 2019. More than just a kid rebelling. And Jeff had various troubles himself, that had nothing to do with his family that night. Has anyone looked at Bob Pelley’s childhood? How he grew up, what his family was like? This seems like generations of apples falling from the tree and families joined for generations here. Hawleys marrying Pelleys... being close friends... I think the Feds called in to the Indiana murders and told local cops to blame the son and stay out of the investigation; that Bob and the Hawleys were part of a larger an ongoing investigation tied to quasi-organized crime, akin to the Miami Vice scene, just further up north along the coast. Same with Eric Dawson’s murder. The Hawleys got off because again, it was part of a larger investigation. But then the lead investigators passed away, and so did the prosecutors, and who knows how that fizzled out over the years. Crimes turned cyber and other organized crime flourished. At the end of this Season, I just thought “Jeff who?” I mean, we are watching generations of pseudo-Florida no-gooders just go on and on. It has nothing to do with that prom, and nothing to do with Jeff — other than he is a small piece of a bigger puzzle. Let’s just say I grew up a very similar way, and some patterns and events, you just recognize right away. Maybe it’s a generational curse, or maybe it’s just built in one’s DNA.	20210504T044628
pineapplebutonpizza	Other podcast recommendations?	12	0	I know I’ve already commented on a few posts but the commentary from Britt and the constant repeat of the really cringe quotes have pushed me too far. I like the storytelling of the true crimes although I wish they added a little bit more details on the actual crimes and less about the sucks that the person disappearing is just so not like them. So I’m looking for another true crime podcast that gives off similar good stories telling vibes but has A lot more details and not the stupid commentary. Plus, every 10 minutes is an ad for something I’m literally never going to purchase some pretty over this podcast. I’ll probably still listen every once in a while but after having to skip every time Britt starts to talk about how she adopted kids and how Ashley says that it’s giving her full body chills I am definitely not as much is a fan. I do like that they bring light on not so popular stories especially about black Americans or women and sex work who stories were not taken seriously but it’s just becoming too much and too childish. Sorry diehard fans.	20210504T034226

walks_into_things	Missing: Diane Augat and Mental Health	28	0	On the podcast that came out today, the hosts get into mental health and mental health awareness, particularly the mental health issue of bipolar disorder as it’s involved in the case. I hope we can all agree that it’s important to normalize discussing mental health and treatment. However, how the hosts addressed it and the commentary they made, outside of sharing how this victim experienced it herself, came off rather odd to me. What did you think of how they presented mental health & bipolar today?	20210503T131605

shenlyism	Rave: I always appreciate how CJ links to and lays out the case photos.	73	0	I think we all probably have our own experience of listening to Crime Junkie, but one of mine is to always check the episode sources and see the victim photo as they introduce the case. I’ve looked like an absolute nut job stopping in the middle of the sidewalk to frantically look at a case photo to understand what I’m hearing because I’m so transfixed on the case. I feel like it really helps to remember the person behind the case and that they were more than just their final moment. Not sure if any other podcasts do that like they do, but it’s always something I’ve appreciated.	20210502T201653

Anybody-West	Ashley needs to let Brit talk.	94	0	I’ve been listening to CJ for a few months now and I started from the first episode and now I’m in early 2019. And I just want to say.... LET BRIT SPEAK. Most of the time she gets a few words or phrases and MAYBE an ad. Like I get she has other jobs and I get she’s a mom so she may not want as much responsibility as Ashley. But just let her speak. And the amount of times Ashley refers to CJ as “her show” pisses me off. And the amount of times she mentions how cool of a nine year old she was is infuriating. As someone who was always the “Brit”in friend in the past that never got a word in and was pushed out of the picture, I feel for Brit because she almost never gets to speak or share her perspective unless it’s about her being a mom and relating to the victims’ families. Don’t get me wrong, I love the show and I love how the are able to sum up complicated stories but for the love of God please let Brit speak and please stop bringing random things back to your own life.	20210501T172020

Lizzymorales	It's not the same	3	0	I'm pretty late to the party but I wanted to make sure I listened to this weeks entire episode before posting my opinion on it. I agree, these episodes where they tease another podcast are annoying but I can't blame them for drawing me into their next project. Where MY issue lies is the fact that after these teases I get so excited because they sold it so well but when I get to the podcast it's almost never Ashley or Brit. I am super picky about my podcasts. Sometimes it's the sound quality, the voice or attitude of the speak or sometimes even the way the story is outline but so many little things can make it impossible for me to enjoy. I listen to CJ, get sucked it and then disappointed when I can't enjoy it. I know Ashley and Brit are busy woman who can't do it all but the disappointment makes these teaser episodes so much harder to tolerate.	20210429T153654

BougieBasic	CJ ruined podcasts for me	120	0	CJ was my first intro into Podcasts about 6 months ago but now that I am all caught up I have nothing to listen to. I have tried so many other podcasts but none have come close to keeping my engagement like CJ has. I either don't like the monotone voices that give me a bullet list of crime details or there is too much banter to keep me interested. There have been a few crime podcasts which engaged me enough to listen to all episodes, but the other 100 have been quickly unsubscribed. I love crime stories but now I find myself searching for other topics of interest to listen to. I am interested in real stories, not narrated fiction. Something along the lines of a documentary maybe. Anyone have any ideas?	20210428T215109

Art3sian	This Podcast gets progressively more annoying.	50	0	I found Crime Junkies a few weeks ago and thought it was an awesome find. I started at the oldest casts and worked my way forward. At about episode 10, it’s pretty clear that their plan changes to monetise the fuck out of everything. Intrusive ads, sponsors, and endorsements start rolling through everything, but it’s the *‘pay us on Patreon to hear the end of the podcast’* that really pissed me off. The next thing that got to me was their Cali-girl lingo. *“Like... totally... like... literally....like....”* Are we 12, ladies? Once you focus on the ‘likes’ and ‘literallys’ you can’t unhear them, and they start to totally... like... 100%... burn your... like... literal ears! So anyway, I’m out. It’s a cool idea but it falls over pretty quickly, especially due to greed. EDIT: To all of you fangurls who can’t handle this post and/or keep inboxing me your tears... 1. If something goes out into the public arena, it’s up for public ridicule. That’s been the way of the internet since about 1995 and the way of entertainment since about the 16th century. Consider this a review. 2. You don’t have to like my review. 3. There’s nothing in the sidebar of this sub that says I must only post compliments. The fact that this is still here means the mods are okay with my post. 4. I have no problem with turning a profit. Asking for money to hear the end of the story is a wank move though. 5. I make no apologies for expecting journalism/reporting, even at amateur level, to use grown up language. The exception to this rule is a podcast specifically centred around how 12 year olds speak, or anything on YouTube Kids.	20210426T190601

Then I discovered Trace Evidence and... it's just better in my opinion. It's not about Steven, it's solely about the case. No *gasp*, no drama, no scripted semiproductive questions. It feels like there are also less adds, but I might be wrong about that, I haven't counted. The episodes area little longer and my impression is that Steven is more thorough in his research and he seems more respectful to me. I feel he does the pod because he enjoys it, which makes it more fun for me to listen to him. I feel that both formats are similar in storytelling and buildup, but for me personally, TE is clearly the better podcast.	20210414T122414

anonymous	Fewer ads at the beginning of each episode please	15	0	I was very annoyed at having to get through 3 minutes of ads at the start of yesterday's episode to get to the actual podcast. I would definitely prefer if there were fewer ads I needed to listen to/skip before getting to the podcast intro.	20210406T133939
BelleLabz	Leaving Crime Junkie	15	0	My boyfriend and I have decided to stop listening to Crime Junkie. We really liked the show for the cases they cover but can no longer stand/support Ashley’s demeanor when talking to Brit. She is constantly dismissive and undermining any input Brit gives. It’s extra sad to me because clearly Ashley Flowers has certain phenotypical privileges that Brit does not, but can’t seem to stand Brit shining even with minor comments during the show. If anyone has better a podcast recommendations, please let me know.	20210406T043452
Visible-Hat-7708	Patron episode Laura Wallen weird psa	15	0	Did anyone listen to the most recent patron episode? Nothing wrong with the episode overall but at the end Ashley does one of her PSAs. This PSA seemed a bit off, she pointed out even if your partner isn’t abusive they could still kill you. Which though she said it wasn’t victim blaming it seemed a little like she thought the victim should of known this. And it’s kind of weird to say that in general you partner might kill you with no signs.	20210406T013218

Does it bother anyone else?	28	0	Does anyone else notice the way Ashley tells the story like shes putting emphasis on every last word in the sentence? Like is that annoying or is it just me? If she would just tell the story in a normal tone, without trying to act out every last word, it would be a much better podcast. It just takes away from the overall story when you cast all that shit every second minute. Its sooooo fucken theatrical like are you forgetting youre talking about a victim here? It honestly feels like im listening to a wannabe actress try out for a voice casting and fail miserably. Bruh	20210405T141900

Zippyss92	Need help finding an episode	1	0	Okay, I wanna say the episode was from the last year or so, though I could be wrong. The case was in Texas, and a man killed his long time friend because he found out he was gay and “I felt he was coming on to me and I panicked and that’s how he’s dead now” and it was used as a defense as well. The only thing I truly remember was that they used a scratchy record sound to say what the name of the defense. Any help folks?	20210404T214411
jibramango	Funny thought from a new listener	62	0	It took me a while to start this podcast because I’m so used to the scripted and dramatic storytelling of Casefile and Canadian True Crime. I’ve really grown to like it though but I noticed a big thing that I wonder if anyone else has found funny. There’s a lot of times where Ashley will talk about the case and Brit will make a comment. And the comment can be something so small and then Ashely will respond with just “right” or there’ll be some silence. It kinda sounds like she looking at her like she just got interrupted. I know it’s not meant to be that way at all and it’s more of a back and forth between the two but I don’t know why I find it so funny just picturing her giving her a dirty look😂😂😂	20210404T140753

CH4cows	Is anyone else really scared of men after bingeing this podcast?	20	0	I’ve recently become a huge fan of the podcast and I probably listen to 1-2 episodes a night. However, I’ve noticed that most of the stories they cover, at least in their MURDERED or SERIAL KILLER episodes, are female homicides perpetuated by men. I’m curious as to why this is. Is it because of the target audience they are trying to reach with their content? Is it because these types of homicides are most heavily covered by the media and make for the most “interesting” story? Or is it because the majority of violent crimes are in fact committed by men against women? I enjoy the podcast and I appreciate its messages. I do feel that I’ve become more alert and situationally aware since listening to the show. However I think it’s also making me become increasingly afraid and untrusting of men.	20210401T043203

The one I’m looking for is about a young woman who’s a dancer or something along those lines that gets hired for a party and isn’t seen again after said party. The most distinct part I remember is the friend of the missing woman calling someone who was thought to have been with her/seen her last and the person asking “oh, you want to know what her last words were, don’t you?” Sorry I can’t remember more! Solved! Angie Barlow’s disappearance and murder. Episode is Najah//Angie from April 2020! Thanks so much everyone!	20210331T202047

mediaproject2345	Questions regarding the True Crime Community	20	0	Hey all! My name’s Hannah, and I’m a junior majoring in history and media studies. For my Research Methods class, I have to do a deep dive into a community I am a part of, so I thought the ‘true crime’ community would be the best to explore. I’m a big fan of the podcast and everything true crime. My interest started with Law and Order on cable tv when I was for sure too young to be watching it. Over the years, I got into the genre on youtube and made my way to podcasts (which by far is my favorite form of the genre). I would love to get all of your insight on your love and thoughts on the true-crime genre for my research. I will change all names and any personal information in my paper to keep anonymity. Also, the paper is only for the class, my professor will be the only one reading it. No pressure in answering all the questions; any response is greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much for your time! 1. How did you get into the community? Have you had a previous interest in the genre? 2. Are there certain stories/cases you are more interested in? 1. Unsolved? Solved? Modern? 3. Are there specific stories you stray away from? And why? 4. What’s your favorite form of true crime media to consume? And why? 5. Are you an active member of an online community or in your personal life regarding true crime? 6. What is the one case you wish could be solved? 7. How do you think others perceive the community?	20210330T191331

meagan_lewis	Help me find an episode!!	4	0	EDIT: Solved in comments ❤️ Okay so I SWEAR I heard this on Crime Junkie (I think the patreon feed) but I can't find it and it's driving me mental. So a little kid is kidnapped/murdered (I think a young girl but maybe I'm wrong?) Anyways they have a suspect but he won't admit anything, so the police set up this super elaborate sting, get the guy to join some fake organised crime gang (of which the suspect doesn't know its fake) and they earn his trust, and then he admits it to the 'head of the gang' who's really an undercover cop and has the whole thing recorded. Does this sound familiar to anyone?!?!?	20210326T091817

anonymous	Similar straightforward true crime podcasts without the banter?	76	0	I first got into CJ because they don't waste tons of time adding commentary or anecdotes, but now that they've gone downhill, I'm looking for recommendations for other true crime podcasts out there. I tried MFM and while Karen and Georgia are interesting storytellers, I'm not really interested in all the extra discussion and 45 minutes of intro talk time if that makes sense lol. I'm also getting into Morbid but I feel like I don't enjoy their storytelling as much as I did with CJ's initial episodes. Can anyone recommend other straightforward true crime podcasts similar to CJ's early days? Thank you!! **EDIT:** thank you all for your amazing suggestions!! I'm going to go through and check out each one of the recommendations, I can't believe there were so many shows out there that I was missing out on lol	20210323T163243

Background_Lead_6754	Inappropriate title - Call to rebrand?	1	0	This is something that has been on my mind for years now. I finally sent this email to the general inquiries inbox. I am wondering if anyone else feels similarly to me. Has anyone else felt that this was an inappropriate name from day one? If so, maybe consider emailing as well. I think this is important. Seeing the words Crime Junkie in my weekly podcast feed make the words lose meaning over time. I don't doubt that the podcast hosts may not realize the harm they are causing. Nonetheless, language is powerful and we need to keep everyone accountable, especially those with large audiences. &#x200B; *Hi there,* *I am a long time listener of Crime Junkie podcast. I'm a big fan, but from day one, I've always been turned-off by the use of the term 'junkie'.* *The podcast also used to have pills making out the podcast name as branding. I'm glad that the podcast has moved away from that.* *Unfortunately, the word 'junkie' is problematic. Please don't use the word - it is dehumanizing to people in the throes of addiction. Substance abuse and addiction are mental health problems and the failures of society in general.* *The podcast's hosts both advocate for mental health and people getting help (this is also evident through their sponsorship deals). I appreciate this and in no way am I trying to have this podcast cancelled or attacked.* *I understand that rebranding is expensive: both financially and in every type of resource. It is completely disruptive to the company. However, I strongly believe that destigmatizing addiction is more important.* *Thank you for your time.*	20210319T185637

anonymous	Genuine question for the crime junkie haters, why are you still here??	194	0	So many times I look on here and there’s so many people that just want to bash Crime Junkie as a show or Ashley and Brit as a duo. I know about the plagiarism scandal, we all do trust me we do it’s everyone’s first argument. They did something bad but haven’t they also brought more attention to cases that need it when so few would have heard about it? Do I agree Brit has been progressively getting restricted in what she says, yes! Guess what your not bringing up a new opinion in that. In the beginning Brit always asked the questions I had or the points I thought of too, it was like having a voice while listening. If you’re only going to focus on the bad, then leave. If you can’t bring anything positive or productive to the conversation, then leave. If you just want to complain about the same old thing and say how much you hate them and don’t listen to them anymore, cool then leave, and guess what you don’t have to listen! There’s always going to be something they say or do in an episode people don’t like, if it can lead to a good discussion between true crime lovers that’s awesome. It’s what we all came here for, but if you just want to bash then move onto your new podcast you love instead and get over it.	20210319T110453

What are the reasons that a truly guilty person would lie about their innocence years and years after being in prison? Thank you :)	20210228T180322

Scottish_Assassin78	Maybe a dumb opinion.	8	0	Iv listened to most of this show. Iv now heard 2 maybe 3 episodes where I woman was convicted of murder where Ashley and Britt pull out all the stops to say that they were wrongly convicted. However a lot of the things they roll their eyes at and call a product of the time are things that are super fishy and should have been enough to lock up male cases. Am I crazy or is there a bias here. Not to say I dislike the show at all listen to it everyday . But they seem incapable of casting women in a bad light . There was an episode where the murders was the husbands wife and best friend and they really honed in on the best friend and his wife was more a foot note . It’s odd . And can make their opinions seem a bit watered down . This isn’t the only place with double standards , it seems they are in favor of anything that confirms their conviction more than just relaying facts of a case.	20210223T230532

su_sonnytag	How do you feel about current episodes and how they address plagiarism?	24	0	As a disclaimer, I do admit to paying the $10 range for additional content. I truly like Ashley Flowers’ narration and her audio quality is good compared to other true crime podcasts. They also don’t do as much side talk as My Favorite Murder, but sprinkle in opinions occasionally. With all that being said, I do not condone plagiarism and was saddened to hear that they had plagiarized a lot of material. I will say, I do still listen. I’ve noticed in the past six months that they have heavily cited their resources either within the content or at the end of the episode. They also cite in the description. I’m wondering if this is enough for people to start listening again. I think she does a good job with the audio and narration, so would be eager to hear if she’s done enough to get listeners back. I personally would like them to address this on their social media platforms but I guess they’re trying to protect their brand and not taint it. Many people don’t know about the plagiarism and to address this on their end could definitely hurt their brand and business. However, I think if they were more transparent, they would regain back the followers who stopped listening in the first place. Again, I do not condone plagiarism and credit should always be given where it’s due. However, I think they’ve done much better with their recent episodes in terms of citation and referring links to articles. This industry is def a learning curve.	20210222T190433

thatthingthathiiing	CJ Instagram - Comments Disabled	10	0	I just found this sub & am going into a minor rabbit hole after learning about the plagiarism. I know, I must have been under a rock. Along the way, I think, ok let me check out their IG account. Comments have been disabled. We all know people tend to do this when negative feedback, hate, and bullying are being posted. So I scroll through the comments and see nothing but fan comments. Seems suspicious? Maybe they’re deleting criticism? If so, there’s another nail in the coffin on them for me. Bullying, racism, and other hate speech shouldn’t be allowed and I understand deleting that. But if they’re receiving FAIR criticism and removing it, but keeping all the comments that say, “hey how can I join the fan club and give you more money on a higher tier??!!” That’s just gross and, to me, unethical.	20210221T024145

cali_girl815	Holly Bartlett case - HOW did she get so lost?!	25	0	I cannot wrap my head around this case. The police think she got so disoriented she ended up under the bridge but I just cannot see that happening, even if she got out the wrong side of the car. I saw the video they posted of the geography of the area and her driveway slopes downward toward the street. If she had gotten out and started walking the wrong direction she would have realized within 10 seconds because she would have been walking downhill. Plus if she had been walking for a minute and still hadn't hit her front door she would have realized she was walking the wrong way and turned around, not keep walking forward and then eventually turn right onto a street?! HOW could she have gotten so disoriented?! I just can't buy the theory that she got so turned around IN HER OWN DRIVEWAY that she wondered .25 miles away even though she was blind and drunk. This is an area she had lived for a while and probably knew how many steps it was to her front door. My theory: She had to have been running from someone or something that night, (most likely the cab driver) and fell and THAT'S how she got disoriented, by running from an attacker. I think her cane was planted there after she was found (to make it look more like an accident and less like foul play) and that's why the police didn't find it initially. So essentially I agree with the theory the PI came up with. What do you guys think???	20210217T061916

Asinapi1	Fireball Episodes	1	0	Not sure if this was previously mentioned, if it was, I'm sorry. Someone or somehow, there needs to be accounts for women who actually left with the guy/guys and can tell the tale of a one night stand, etc.. I know it might be embarrassing, but this would clear up whether this is a trafficking/sinister type situation or just a sleazy pick up tactic. Has anyone who has fallen for this lived to tell the tale? Also, has any of the girls/victims reappeared to any staff that might have witnessed this activity? From my experience working in bars, we do see a lot of regulars. However, we are also, very aware of creepers or bad vibe patrons. Has there been bar staff responding to this story or are we just to hear from close call victims? This story really pisses me off and I want to get to the bottom of it.	20210216T170821

FickleCabbage	BWBRSA: Operation Fireball 2.0 Discussion	1	0	I liked this episode, thought it was cool they did a follow up on a past episode after they got lots of write ins. I had skipped the original episode when it came out because I didn’t understand the acronym(I actually still don’t but if you do please lmk haha) but I listened to it today before this episode. It’s disturbing that there are similar scenarios of this happening throughout the United States. Definitely seems like a human trafficking scheme to me. I wish they would have looked in to missing person records for that area in that time frame because women were consistently leaving with the guy at the bar before the bartender and waitress really caught on. Also shoutout to the waitress and bartender for stepping in and warning Jezz(?)! Any other thoughts or opinions people have on this episode?	20210216T002541
Gai_InKognito	Fireball 2.0 & Web of Lies Connection	1	0	"I only recently heard Fireball 2.0, I havent heard the first. But the story they told was VERY similar to an episode of Web of Lies S4E1 ""People You May Know"". While the location differs, the modus operand sounds similar/nearly the same. Basically creatinga fake profile online to meet someone, but that person doesnt exist, and its really a trap to lure the woman out of her comfort zone, have her spirit broken from being stood up, then being 'accepted' by someone else. And when I uber'ed (MAYBE MONTHS BACK), I would hear this same story of a girl being stood up then approached by some other dude. My guess its a tactic shared among people as a way to lure women (probably men too) out to make them vulnerable to attacks in general. Whether it be kidnapped, assaulted, robbed, etc. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/ur9e0x5q6qh61.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5ce4f2d29e07ded99102626d98acd971778656ee"	20210215T232947

lambie12	LISTEN, AGAIN, SUPER, APPARENTLY, BTW	12	0	I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again with the hopes ashley or Brit see this.... I really like their show and think it is popular for good reason but it could be so much better without the overuse of the words listed in the subject line. The repetitive use of these words is contrived, excessive, and adds absolutely nothing to the podcast. Telling me to listen when I’m already listening is redundant and annoying. Most recently, in this episode when she said BTW instead of by the way when it’s the same number of syllables-reminds me of the curb episode where Larry has to tell a lady she sounds ridiculous for saying LOL when she could just laugh. The fix is easy and the podcast would be much more bearable on the ears.	20210209T152050

Like, Britt talks about growing up in a super small rural town, on a farm, and brings this up frequently, but Ashley doesn’t ever seem to mention going to Britt’s farm as a kid, or talk about living in a small town. Then on a recent episode I listened to, I remember Ashley asking Britt a question along the lines of, “Did your high school have...?” And it confused me because I assumed they went to the same high school. Has anyone else picked up on this?	20210122T190046

anonymous	The self-promo during a story	1	0	The Michaela Garetch episode...Ashley took advantage of a development in a victim’s story to plug her new podcast...She admitted it had “nothing to do with the story” but proceeded. I’ve read people saying the quality of CJ declined and blaming it mostly on Ashley giving less to this podcast. Maybe, that’s exactly it... For me, it’s also that she said at the top of the episode (and throughout the history of the pod) that they would cover cases that didn’t receive attention and so needed the most attention. Here she is taking away what she promised she’d give. To be clear, my problem isn’t the self-promotion during an episode. It’s that she interrupted Michaela in favor of herself. She couldn’t have bookended it either before or after? I thought it was disrespectful. Before anybody tells me to stop listening and/or complaining, I like the podcast. I will continue to listen. A critique isn’t a threat. Many of them recently helped improve the dynamic between Ashley and Britt recently. I hope they continue to get better.	20210118T214057

Dalewin	Props to Crime Junkie regarding banter	205	0	Ashley and Britt do a great job infusing personality into the podcasts without going overboard on the unnecessary banter. They take the nature of the cases seriously without making the show a downer. I'm just realizing this as I'm relistening to the old episodes. I think there's a benefit in having two hosts because they can play off each other.	20210117T070222

I remember listening to an episode about a mother who goes missing but the key point in this case is that HER GLASSES WERE BY HER BED and everyone said she was basically blind without them.. so they said she wouldn’t of gone anywhere without putting her glasses on and wouldn’t of even answered the door without them.. Anyone have any idea of what I’m talking about?👀🙈	20210116T222219

Do I have to pay a monthly patreon and monthly CJ fee? Is the CJ fee like an add on to the patreon membership or am I only paying one fee? Do I sign up on the CJ website and I’m good to go or do I need to sign up with patreon? Edit: Lmao. I just read this post back. I feel like my mother when she says “the Facebook”.	20201230T161427

akayep	Join me on a re-listen! Ep. 5: Robert Fisher	26	0	Crime Junkie Podcast was my first introduction to true crime. Of course I had heard of the high profile cases, but I was never interested in researching them until I discovered Crime Junkie. Listening to this episode again makes me wonder why I have never heard about this case since I first listened to it 2 years ago. The family annihilator cases are the cases that really get to me. I will never understand what makes a parent murder their entire family. This case has so many similarities to the Chris Watts case, which happened in my area and I have heavily followed. Robert made some strange choices after the murders. First, the $280 he took out of the ATM. $280 is such an oddly specific amount to take out. It is not enough money to run away and start a whole new life, which makes me think that was never his plan. Then, he takes his dog with him only to abandon him. (I wonder if family annihilators often let the dog live. I am going to put some research into that.) My opinion is that Robert is guilty. I believe he snapped and killed his family, then tried to cover his tracks by blowing the house up. I believe that all of his actions following the murders were done in haste, without much thought. I believe he then committed suicide. While the alleged sightings of him are definitely interesting and sensational, I just don't think it is that easy to run away and create a new life for yourself. Especially without any preparation beforehand. I have to say though, if I were on a jury for his trial and the only evidence I had was the circumstantial evidence that was presented on this podcast, I would not be able to find him guilty. I do have a small small bit of doubt in my mind.	20201228T210117

akayep	Join me on a re-listen! Ep. 4: The West Mesa Serial Killer	23	0	First off, I had a hard time finding Crime Junkie in my Spotify podcasts because of that dumb new logo (sorry not sorry.) When I finally found them and started listening to the episode I immediately noticed that distracting background music. If I had never listened to CJ and started at the beginning, the background music would be enough for me to turn it off and never listen again. The beginning of the episode is devoted to one of the victims, Michelle. Ash and Brit really gave Michelle's family a hard time for waiting 5 months before reporting her missing and I absolutely disagree with them. I have an extended family member who is homeless and suffering with addiction. Even though she lives in the same town as we do, it is not uncommon to go months without hearing from her. I thought it was way too harsh of Ash and Brit to pass that judgment on the victims family. The detective that connected these missing women together, Ida, is a true angel and I would LOVE to hear her be interviewed to learn exactly how she found the connections. And the dog that found the remains is also a hero in this case (notice I referred to him as a DOG and not a pruppet, because pruppet is the most cringe worthy word I have ever heard.) I feel like they either glossed over the suspects, or I got distracted by that stupid background music and zoned out while they were talking about them. I do not think I have enough information to form an opinion on who could be the murderer. The only strong opinion I have is that there is probably another burial ground that has yet to be found. I would love to hear everyone's opinions on this case! *I apologize if my synopsis seems negative or snarky today. I admit I am emotionally struggling this holiday season and I might have a bit of a bad attitude as a result.*	20201221T031156
anonymous	The amount of side podcasts that Ashley Flowers does is starting to get ridiculous	174	0	"I feel like every time that I’m listening to this podcast, Ashley yet again has some new side podcast. The majority of them are temporary, so I really don’t understand why she just doesn’t turn this into a normal episode with several parts, spread out over a period of time. I’ve just noticed that I’m starting to get really irritated and even turn off the podcast when she does another announcement. Maybe if she focused more on one project, she wouldn’t have to worry about things like plagiarism and working on improving or fixing their reputation. [Edit] Listen y'all, don't feel bad for me. I'm not personally ""hurt"" by some people behaving like idiots. I expect this from the internet and I can assure you that I'm not bothered. I love having discussions with people. Life is boring when everyone agrees with everyone. If people wanna get upset, that's their right. But I also have the right to voice my own opinion. Which I will continue to do regardless of how anyone else feels."	20201220T220756

_heidster	Faith Hedgepeth - 911 Call Analysis	96	0	"First off, I'm new to this sub. I am very into true crime, but I stopped listening when the plagariasm scandal broke, and just recently (last Friday) started listening again. I'm binging it hard, and today I am on the Faith Hedgepeth story. As has been discussed several times on this sub, 911 calls grate on me because everyone single one is ""how suspicious..."". The 911 Call, Brit and Ashley discuss how Faith's roommate cannot remember her address and think that she (Karina) overuses the excuse that she just moved there. I semi-moved in with my Fiancé during the lock-down, and officially canceled my apartment lease and moved in with him a few months ago. I still sometimes have to confirm the address with him when I am ordering things online. I don't think that 5 months is an awful long time for someone to have to memorize their address; especially to a point they can rattle it off without stuttering under extremely stressful/emotional situations. But that point aside I want to discuss their accusations that Karina stressed too much the fact that she just arrived at home. I have worked on the National Suicide Hotline and one of the first things we learn is to gently ask questions, but do not come across as overbearing. After listening to the 911 call I thought that Karina was simply trying to explain she just got home, she did not want to touch the body, and she just needed help. I don't think that shutting down the dispatcher by continuing to tell her those 3 facts was due to her being guilty, but simply because that are the 3 things that kept running through her head. She knew if the dispatcher continued asking questions she would not know any of them. This podcast makes me terrified to ever call 911 if I have an emergency because people overanalyze the smallest hitch in the voice, using the wrong words (according to an internet blog), etc... it's not that deep! Emotions and panic affect everyone differently. Thoughts?"	20201217T203252

akayep	Join me on a re-listen! Eps. 2&3: Laci Peterson	32	0	This week I decided to do both episodes of the Laci Peterson case. I just figured it was best to talk about the case as a whole. Ash and Brit seem much more relaxed in these episodes than the first. Ash's storytelling (the reason I fell in love with the podcast) is on point in these episodes. The background music is still there though, and is distracting. I hope they get rid of it early on! This is one of the most high profile cases that was heavily covered in the media, yet for some reason I have never really researched the case. All I knew was that Scott killed his wife Laci, and somehow there was a mistress named Amber Frey involved. The only details I know now is what is covered in these 2 episodes. That being said, I agree with Ashley that Scott is innocent. He is a shitty husband and a shitty person, but I don't believe he killed his wife. The one point that really convinced me he is innocent is the fact that Laci was using the computer at 8:30am the morning of her disappearance. If Scott had killed her, she would have been dead by then. That Amber Frey though is a piece of work. The audio clips they played of her and her fake baby voice was so cringeworthy. Im not saying she had anything to do with it or that she was ever really in the wrong, but I just don't like her lol. I would LOVE if any of you could relisten to these episodes and tell me your thoughts. I would also love to hear any additional details that weren't covered in the podcast that may have swayed your own opinions on this case.	20201214T223606

crimeglassespodcst	Crime Junkie: Operation Fireball - My THEORY perpetrator was a Pick Up Artist	2	0	"So, Crime Junkie recently posted a bonus episode (sort of in collaboration with Something Was Wrong). Here is a summary of the case, but feel free to scroll below for my theory. **Spoilers** Below: The episode talks about how a young woman named Jez recently moved to Denver. She was looking to meet new people and joined an online dating platform. She comes across this guy named Jordan and they are a match! They start talking using the online platform and decide they want to meet in person. They set-up a plan to meet a local bar and move their conversation to text messages. When Jez makes it to the bar, Jordan tells her that he will be running late and to order two fireball shots. When she does, a man who was already sitting at the bar starts to make conversation with her. At this point, Jordan texts her and says that he will not make it. She calls the number he texts her from but the number appears to be disconnected (or as if it never existed). She thinks this is strange but decides to stay and buy herself dinner. The man at the bar says he feels bad for her and insists on paying for her dinner, but she declines. At this point, Jez goes to the bathroom and the waitress follows her. The waitress explains that she has witnessed the man sitting at the bar (the one who asked to pay for the dinner) do this ""routine"" a few times before. A woman arrives at the bar, orders two shots of fireball and she gets stood up. At which point, the man at the bar is there to cheer them up, buy them dinner & the women always end up leaving with the man. Ashley Flowers mentions that she thinks this could be a human trafficking scheme, which made me cringe a little. As we learn more about human trafficking, we know that it mainly happens through coercion and grooming. SO HERE IS **MY THEORY**: A few years ago, I read about the Gable Tostee & how he read the book the Game. The Game is a book written by Neil Strauss that details ways to pick up women & I was so curious... I read it. Yup, I think this was a **Pick Up Artist,** yes I cringed while writing that. Here's why: it's a way for him to be a shoulder to cry on, for women to see him as ""the good guy."" It's important to point out that most pick-up artists are not interested in a relationship, which is why he has done this a couple of times. Also, it is known that the man at the bar possibly used an alias - also common with PUA. Neil Strauss used to go by ""Styles."" Thoughts? Did you listen to this episode?"	20201213T221158

yayornae92	Crime Cruise	12	0	Is anyone planning on attending the crime cruise 2021? I just heard about it, and truly could say I’ve never on my life been interested in going on a cruise until I found out about this. Dream cruise! I’d like to go, but I don’t have any other crime junkie friends. Would it be weird to go alone/if you’ve been, is it easy to meet people and make friends?	20201207T100207
lizzie_bee_	Better Help ads	27	0	I’ve noticed that Crime Junkie episodes have a lot of ads for better help counseling, which is an extremely problematic company. Therapists on this app have ghosted their patients, charged patients for sessions that never happened, and using “therapists” that aren’t licensed.	20201207T002035
akayep	Join me on a re-listen! Ep. 1: Niqui McCown	86	0	I have decided to re-listen to one episode a week, starting at the beginning, and start a discussion here on each episode. I would love if some of you would join me! First of all, it is clear in this first episode that Ash and Brit have not gotten their groove yet lol. The flow of the story is not great, the background music is distracting, and it is overall hard to follow along. However, it is also clear the excitement and passion in Ash and Brits voices, which I am missing lately. And Brits lines do not feel as scripted as they do now. Now to talk about the case. I firmly believe Tommy is guilty. He has a personal connection to Niqui since he was dating her sister. He has proven that he is capable of killing when he killed his ex girlfriend, Tina. His motive, though, is unclear to me. One interesting point was that her car was found months later in the parking lot of the apartment complex of her ex boyfriend. The ex boyfriend was ruled out, but I think whoever put the car there knew exactly what they were doing. They knew that her ex lived there, and they wanted to lead law enforcement to him to take the blame off themselves.	20201206T215327

I have only listen to 3-4 so far but it seems like Brit has more, less scripted lines. Am I imagining that? As a side note, I’ve had a hard time telling if the free episodes are getting more/less scripted because I listen to all of them out of order. I tend to go serial killers, murdered, conspiracy, missing, as well as pushing child murders until the very end because they bother me much more than the others.	20201204T161651

JarlShitpost	Episode BWBRSA: Operation Fireball	174	0	Just listened to the most recent episode, and it really sketched me out. I think Ashley's assessment at the end is very accurate. Denver is a major trafficking hub, and while it may have been a guy working alone to take advantage of women, it felt darker than that. Has anyone else ever heard stories or had experiences like the one described in the episode? Do you agree with Ashley that if was most likely a trafficking scheme?	20201204T131441

flowersforfrogs	Ashley has so many shows	110	0	Listen, I don’t want to drag Ashley. I still listen to CJ and Supernatural, and other then what’s been said around this sub, I really don’t have anything negative to say about them. But that’s what I want to talk about. Ashley has so many shows now, and CJ is sort of going down. It’s not terrible, but certainly a lot of people have annoyances with it. Why not focus on one or two podcasts and really put a lot of effort into them, rather then have many podcasts and spend little time on them? I don’t know how much time she actually spends on anything, so I do not want to be rude and just assume. But it’s just something I’ve been thinking about. Edit: I understand she wants to make more money. And I don’t blame her at all. It makes sense that she would branch out. It just seems weird to me for someone to create a podcast for something they’re interested in, only to then continue making podcasts to the point where they cannot spend a lot of effort/time on their original interest podcast. Like I said, I don’t know how much effort/time she’s actually putting into any of her podcasts, I don’t mean to be rude. It’s possible that she’s genuinely putting a lot of effort into them, and good for her. I still love CJ and Supernatural as well as Ashley/Brit. This is just something that I’ve been noticing.	20201202T003247

the_ashley_wilson	Constructive Criticism	12	0	"This post is in hopes that everyone in this subreddit can take some constructive criticism since many are so willing to dish it out... I joined this subreddit as a way to connect with other listeners when I listened to this podcast. It was my understanding this was a place to voice questions, concerns, and comments that were not always positive, as it was not something being condoned on the official Facebook account or groups. What I found is this place is no better. There is constant gatekeeping of what criticisms are supported with a non-stop barrage of ""Well, don't listen."" If someone posts an opinion more than once, they're ridiculed for it and, once again, told to not listen. I'm sure I'm not the first to point out you all have become the EXACT thing you ran from. I actually don't listen to the podcast anymore due to my lack of interest in their format and liking others more. However, I genuinely feel bad for people who thought they found a safe place and stumbled into this mess. I don't care if you do better. You may not care, and I'm sure the hate I get from this will be intense. But please keep in mind you're going to be speaking into an abyss soon because you will make others run from you as well."	20201129T060916

I am currently listening to “wanted: a Christmas killer” from last year. I thought the case was super interesting and decided to google it. The suspect in the case that they talked about towards the end, actually got indicted for the murder last month.

I appreciate people pointing out things that CJ might have done wrong that I may have not noticed. And then there are those posts complaining about how there's too much criticism! So maybe instead of complaining, I thought I would make a post where we can put in some positive stuff instead of just remarking about how there isn't any. So what do you love about CJ in general, or things that you love that set it apart from other crime podcasts that you have tried?	20201125T215518

laurenashley7774	Leigh Occhi	39	0	This case is heartbreaking. I had read about it before when I first got into true crime but it was nice to get a deeper look. I would put this case up there with Kaitlyn Akins and Bryce Laspisa. My thoughts: 1) I live in coastal SC so I know hurricanes. What people don’t realize is that robberies tend to increase during a hurricane. Lots of people evacuate, less people on the roads, harder for LE to get to you.... Even though I don’t think that’s what happened here it’s something to consider. 2) I’m pretty jaded and I’m always one to think the parents or spouse had something to do with it. The mom is shady to me. Even if you forget the polygraphs bc I don’t trust them anyways. She leaves at 8 but is back at 9 due to one missed phone call. Wouldn’t it have made sense to have the grandparents go to her instead of leaving work? And the allegations of abuse don’t make things look good. Also, what are the chances the very first time Leigh is left alone she’s murdered? 3) the Sunday school teacher is crazy but I honestly don’t think he did it. Maybe I missed this but how would he have known Leigh was alone at that time of day. Plus, why would he kill one girl yet just drop another off at school? Definitely suspicious though. What are the chances of her going missing and knowing someone is a rapist? My theory, Leigh was murdered the night before during a fight with her mom. Maybe the murder was an accident bc the mom lost her cool. To cover it up, she stages the scene and goes to work. Leaves due to the phone not being answered and finds the scene. Calls police. I go back and forth with this case but this is the scenario I keep coming back to consider. What’s your thoughts?	20201118T122141

illszn	Amy Lynn Bradley	20	0	Yesterday I was unsure about what my favorite case was, but I think I found the one! This case is bizarre. After listening to these cases everyday since I first discovered the podcast. I have became extra paranoid with what goes on around me. For example, my gf wanted to go to California ALONE just to visit her aunt for a week. We live a few states away so it would be a long trip. She is a very attractive 19yo college student so after hearing many cases especially Rachel Cooke’s. Not sure if this is good or bad, but I definitely do not want to lose the love of my life to some maniac. Edit: I apologize for thinking location services aren’t good enough for me being so far away from my future wife. Like I commented below I showed her this post including the comments and she laughed and said I’m not even controlling. With a rough upbringing I’m not used to my loved ones flying across the country alone to visit people especially in bigger states than the one we reside in. p.s. I never told her “you can’t go” or “sharing location isn’t good enough”, it’s just an opinion of mine.	20201117T160252

She held a birthday party the following week at her sons funeral after a 2 hour vigil and based off of her reaction of the party, police believed it was her who committed the crime. She’s been in prison for the past 20 years. Here’s what I think happened. I believe her husband Darin, came down stairs dressed in all black while they were sleeping, killed the kid’s, and tried killing Darlie. She claims to have seen a man in the household when she woke up. Maybe that man was Darin running upstairs to take off his shirt, because I heard somewhere he was only wearing jeans when he came downstairs. So she screams after seeing her kids bodies and hears glass break in the kitchen, maybe that was him bumping into the glass or possibly Darin throwing the glass to drag her attention towards the weapon and or away from the scene all while he runs across the street to inform the nurse neighbor of the horrific crime going on. What if when he went to grab the neighbor he was really just throwing away the outfit he had just committed the crimes in? Because for no reason whatsoever police found a sock by their mailbox with both of their kids blood on it. Darin claims to have went outside for the nurse, when in reality he was disposing evidence and accidentally dropped the sock? In multiple interviews he claims to have heard glass break first, and in some cases the screams first. Also he doesn’t seem to show any remorse ever. He’s probably lowkey gave police the idea that maybe his wife did it, after he realized his attack on her was unsuccessful. She’s been in prison for 24 years now. I can’t imagine how that must be for her mentally. Apparently they have bloody prints waiting to get new and improved DNA testing done on, but there has been no updates since that was announced. Do you think Darlie Router killed her kids? Edit: typos TL;DR: I think Darin tried to kill his whole family, as he’s cleaning up Darlie wakes up and starts screaming that’s when he runs away knocking over the glass, setting down the knife and hops out the window, runs across the street without knowing he dropped his sock and lowkey disposes the evidence down the sewage drain. Runs back to his distraught wife, who’s in defense mode. That’s when police arrive. Maybe he made a comment or two about her story or whatever trying to get eyes on her. Which would later result in her going to prison for her sons murders.	20201112T003412

Rinkydinkmcgoo	The way Ashley pronounces “horror”	18	0	I’m currently listening to the fan club episode, Jeanine Nicarico. At about 31:15, Ashley says “an all too familiar horror is about to unfold.” I SWEAR she said whore. I’ve noticed her pronouncing it as whore in the past, but this one just really got me 😂 Also props to Britt for going pretty easy on the “as a parent” thing.

Did you catch that dialogue of Britt (or Ashley since she wrote the script) stumbling to back Ashley (So Ashley defending herself) in the way she pronounced “Terrence”? It was one of the most unconvincing and inelegant things I’ve ever heard. I don’t mind that there is a script but I do mind bad writing and no rhythm. I’m sitting here wondering why Ashley didn’t just say “There are two pronunciations of the name. Here’s why I’m using this one...” I liked it better when she said Jock-Ease (Jacques) LOL It was embarrassing but at least it was honest.	20201102T200422

anonymous	Brit really hit all the micro aggressions this episode	0	0	Edit: You all do realize Hispanic is actually not an appropriate term? If you’re referencing the fact that she’s LatinX to make the argument that she can’t be ignorant, then let me edit it: Brit, with all of her white passing privilege, with an ignorant script written by her white woman friend, consistently makes ignorant comments and her mispronunciation of non-Caucasian names doesn’t help prove otherwise. No for the original post: I’m only about 10 mins in, but there are already two moments that really stick out as being so ignorant they’re mildly racist: 1. Where Brit asks if the main guys name in pronounced wrong (are you correcting the pronunciation of a person’s name?) 2. The recording of the guy who said his brother killed and dumped the body was pretty clear, but Brit, in her true white girl self, asks if it was fuzzy? Idk.. I like the stories but I really can’t stand Brit and today hasn’t made it any better. (And also, if you’re a person saying the that consistently mispronouncing a name isn’t a big deal, I want you to take a second and honestly ask yourself why you don’t think it’s a big deal, and then ask yourself why it might be a big deal for someone else. To be clear, the answer probably isn’t that you’re more or less rational than the other person.)	20201102T125335

reporteramber	Crimes of the Centuries	27	0	I checked the rules and didn’t see this listed as a no-no but don’t flog me if I’m wrong. I host Accused (investigative podcast examining old cases). I’ve got a new podcast that I started recording after the pandemic began and I found myself suddenly immersed in all things history. (I think it started with 1918 Spanish Flu research.) Anyway, my new thing launched this week from the Obsessed Network. It’s called [Crimes of the Centuries](http://www.centuriespod.com). The goal is to mix my research with expert interviews (journalists, historians, etc) and examine not just the case, but the way the case affected society. It’s been a lot of fun and I *think* most Crime Junkie fans would generally like it, too. I’m hopping all over the timeline, from the country’s first recorded murder trial in 1800 to a serial killer who changed state law in 1988. Anyway, if this sounds like your thing, I’d appreciate any support! Thanks so much!	20201029T013827

DeificWhiteBoy	So Many Themes in this Podcast are Getting Old and Annoying	187	0	I’ve been listening to this podcast for years and it’s always been one of my favorites. It was literally THE podcast that got me into podcasts. However, some of the themes within it are getting so played out and repetitive that it’s becoming almost unlistenable to me: 1. Every piece of dialogue Britt adds to the podcast feels so forced and obvious. You can tell it’s scripted, or at the very least, she was given talking points before the podcast started. They’ll talk about a red truck literally just five minutes ago and then Britt alwayssss has to go, “But wait? Didn’t you say something about a red truck earlier?”. No shit, Britt. We have attention spans longer than goldfish. We know she mentioned a red truck earlier. 2. Britt. Having. To. Pause. After. Every. Word. 3. Them diving into the statement analysis blog is the worst thing to ever happen to the show and the biggest detractor for me now. The stuff mentioned in there makes almost no sense whatsoever. Every single episode they say, “Well you never know how you’ll react in the moment,” but then they try to nitpick the smallest words of the people on 911 calls. One theme regarding this that aggravates me the most is when they think it’s suspicious that people don’t say the victim’s name when calling 911. Why would you ever refer to someone by their first name if you’re talking to a stranger. That 911 operator doesn’t have a clue who “Bill” is nor do they care. I always just say “my friend” or something similar if I’m talking to someone who doesn’t know them.	20201027T234423

But nevertheless, there were stories from the first season that I still think about today, and I was excited for season 2. I don’t mind that Ashley took a different creative route with the podcast, but the stories just seemed... less interesting? Worms is the only story that really gave me chills, but I found myself loosing interest as the season went on and started tuning in and out. Especially the one about the Professor in episode 11. Also I get Ashley wants to make more money, but to put the rest of the episodes on an entirely different site that we have to sign up for makes me not want to hear the rest of the stories. Basically, I was hoping for some more interesting stories in season 2 but none of them were really good.	20201021T134039

It was so sad to listen to her break down while talking to the operator. I believe the points they made against her based on that call were too picky- she was obviously very distressed in my opinion. When I’m looking at the facts of the case I feel like it must have been a random attack due to the unlocked door and the fact that the DNA evidence does not match with any of the main suspects. Karena and Faith were out together as friends that night- I don’t feel like Karena could have had anything to do with the murder. What do you all think?	20201015T234052

mrsscorsese	Anatomy of Murder	35	0	Audio Chuck announced their new show today: Anatomy of Murder. First two episodes are already out. A look into murder cases layer by layer: the victim, crime, and the investigation. Ashley and Brit do not host. Scott, an investigative journalist and former deputy sheriff and Anna-Sigga, a former NYC homocide prosecutor host the show. I just finished the first episode and definitely enjoyed it. They had the daughter of the victim speak as well, which was nice. It overall seems like a pretty basic crime show episode, except for Anna-Sigga answering a lot of questions and explaining the process behind what can go into an investigation or overall potential conviction. My only complaint is that it would be nice to hear Scott speak more. He has a nice voice, and i'm sure is very knowledgeable in his own right. Curious to hear what you guys think!

Reagans_Ruler	The difference between “jail” and “prison” and why Ashley and Brit need to learn the difference...	147	0	Murdered: Shaquita Bennett was the first episode where it irritated me how they do not know the difference. They use jail and prison interchangeably. You cannot post bond to get out of prison; that’s jail. So when they say her killer “posted $5k bail and got out of prison”, that is grossly incorrect. Prison is a sentence handed down from a judge or jury. Might not seem like a big deal but it’s a constant inaccuracy on an almost monthly basis. You would think after all the seasons of this great podcast they would have learned the difference and system by now.	20201007T192739

sjbeeks	CounterClock Season 2	5	0	I don’t know if anyone has given Counterclock season 2 a try, since I know season 1 wasn’t super well received by this sub, but I would actually give it a listen if you haven’t already! It’s already way less repetitive and more engaging than s1, even though I think it’s only about halfway through. I had a really hard time getting through last season, I felt like the whole thing could have been done in like 3 episodes. The story seemed to go in circles and not really have a clear direction. This season seems to have much better pacing and story telling so far, and the case is a *lot* more compelling than the last one imo. Has anyone else given it a try?

I'm halfway through their OJ Simpson trial episodes and have listen to a few stand alone ones as well. The hosts are really palatable and they have a nice chemistry. It has good storytelling like Crime Junkie and the snark of Morbid (but with a tad more maturity and less cursing). Best of all is not a lot of banter on either end of the episodes.	20201001T162048

acornedbeefhash	I’m curious if anyone else feels this way	1	0	I’ve noticed they’ve been ending the podcasts on tip number lines to call and Ashley saying “if you have ANY information about xyz call....” and I just cannot help but think WHYY?? Do criminals involved in crimes listen to crime podcasts? If I knew something about this 30 year cold case wouldn’t I have already been interviewed?? It just drives me crazy that they put this at the end. I just cannot imagine a scenario where someone who knows something about a decades old crime happens to be listening to a crime podcast about that crime and it joggs their memory. Maybe it’s just me over generalizing but surely the certain type person that listens to these podcasts aren’t the ones involved. I mean... maybe MAYBE it could in theory happen but it just REALLY irks me that they put this call out for more information to their fans. I’m curious what other CJ fans think about this. EDIT: I just want to add, I have no problem at all with tip number lines being included in their sources and information on the website about the episode. It’s totally great to have that accessible, I just don’t like it in the actual recorded episode.	20200929T134330
stateofgracethirteen	My confession about the podcast	398	0	I have never, not once, ever in my life listened to the Pruppet of The Month segment. I literally hear them say it’s coming up on the episodes and I just skip to the next episode lol. I absolutely adore dogs and have a beautiful rescue myself but for some reason I have no interest in listening to it?! I can’t even explain it, I just have zero care for that part of the show. And I know the Pruppet term is some sort of inside joke with them but I feel awkward when they say it Is it worth it to listen to the next one I hear? Who has enjoyed them and has any favorite stories?	20200929T040628

Gloober_5	Why cry about dogs but not humans	29	0	I totally understand why the death and pain of dogs in the Pruppet or the Month segments are so sad, but I find it really strange that Brit and Ashley are so incredibly emotional over the sorrows of the dogs and yet show barely any emotion over the tragic deaths of humans. To an extent I get it- like they are trying to be formal in their main podcast and then they can be more of themselves in the after segment. But I find it weird and kind of unsettling.	20200929T002141

dhtchk	Ashley & Brit...	74	0	..are a great combo. What makes CJ unique are two things: 1. Ashley has a strong story telling capability (despite some grammar lapses). She's able to convey interest and compassion. 2. The Ashley/Brit combo allows Ashley to tell the story to someone. My guess is that Britt does not know the details of the story until it is being revealed by Ashley. This makes Ashley's story telling way more intimate and empassioned than if she were speaking to a web void. It is a unique approach that do e set bog down into uninteresting banter or conversation that happens on a lot of other crime podcasts do. Bottom line: Ashley and Britt both play key roles!	20200928T182940
b6bygirl	New fan	14	0	I’ve listened to about 8 podcasts so far, but the more I listen I’m noticing Ashley seems very stuck in her ways when it comes to her opinions on the crimes. Britt will try to be more optimistic, offering other possibilities, and Ashley will just shut her down or go “I guess that makes sense.” This is kind of a turn off to me and I’m wondering if anyone else has noticed it?	20200928T175400
25277177	Recommendations please	34	0	I like CJ....I really do. I think Ashley is a great story teller and I love that they do a great variety of crimes, not just the ones you see on TV. BUT I CANNOT STAND BRIT...I was about 50 eps in and I had enough. So with that said, any recommendations on other podcasts that are similar to CJ but without an annoying person in the background giving fake exaggerated reactions every 5 mins? A podcast that has great story tellers, do well on research and some great humor will be a bonus. I love MFM (mostly for their humor), I tried True Crime Garage, Morbid but just couldn't really get into them.	20200927T165142

Specifically was so confused in the latest episode, The Butcher Baker of Alaska... they said the 17 year old sex worker in the beginning of the story did a rape kit which found semen... but they never addressed the semen sample?

anonymous	Why cover Ed Kemper?	76	0	I’m wondering why Ashley chose to cover Ed Kemper this episode, since there are so many other podcasts (much longer episodes, too), documentaries, books, and articles about him. I know they’ve done episodes on a few well known serial killers before, but I’m curious as to why they chose Ed because I feel like true crime media is really saturated with stories on him. Also, it’s crazy crazy crazy to me that there is so much info about his life and Ashley STILL pronounced ‘Atascadero’ incorrectly. Edit: adding - For anyone assuming that I’m just finding something to “complain” about, I’m not going to respond. There is plenty that I like about Crime Junkie, and I discuss those things on this forum often. But an extremely condensed version of a *very* “prolific” serial killer doesn’t really cut it for me. If they had done a “Murders in Santa Cruz” episode which would cover victims of Mullins, Kemper, and others, that would be a slightly more original take. Edit: adding more context - I guess more of my point is the fact that this case has been covered so thoroughly in the past, but this CJ episode doesn’t get very thorough at all. It feels more like Ashley took from a small handful of the massive information available about Kemper and quickly threw it together to get an episode out.	20200817T171227

anonymous	Martha Moxley killer theories	26	0	Holy moly what a wild case. I felt like I suspected Ken, Michael, and Timothy all at different times. I kinda agree with the defense - the case against Michael felt extremely circumstantial. Coupled with the fact that I *just* finished The Lost Kids (great podcast about abusive behavioral “therapy” boot camps), I can really see how he could have been forced into saying he murdered Martha. I also want to know *what* Michaels book proposal was about. Maybe Ashley mentioned this and I missed it, but was it supposed to be fictional? Inspired by true events? An actual memoir? It seems wild to me that you would write a book proposal admitting to a murder you got away with and then list it as non-fiction. I get that the family is well-connected and wealthy so they might get by with local police but I don’t think that would quell any outrage from the public. But then again, it’s so wild that he was convicted then not then convicted again and then... not... so, what do I know! What do y’all think?	20200811T044733

conleeomg	Is the name of this podcast offensive?	21	0	I’m trying to gather some information on what people who listen to the podcast (or don’t) think about this. I’ll start by giving my thoughts: The term “junkie” is largely viewed as a derogatory term for people who suffer from addiction. There could be an argument that it’s a figure of speech, but it wouldn’t explain why the graphic for the podcast name shows pills spelling out the word JUNKIE. It also doesn’t help that the language the hosts use during the podcast and on their website include charged phrases such as “get your fix” and “Hi, I’m ____ and I’m a junkie.” Anyway, I wanted to know what people thought about this or if it’s already been discussed, especially in the light of an opioid epidemic, it seems at least to me that this sort of messaging minimizes a struggle that millions of people face.	20200806T151856

The maintenance man (who found me), the property manager, and I still don’t know how I was able to lift the lid off to get in since it’s so heavy. It seems like you can become very limber when you’re unconscious or impaired. People do wild things on Ambien. My friend ordered one of those super expensive exercise mirrors when she was on it. All this being said, the dismissal by police and assumption it was a suicide are really messed up. It really upsets me when people are so quick to believe a person will commit suicide just because they are depressed. And then what happened to Bailee? Smells like a coverup.	20200727T222318

GypsyFR	Questions on Angie Barlow	0	0	I posted this in unsolved mysteries reddit too Hi I listen to a few Angie Barlow podcasts and what doesn’t make any sense is where her body was found it’s being reported baron’s family lived there once, however I can’t find the source of that info. Crime Junkie says ID channel said it, I did find the video but no source to where this info was found. They just say it and move right along with the story. ID doesn’t even mention it in the article about the case. Also her mom told Indy justice she kept getting prank calls, fake tips and ransom demands, but believe raven really called her. That doesn’t make any sense. The cars leaving together, I don’t really see it as sinister as everyone is making it. For example: me and sister have left together simultaneously and went other places. If we remove the phone call and the location where the body was found then I don’t think we have anything. I honestly believe that’s why the police didn’t arrest them. Also I’ve been looking this up for weeks and outside of the ID doc, it’s not mentioned anywhere that the home where her body was found was previously rent by his family. It was an Active serial killer, killing dancers during this time. Raven could have killed her but I’m not so sure anymore.

BillMurraysAscot	What other true crime shows do you listen to?	45	0	I’m looking for new shows to get into to keep up with my daily walks (I only listen to podcasts while exercising). I already listen to and love MFM and have listened to most of CJ but am starting to really dislike their newer episodes. I like the storytelling aspect of CJ but Ashley’s personality is really starting to grate me. Also finding that I’m very particular about the show talent so here’s what I’ve tried so far: The First Degree (awful, could not STAND the two girls voices and really really bad storytelling), Murder Squad (giving this more of a shot but not in love, last episode I listened to was very poorly told), Morbid (will also probably keep trying on this one. I did one episode and found the girls kind of bland and monotone), True Crime Obsessed (had to turn it off with all the GIRL! and fake JVN impersonation). Appreciate any recommendations! Anything from 45 min to 1.5 hours is preferred.	20200717T204228
ravenfalls	Can anyone help me remember this episode?	7	0	I had a bout of bad migraines during lockdown and listened to a lot of CJ.

There may have been a part of it where in the past the man was found covered in blood by his wife? I can’t really remember. If this sounds familiar I’d love some help.

I’m down for a good conspiracy theory, but if this many episodes are about government secrets, it should be its own podcast	20200715T170010

They also seem like the type of people who would call the cops on me if I was walking through my neighborhood after they moved in to gentrify it lol. No but really these women aren't interested in actually giving a voice to victims or humanizing them, they are in the business of selling fear. Two midwest Karen's with big egos and poorly researched and exicuted episodes. I literally am baffled that it has 5 out of 5 stars. What the hell is going on?

Propheticpoems	I like the clinical style / lack of banter	97	0	I started listening to the show a few months ago, and quickly became obsessed. I thought it was a little weird that the show was so clinical without banter or much back and forth, but I still liked it quite a bit because all the stories were new to me. Recently I went back to the very beginning during a remodeling project where I has plenty of time for podcasts. These episodes had A LOT of banter, and instead of liking this more casual style more, I now appreciate the current style even more. I like how well prepared and scripted the show is--it feels like not a moment is wasted.	20200713T162805

tribnic	Rey Rivera completed suicide	116	0	I'm a bit disappointed by the team in this episode and think they, as well as Unsolved Mysteries and Mikita Brottman, have set mental health awareness back. I work very closely with leading psychiatric researchers and thought leaders. I didn't hear any psychiatric expertise in this episode or in the research and I think it's desperately needed. So much of the things surrounding Rey in the days and weeks leading up to his death are textbook symptoms of major psychiatric issues, at least as they are presented in the episode, particularly a first episode of psychosis or a severe episode of mania. Rey was around the age that most experience First Episode Psychosis at the time of his death. Those experiencing first episode psychosis or FEP are at incredibly high risk for suicide and there are often no signs. For those experiencing FEP or mania, delusions, perhaps like Rey's Masonic infatuation, are often a predictor. This is especially true of his note -- classic manic or FEP delusion. I'd direct you to the work of Dr. Igor Galynker and/or Dr. Henry Nasrallah and something called suicide crisis syndrome. To me it seems as if his family is grasping at straws, his friend is comittng fraud and doesn't want to deal with police. Also, a handful of cops and investigators want to tell the family what they want to hear. We need to hear from a psychiatrist regarding is risk profile so his family can be at peace or to consider this something other than a suicide. We also need to be aware of the incredible burden and tragedy that patients with psychosis experience and do better discussing it in open ways to change stigmas and increase the chances for a better life for those with the Illness. I wish they'd address this in a future episode. I'm disappointed.	20200629T235600

duckieroo	Old episode about the legitimacy of polygraphs??	17	0	I was listening to the Feb 4, 2018 episode about Amy Weidner (so it’s an old one) and there was a little tid bit where Ashley goes on about how you should never take a polygraph and how they’ve been proven to not be accurate. I just find this so shocking to hear because in recent episodes they always site polygraph results and lean on them in their opinion of the suspects. I was so confused it seemed like she used to have such a different stance.	20200625T190351

anonymous	Why continue listening to a podcast you aren’t enjoying?	261	0	I’ve wanted to post this for a while but held off. This sub has so much hate for the podcast and I honestly don’t get it. I found the podcast a year or so ago and fell in love listening to them because it is so conversational and in a way that I would be with my friends so I can relate. They have opinions - you are never going to please everyone. They need to get paid so have ads - these aren’t always going to suit everyone. They encourage you to stay safe and simply be aware of your surroundings - this can be interpreted differently by everyone, true, but I don’t think they ever intent comments like that to take hold of peoples lives. If you don’t like the podcast then I’m struggling to understand why you post in a sub consistently about how you dislike it and how it makes you feel negative. If it does have that effect on you then please stop listening to it for your own health and maybe not following a sub or posting in a sub about it would help? I’m pretty new to reddit and I started following this to hear opinions about episodes, maybe read the odd rant and get discussions going but I did not follow this sub to read how it makes people feel negative and you’ve stopped listening but decided to share all your negative thoughts about it anyway. Thank you for coming to my ted talk 😂	20200624T193226

anonymous	Black Lives Matter statement vs. support of law enforcement	28	0	Anyone else have a hard time taking CJ’s BLM statement seriously when they have been such ardent supporters of law enforcement in the past? To be fair, I know they call out missteps in investigations by police and the military (who they also support), but just making a “we believe black lives matter” statement + some donations seems kinda.. empty? Not trying to start shit, just wanted to discuss if anyone else felt this way. Edit: I want to clarify that I don’t think that cops are inherently bad. I know that good people go into law enforcement with the hope to do good things. But the way our current justice system operates, that’s just not possible. Police are expected to be therapists, perform welfare checks, interview victims of abuse and rape, relocate the homeless, de escalate violent situations, etc and it’s just not POSSIBLE for one force to do all of this. My blame isnt entirely on cops - it’s the system that was created to have them be the go to response for all things, even ones that aren’t necessarily criminal. And it’s the system that trained them to use more force than necessary, and create an “us against them mentality”. I asked this question because I am interested how they would proceed with their work. As others have mentioned in this sub, their tone has changed. I agree that it has and I found it interesting considering their previous statements in support of law enforcement. George Floyd was obviously not the first or last man to be murdered under custody of police, so I was curious as to whether or not y’all would think their tone would stick.	20200622T170837
RoseGoldTampon	Angie	27	0	There’s no doubt that Raven and Baron killed Angie. 1. Raven “hired” Angie to dance at a party posing as a random client. Angie never would have gone if she’d known it was Raven. 2. Raven had potential motive to kill Angie, supposedly Angie had a thing with her boyfriend/husband Baron. 3. The apartment the party was at was found to belong to Raven and Baron. 4. Raven’s car was seen following Angie’s when she left the party. 5. Angie’s body was found buried under a rental house that Baron’s family had once rented. 6. Raven and Baron immediately moved to Phoenix, Arizona. 7. Raven called Angie’s friend later and asked her “you want to know what her last words are?” I know this is all circumstantial but seriously! There’s no doubt in my mind that they’ve killed her and gotten away with it.	20200622T143709

understandable_76	Why is it that people take responsibility for a crime they did not commit?	1	0	Why is it that people take responsibility for a crime they did not commit? That just doesn’t make sense to me for a number of reasons. The first thing that came to mine was that the police or whoever was investigating them would find no evidence and no leads towards to three criminal and they would just be wasting the police’s time. Another reason is that they can be charged with a different charge I’m assuming, but I’m not too sure about that statement and if you can fact check that I’d greatly appreciate your input. This is truly confusing to me so to anyone who can answer that question it’d be greatly appreciated.	20200621T062443

bookthief8	Is Supernatural with Ashley Flowers negatively affecting anyone else's enjoyment of Crime Junkie?	42	0	"I've been dipping my toe into Supernatural with Ashley Flowers since it's come out, and I feel like it's negatively affected my enjoyment of Crime Junkie. I love how Crime Junkie brings light to cases I've never heard of before. I found Ashley's rabbit hole theories interesting, at least when it comes to true crime. But it's been bothering me how she takes this supernatural stuff JUST as seriously and presents it in the same tone. It doesn't help that a lot of her ""facts"" (""this FBI agent believed him, so what he said MUST be true"") and theories just wave away simple, realistic answers (maybe the FBI agent was...mistaken???) in favor of the unlikely. It doesn't bother me when LPOTL does it, which I'm trying to rationalize. It might help that Ben is always playing the skeptic, and Marcus does a good job of making sure we know what is fact and what may be fiction, and that their thoughts and theories are just that...thoughts and theories. Plus, it's a lot easier to mix true crime and the supernatural on a comedy podcast, whereas Crime Junkie and Supernatural presents itself as a factual one. So whenever I listen to an episode of Supernatural and then Crime Junkie, I find myself doubting and questioning a lot of the stuff Ashley presents to us as fact. Especially when she takes a little detail of a case and blows it into something big. I just think back to when she does the same thing over something ridiculous in Supernatural and get a bad taste in my mouth. Am I being unfair here? Edit: Apparently they did mention BLM in a previous episode."	20200616T211918

dudeirdk	About The Coleman Family Murder Episode	15	0	This is the episode where “When the head of security for a cutting edge televangelists starts getting threatening emails, no one seems too concerned. But as those threats escalate and eventually come to fruition, law enforcement isn't convinced that everything is as it appears.” They mentioned that the neighbor was a detective and got surveillance cameras installed when the family received threats. Ashley talked about the surveillance tapes when the family received the threatening letters, but didn’t mention them after the murders. I feel like the cameras would’ve been a very important part of saying whether it was the husband or the “stalker”. Does anybody know any extra information about the surveillance?	20200615T023042

nope_9	Monsters of Ohio Theory	34	0	I was listening to this week's episode and couldn't help but get frustrated with Ashley about the grass in the girl's underwear. Brit brought up how she could have been dragged through a field (which I am very proud of her for), but Ashley just dismisses it because it was in her underwear? First of all, I am a goalkeeper and have played soccer all my life so that is the backstory behind my opinion on it. In goalkeeping, you slide on the ground a lot. And whether you're on turf or grass, it is so easy to get grass and dirt where you don't want it. This is what immediately came to mind when they brought this up, so this would point to a slightly weaker suspect who didn't have the strength to carry her the whole time.	20200610T015301

zoukseee	"Anyone else bothered by the ""Karina Holmes"" episode?"	4	0	"I made an account just to air my grievances. Bear with me since I heard this episode a long time ago, so I might not remember all of the details. At some point in this episode (the one about the au pair who was murdered), Ashley mentions something about the boyfriend or love interest of the au pair Karina, who was kind of an edgy dude and in a band. Anyway, Ashley mentions how that band sings a song containing the lyrics ""I got the old man's car, I got a jazz guitar, I got a tab at Zanzibar's tonight"". Zanzibar was the name of the bar the au pair frequented before she was murdered. Ashley posited these lyrics as possible proof to the boyfriend being the murderer, or that he was still haunted by the girl's death, etc etc. Those lyrics struck me as soon as I heard them, because they are Billy Joel lyrics from the song ""Zanzibar""!!! I mean if Ashley had been even doing remotely any Google searches, she would have found that out. It's not like it was a super edgy underground band that wrote the song. At any rate, this makes the boyfriend COVERING, not writing the song, seem like a weird coincidence. I don't know. This sub just makes me realize how terrible some of the journalistic practices are of Ashley. I mean, I'm a high school sophomore and I put more research into my school papers. I know about the whole plagiarism thing, but for some reason this was the incident that really soured Crime Junkie for me. I've listened to basically every episode, so I've already given Ashley a lot of money I suppose, but alas. Just thought I would post this here to see if anyone else noticed this."	20200529T151335

akayep	Do you prefer to listen to episodes on cases that you are already familiar with, or would you rather listen to an episode about a case that you have never heard of?	8	0	Just curious on everyone's thoughts on this. I personally prefer to listen about cases that are new to me. I consume a lot of true crime, including podcasts, YouTube videos, books, tv shows, and tend to hear some cases over and over. In my opinion, Crime Junkie is too short of episodes to really deep dive into a case, therefore I prefer to listen to new cases on the podcast instead of listening to a short summary of a case that I already know a lot about.	20200526T025122

I listen everyday (I started late so I’m like 2 years behind) and I love the show HOWEVER, I can’t stand that they call dogs pruppets. Does that bother anyone else?! Lol. Also, in the early episodes Britt would offer her 2 cents and I would just be like “plz stop talking” (I appreciate her more now and I think Ashley even writes her responses and input so she can seem like the listener) Also, I hate how Britt tries to be relatable but it’s not at all. I cringed so hard when she was like “luckily my daughter has a room on the second floor...” and I know having a 2-story house doesn’t make you rich or anything, but like come on. NOT RELATABLE and no one cares. “Oh I married my high school sweetheart” ....I thought she was home schooled? Lol Is that mean of me?

I unsubscribed months ago after feeling very underwhelmed with the amount and quality of content that I was paying for. And now I am reminded of that. The May episode is almost unlistenable. It is hard to follow along, the story jumps around. $5 a month for 30 minutes of content is extremely steep (I pay $5.99 for hulu and get hundreds of thousands of hours of movies and tv shows) and the content is not even close to being worth it.

Marzipannn_	The more I listen the more irked I get	1	0	I feel like crime junkie was one of the first podcasts that made me fall in love with true crime podcasts. I know got a lot of scrutiny last year for that plagiarism but I looked past it because I loved the podcast. The more I branch out and listen to other podcasts I can’t help but notice the similarities. I am currently listening to episode 11 of And That’s Why We Drink and they are covering the Elisa Lam case and the elevator game in the same episode, something I originally paid to hear in crime junkies patreon. Honestly I’ve started to lose my respect for the show the more I hear it myself. Yes I’ll still listen, I like having the audio on while I’m doing things and I know it’s a much different way of story telling. I just wanted to believe that crime junkie was able to come up with this stuff on their own..	20200508T181005

allykat96	Deleted Episodes??	1	0	Hi everyone, I’ve listened to Crime Junkie for over a year now (before the plagiarism scandal.) Am I crazy, or did they delete a significant number of episodes after this happened? There are several episodes I wanted to re-listen to, but I can’t find them on Spotify. Does anyone know when/why they were deleted? And does anyone *fingers crossed* have the names of the cases/episodes that they took down? In particular, I remember an episode about young girls brutally murdered on the same beach in California - I wanted to follow up on this case but don’t remember the names of the victims, suspects, etc.	20200506T170107

__Stoicatplay88	Mitrice Richardson	1	0	I found this episode so tragic and sad. It was not their best episode, but they deserve a few kudos for: - covering a victim of color. - avoiding stereotypes about race, mental illness, social class. - withholding any “armchair diagnosing.” - providing detailed information about victim’s behavior.

I'm normally all for this podcast, I actually really enjoy it but 30 minuets is not a long enough. When you listen to multiple true crime podcast you're bound to listen to the same story multiple times. But I feel like they leave out important information.

This struck me surprising and quite ironic, and I can't help but wonder if he is trying to dig up information for any connections to him. This just seems really odd. What do you guys think?

sherlockiangigi	Donating to Relief Efforts	3	0	Hey all, I don't usually do this, but I am a bit disappointed with Ashley and Brit. Don't get me wrong, I am SUPER happy they are giving back to the community especially with everything going on in the world right now. However, donating just $1 for every tier and $5 for the highest tier? That seems like a slap in the face... I know anything and everything helps, but I feel that with as many Patreon members they have (which has conveniently been hidden on their site) and I am a $20 member, a bit more than $1 per member of the 2 lower tiers and $5 per member of the highest tier feels warranted. I enjoy CJ very much so, and I don't plan on not being a supporter, just wish they did a bit more for the community. Vent over. Thanks for listening. #StayHome #StaySafe #StayHealth	20200413T160124

__Stoicatplay88	Lipstick Killer discussion	25	0	What are your thoughts on this case, and the way it was presented? In my opinion, it was not as bad as previous recent episodes. Of course, Ashley continues to misspeak buzz phrases, such as in 13:06 when she says that by June 1946, the case was “all but cold, until an unlikely suspect turns the case upside-down.” I might be nit picky right now, but I think she should say that the case “growing cold” so that the following could make sense. If the case is “all but cold” it means that there are leads and so a development would not be considered unexpected. Am I being too pedantic? Should we maintain them at a higher standard of quality?	20200406T165523

anonymous	Ashleys excitement	305	0	God forbid anyone critique the show on this thread but here it is: sometimes how excited Ashley gets talking about murder and rape makes me cringe. Before y’all come for my neck, understand that I am in law enforcement, see and handle gruesome cases and have certainly had to learn how to develop a dark sense of humor. BUT I feel like Ashleys tone in this podcast can be inappropriate for the story at hand sometimes. Having been in court for gruesome cases on multiple occasions and listening to attorneys speak of crimes with passion in their voice but still maintaining empathy...Ashley really lacks the empathy, honestly her and Brit both do. I do listen to the show every week because I like hearing different perspectives of cases but this is something that is really starting to get under my skin. The childish reactions of Brit just make it worse too sometimes she literally may as well be saying “Wait what!? He murdered AND raped her! No way tell me more Ash!” It is great they are excited about their show and job but it seems it kind of mocks the lives of the people and troubling stories being told as if it’s a campfire ghost story. *let the downvotes begin*	20200326T000552

I've also noticed they play these fears up in ads. I don't know I just get the vibe they see someone in hoddie or something walking down the street and they are like ""OMG I almost got murdered."".

throwaway635285	Brit is expected to pay for her travel expenses	3	0	I hesitate to share what I do for work, but you can trust me that I have worked very closely with the CJ hosts multiple times in the past year. I do contract sound work at a venue in a city they frequently book shows, so I don’t want to jeopardize the venue’s relationship with CJ. In my occasional conversations with Brit, who (despite her reputation in this sub) is actually super delightful, I learned that Ashley is sole owner of the company and makes Brit pay for her own expenses when traveling. I felt awfully sorry for her so I bought her a drink, but I thought that it was crazy that with all the money they earn, Brit would have to spend her own money to book a hotel, spend on food, etc. Also, she seemed to have accidentally implied that she has to stay in a different (and subpar) hotel than Ashley, due to her tight budget. When I asked if she got reimbursed she shook her head and laughed it off. Just thought I’d give insight on their friendship.	20200309T222212

Brit's response: ""Omg! Wait! Wasn't that the van that they spotted behind the gas station?"" Like yes, we know! We're not stupid, or affected by extremely poor short-term memory. We don't need our hand to be held through the episode. A gasp would have sufficed to reiterate that it was the same van."	20200302T202528

Additionally, plans were discussed to attend a local party. Skylar was initially reluctant to sneak out, but Rachel and Shelia continued to convince her to come with them and Skylar eventually agreed. With Shelia driving and Rachel in the passenger seat, Skylar got into the backseat of the car shortly before midnight. What Skylar didn’t know is that she had just fallen into a sinister trap that had been premeditated for many months. They drove across the West Virginia border into Pennsylvania where they stopped on a rural road at a hangout area known to the girls. The plan was to hang out at this spot and talk for a while and to smoke. While walking away from the car, the girls stated that they had forgotten a lighter which caused Skylar to volunteer to return to the car for hers. As Skylar turned around, Rachel Shoaf and Shelia Eddy pulled out kitchen knives that they concealed in their hoodies and began savagely stabbing Skylar repeatedly. Skylar then began to run for her life only to be tackled in the street by Rachel Shoaf. Skylar was able to briefly wrestle the knife from Rachel and then use it to inflict a large gash on Rachel’s lower leg. At this time, Shelia Eddy continued stabbing Skylar while Rachel regained control of her knife and joined in for a second time. Sometime shortly after midnight on Friday July 6, 2012, Skylar Annette Neese, succumbed to an estimate of over 50 stab wounds. After Skylar died, Rachel and Shelia attempted to dig a grave to bury her body. However, they found the ground to be too hard so instead they collected logs and shrubs from the area to cover her body which they hid behind a tree. The following morning Skylar’s dad, Dave, needed her to give him a ride to work. When he knocked on her door there was no answer. He then went outside to peek into her room and discovered a foot stool near her window. After finding the this Dave knew that Skylar had snuck out. Dave then tried numerous times to reach Skylar by phone to no avail. He called his wife, Mary (Skylar’s mom) to let her know that he couldn’t find her. She told him that Skylar had to work at a local fast food restaurant late that afternoon and not to worry. They agreed that they would call the restaurant to speak to Skylar shortly after she reported for work. However, her employer called Dave and Mary first after being concerned that Skylar was late for work. At this point Dave and Mary knew that something was very wrong and they phoned the police. Since it was 4th of July weekend, the police advised Dave and Mary to wait it out over the next few days in case Skylar had gone off for an impromptu trip without telling them. Dave and Mary knew she would never do such a thing but they had no choice but to wait. When Skylar did not return over the weekend, the investigation really began to escalate. Surveillance video was discovered that showed Skylar entering a vehicle under her own free will. It was eventually determined that the car belonged to Shelia Eddy. After being confronted, the girls admitted that Skylar had snuck out of the apartment with them but that they had dropped her off a few blocks away from her apartment shortly thereafter. As the months went on, Dave and Mary experienced excruciating agony in not knowing where their only child was. They were also falsely rumored to have been involved in her disappearance as well, which only added to their torment. As the investigation began to focus more and more on the girls, Rachel Shoaf eventually had a mental breakdown before ultimately confessing to the truth. When asked why they killed Skylar, Rachel responded “Because just we didn’t like her.” On May 9, 2023, Rachel Shoaf will have her first parole hearing, almost 11 years to the date of her full involvement in the planning and killing of Skylar Neese. We, the family and friends of the Neese family, remain steadfast in our belief that Rachel does not deserve to be paroled after serving less than half of her initial prison sentence. Rachel was just as complicit as Shelia Eddy in this savage murder. Rachel spent months lying to her family, friends and authorities regarding the truth of what happened to Skylar Neese. She knew all along what happened and she did not tell the truth until. As Dave Neese said in his victim impact statement during the initial sentencing in 2014 “The walls began closing in on her” and that is why she eventually confessed. Please consider signing the petition and please help the Neese family assure that 1 of their daughter’s killers remains behind bars.	20230413T223858
jenny1406	Help!!!	1	0	"so for days i have this episode stuck in my mind that i listened to when i first started listening to CJ. i don't remember that much if it anymore sadly, i do remember that it was a murder case and it was solved, i think it was a woman who got killed by a ""family"" friend (like friend of her and her spouse?) or someone fairly close like that that's all i remember but i can't get it out of my head and searched and searched for it (oh and it wasn't karen gregory)"	20230413T123401
ohhgrrl	Help me find episode about teen girls who hit the mom with a rock.	14	0	Update: It’s the Juliet Hulme (Anne Perry) and Pauline Parker case. Ashley covered it on International Infamy, not Crime Junkie. Juliet/Anne died yesterday which is what reminded me of the story. I’m struggling to remember the details but fairly certain it was a CJ episode. A girl shows up at a park office or something like that saying her group was attacked. It was a mom, her daughter, and a friend. Investigators found a rock at the scene and determined the mom was murdered. I could be totally remembering this incorrectly, it’s possible one of the girls was murdered but not the mom. I’ve been searching key words and getting nothing. The fact I know for certain is there was an adult and two teens on a hike and only two were alive.	20230412T210611

lightmyflyer	What kind of world do we live in?	18	0	I listened to the episode about Brittanee Drexel and it always makes my stomach about these women or girls being trafficked, sexually assaulted or both and there are these just deranged groups of people in society that witness it and do nothing. Like people even other women will see it and do nothing (sometimes out of fear, sometimes because they just completely lack empathy). It’s disturbing and I feel like there needs to be much more accountability to these people. Lives could literally be saved but people are more interested in “protecting somebody they know,” instead of saving a life. It makes no sense. I don’t know where this rant is going and I don’t have a solution that is legal but a lot shitty people should be answering to a higher power.	20230411T022225

paulnewman_aridehome	Finally able to put my finger on it.	138	0	Been a long time listener. Never been a die-hard follower, but a fairly faithful listener. But lately I found myself less and less likely to actually listen to the backlog of episodes in my podcast app. And I think I realized why I don’t always want to listen to it—— they are ALL unsolved. All. I can’t remember the last time there was a fairly wrapped up case. I know there’s a reason— to raise awareness of cold/unsolved cases— But it still is a different vibe than having resolution at least SOMEtimes. So I might just take a break. Maybe I’ll come back when I’m needing more unsolved-type cases.	20230406T225539

I think all the interesting tid bits that Brit adds gives a more conversational feel to the podcast and she seems pretty genuine in most her reactions.	20230406T204425
ikeamonkeystan	The Deck Episode - Lawrence O’Connell	11	0	I appreciate the detectives reflection on his terrible policing during this … but like … why was there almost no focus on the victims of this case ?

Expensive_Storm_4810	Human Trafficking food for thought and question	19	0	why is human trafficking/child trafficking/sex trafficking so rarely considered in missing and murdered persons cases? I know people have their opinions about it being a hysteria theory. I studied child and human trafficking in college and there is just so little public information available for people to understand that it is a horrifying and very real problem. Often, missing children are taken by family or friends, but not always. Think about where this data comes from... It comes from evidence that leads to solved cases: evidence where cases are solved. The solved cases provided tangible and quantitative data. A number of missing children found with relatives or family friends= data. But what about the number of children missing, with no leads, no evidence, no body? This can't be quantified because they aren't solved. So therefor, there is little quantitative data to definitively state the number of children missing to trafficking. Because these children are not found. Because there is not enough being done to combat trafficking. There is not enough information publicly available for people to consider it global crisis. Make sense now? The only time it seems to ever be suggested is in regards to prostitution of a missing person, where there is tangible evidence that they participated in prostitution by coercion or choice. I've never heard it offered as possibility where the missing child or person was legitimately taken out of the blue. So what is the problem in your opinion? Why is it so rarely presented as possibility in these missing/vanished/murdered people podcasts? &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; EDIT: I want to add that I am writing with reference to any missing persons, not just children under 17.	20230328T152537

p_oho	I think I’m done with CJ	398	0	I’ve listened to every episode and kept up all the way through. Despite a distaste for Brit and her commentary I’ve sat through them, but lately, seems like there’s just a lack of what it used to be. Not only am I sick of her self-promotion endlessly, but 3-minutes of ad reads before an episode? Just gives me the feeling that she sold out at this point. The book promotion for months and now the deck investigates not only was it incessant about the tour but now for the podcast that got released it just falls flat for me. The Deck Investigates could’ve been a 45-minute episode if she didn’t add her opinions throughout the facts and the build up to lead to just a “here’s to hoping” ending just seemed not worth it. I’m sure I’ll get hate for this, but I think I’m going to stop listening from here on out.	20230328T004308

Wintermom	Recent eps, more swearing?	45	0	I swear just as much if not more than the next person. However, I’ve noticed a lot more, bleeped out swearing. Perhaps scripted? Anyway, it kind of throws me off a bit since they didn’t seem to do it before. It kind of changes the vibe a bit. I think it started once Britt was gone and then moreso now that she’s back. Anyway, would love to hear what others think. Edit: Didn’t think this would gain attention at all! So to elaborate my view point on this: the bleeping sounds dumb. Trashy as others have said. It sounds like they’re trying hard to be “cool”. Just kills the vibe. Either swear, non bleeped, and not make it sound like you’re suddenly a bad ass. Or just dont swear at all. That’s all.	20230321T040810

heroine_kokomo	Today's Episode 3.20.23 - Murdered: QC Chadwick	20	0	\*\* Spoiler for those who haven't listened to this episode yet \*\* I was mildly disappointed with today's episode about the murder of QC Chadwick. I am not a podcast creator and clearly do not know how much time and effort goes into the research and creation of each episode, but today's felt very rushed. They mentioned that Peter had been unfaithful and had questionable search history but I feel that the reasoning for his killing QC wasn't talked about enough - or if this information was never known they didn't explicitly state it. They did mention that the kids were left out of much of the media which is completely understandable but minus the mention of a few google searches, I felt like we didn't get enough background to fully understand QC and Peter's relationship and Peter went from shady internet searches to murder. I would love to hear everyone else's thought and whether or not you felt just as unsatisfied with this episode as I did. Maybe there will be more information to come? Also, this is just my personal opinion, but I do hope that Claudia's family files charges against Peter - would love to hear thoughts on that too.	20230320T141021

anonnnnnnn10110	Feeling a little…. Uncomfortable? With the Deck Investigates and wondering if I’m in the wrong here	76	0	So I’m a die hard CJ fan, to be fair. Listen to The Deck on occasion as well so this by no means is hate, but hoping to have a discussion and honestly be corrected if I’m wrong on this. I’m currently on episode 10 of The Deck Investigates and loved it at first. This actually happened ten minutes away from my hometown and I had never heard about it so I was super interested. Until a bit later, when Ashley and Emily started getting involved. Again, please feel free to correct me if I’m wrong here, but to me it felt very, very invasive. Contacting people involved in the case and not even mentioning they are recording, and I feel like they intentionally are painting those involved in a bad light without they themselves having any concrete evidence (so far as of Ep 10) or anything but word of mouth or short news clippings and case reports. So I don’t know. I’m honestly conflicted. Are reporters and podcasters just allowed to do that? I know Ashley is passionate about solving cold cases, especially so close to home, but dogging on those involved (the prosecutor, Kenneth?) seems like it could be potentially harmful to solving it, especially with the platform that CJ has. So far when listening, I was angry at the prosecutor and thought for sure it was Kenneth, and then they go and interview them and it’s like well? Is the prosecutor just protecting information that hasn’t been released? And then if Kenneth *is* innocent, aren’t we just setting him up for a life of harassment? Like as much as I love CJ, Ashley and Emily aren’t trained investigators. Can they just be doing this with the platform they have? Again, I love CJ and I really am looking for open discussion here. If I was wrong at any point of if you disagree, or even if you agree, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on this too. Also side note: was never the biggest Brit fan but since her comeback she’s been hilarious and I love her and her interjections so much now. If you see this somehow Brit, please keep it up and keep being you bc I love it. That is all.	20230319T224555

I’ve always thought this and always have a giggle, they make me feel like I would not cause a crime based on my fear for how they describe me. “Suggest that the offender is lacking in universal skills” “Has a difficult time relating to females” “Would be described as a loner” “If employed, would not be a good worker”	20230313T221433

Tinymarshmello	The Deck Investigates Thoughts	44	0	I don’t want to ruffle any feathers, I’m just curious what everyone’s opinions are. I gotta say personally, although there were a lot of suspects and convicted suspects at that, I don’t know how I feel about going after people so publicly when they very well could have nothing to do with the case. Don’t get me wrong, a lot of these guys are obvi not the most trustworthy or ethical people themselves, but I still wonder if the deck could have taken a few things slightly too far. What does everyone think? Did the go to far with some of their techniques? Is it ethical? Or was it justified? I’m not finished it yet I’m on ep. 13, but I think it’s well done. Very well researched of course, but I dont know how I feel about the ethical side of it tbh.	20230312T021414

Providencetown	I-71 Ohio Highway	25	0	This weekend i took a road trip to Colombus and took the I-71 through Ohio. Couldn’t help thinking about the Dr. No case crime junkie, especially when stopping off at truck stops along the way. Those woods on either side of the highway are pretty eerie. The highway itself isn’t as busy as the types I’m used to, and in the foggy weather it’s downright creepy. But maybe I’m biased. Saw a lot of cops/troopers staked out, reminded me of that case where a man pretended to be a police officer to pull drivers over on a busy highway. Anyone remember what case that was?	20230307T023136

emeraldechos	CJ listens 😊	53	0	This mornings episode was a solved one! And just a sad one. I dislike the perp so much. Selfish and creepy. And I think CJ does a good job with listening to their listeners without snide or passive aggressive comments unlike other tc podcasts.	20230306T144208

BulldogMama13	Does anyone else feel like the Arnold and Ruby mini episode case is SOOOO not a crime? It’s so obvious to me that they just died at the scene and I felt crazy listening to this CJ ep.	25	0	The ditch they crashed in had a nearby pond that was quite deep, and it was iced over. They had been drinking and it’s not unreasonable to think they may have tried to leave the scene to avoid cops. It seems like 1000000% possible that they got out of the car, walked on thin ice, and one or both went under and drowned. It can be really hard to tell where cracks or loose portions of ice are, and searchers miss bodies in water ALL. THE. TIME. It makes a ton of sense that as the weather warmed up and the ice melted, the bodies were discovered where they lay the whole time. It’s not suspicious that they were missing shoes or accessories, because that happens all the time with drowning victims. I feel like Ashley was totally barking up the wrong tree here and while it is tragic, it’s not a crime or a mystery how these young people died. (Rightful) Mistrust of cops from the Native American community probably made the situation worse. /rant…. This was just such a frustrating episode for me to listen to. Anyone else feel the same?	20230301T180820

jesus_ate_your_mum	why are the new crime junkie eps so hard to listen to?	98	0	I'll start by saying I listen DAILY... and on repeat to alot of episodes, and I love crime junkie. Its not intended as a hate. But around brit dropping off, I barely listened to them in the background and was so excited when she came back, figuring that would solve my attention span issues. Its slightly better. I love brits inputs. But I still can't listen to the new ones with any attention or joy. I can't put my finger on why they've lost their spark. I think Ashley is a bit harsher toned with brit, and I don't like that... or maybe it's that they seem to be doing much simpler cases with no twists and turns and solvability, they seem simple mysteries. Not that they're unimportant not to speak on, just perhaps not a whole podcast full of information, it seems more drawn out and less heart. I just can't put my finger on why I've lost love for it ..	20230222T211419

DamianLillard0	Episodes that focus on cases that have large online engagement?	8	0	Love crime junkies, but hate finishing an episode and going to research the case online afterwards and seeing next to no discussion about the case on Reddit.

I sent the moderators a note using the info in the “About” section a couple days ago about it but no response. Doesn’t look like either of them have been actively involved in this forum for months (but I could be checking the wrong place for that info).

Organic_Barnacle2512	My experience when I called out crime junkie	56	0	So Crime Junkie banned me. I have screenshots, but i cant post both a story and photos. Or maybe im too new to reddit still. Yesterday I found out about a podcast that is the orginal podcast based off of cold case playing cards. It came out before the deck but doesnt have much traction. When i was scrolling through my feed on faceboom after that i saw a thread where people were discussing the decks live show. So i posted a comment reccomending the podcast i found, Dealing Justice, for everyone since it is very similar and, I feel, deserves credit and repor for its orignial idea. I checked the group rulea before posting the commenr and there was not a rulw that i couldnt post a podcast suggestion. Today I saw my comment was deleted. I posted a comment asking why, figuring the admins are too hardcore of fans to allow it. I soon realized that the discussion group was run by the offical crime junkie page. So i posted not so nice reposne to my inquiry. It basically said that i must have upset someone by reccomending the podcast that the deck is a rip off of, and just like the plagarizm getting swept under the rug, audiochuck removes anythung they dont like. Then they banned me from the group. Cant even find it in a search. In conclusion, the crime junkie/audiochuck team prefers to remove anythung that calls them out. They never apologized for the plagarizm. Then they ripped off another podcast, which they knew about because when they first worked with Tommy Ray when starting the deck he informed them that there was already a podcast that does exavtly what they wanted to start, covering cold case deck cases. When someone brings this up, they get banned. The hosts call for people to be held accountable for their actions in each episode, but refuse to take accountibility, or even address, their own actions. Shame. Edit to provide more clarity: Someone posted in the Crime Junkie Podcast Discussion group about how much the loved the deck live show they attended. It had a lot of comments so i commented adding the podcast suggestion and it got deleted. When i commented again to call them out on it. I got blocked. The page is run by the official crime junkie podcast page. Some i pissed off soemone offical	20230221T155441

I actually found it though another thread on this reddit (or whatever terminology is correct) It was started BEFORE the deck and the hosts work with Tommy Ray, the cold case deck creator who is their executive consultant.

littlebear406	Getting a little tired of the self righteousness	105	0	I feel like lately Ashley has been on her high horse about how poorly investigators are doing their job. I definitely understand talking about cases where they were undoubtedly in the wrong, but it just seems like even when it isn't black-and-white, she's dogging on the investigators constantly saying what they should or shouldn't do. Especially cuz she doesn't have all the information they have, they're obviously making decisions based on the evidence. And she makes comments like they're completely incompetent and acts like she has all the answers. Like I'm sorry, I get you love true crime but you're not an expert on solving cases. Plus half the stuff she's preaching about is hindsight. I might be alone in this but it's getting to the point where I'm rolling my eyes every time she gets all high and mighty with her opinions.	20230221T080310

LaserLemonLolita	Tangentially related, but I can’t stand the Madison Reed ad	52	0	I know MR is all over women-led podcasts, and I’ve always not been much of a fan (bad experience with their coloring in the past) but I’m really bothered by the phrasing in CJ’s most recent episode (Jessica Heeringa). Specifically the phrase about hair salons charging hundreds of dollars and that “we are being robbed”. Look, I’m all for people who can pull off box dye, but also it’s so weird to shame going to the salon? It’s expensive, sure, but it’s also my hair that is on display to the world literally all the time. I’m willing to pay for it to look good. I’m also bothered by the implication that stylists are overcharging or robbing us. My stylist performs an art in my mind, and I’ve never felt like she charges too much. Maybe it was just the tone of the piece, but it felt very condescending. Mini-rant, would love to hear other thoughts.	20200302T143335

killiangrief	Can not recall the episode where the Grandfather or Uncle clearly was the culprit	26	0	There was an episode in which a young woman, of course, was going out of town (I think to get married) and went missing.

Though it came out later after she was clearly missing that he actually supposedly dropped her off at the mall because her flight was delayed, but there was never any footage of them or her at the mall.

truetdrye	Episode 8 of Counter Clock podcast	6	0	"Over all the Audio Chuck/ Ashley Flowers produced podcast ""Counter Clock"" has been a nice listen. The story is gripping the narrator isn't boring and by he quality of the podcast is legitimate. However episode 8 rubbed me the wrong way! This is strictly an opinion. Let's not get that confused. Am I the only one that feels like this though? I feel as though episode 8 was VERY messy and. Jumped from the genre of investigative podcast to flat out messy tabloid! It all started once she finally got ahold of the Eric guy. This part was flat out cringe worthy. Don't get me wrong, maybe a good investigative podcast calls for cringe worthy moments. It doesn't change my mind about the show. I still think the show is great. It's awesome that Audio chuck is sticking to their mission of bringing light to cases that haven't received the national exposure that others have.

I just don't understand why they're so adamant in not getting help in solving this case. The sister could've probably gotten closure years ago. And what's even worse is that what can she do?! She can't get a PI because of the deal she made with the authorities and even with all the media coverage she's getting they're still not doing anything! I feel just as stuck and frustrated as Jenny is. Can anyone with maybe more experience in the police force say something about why they're not doing anything???	20200221T013319

AmberLegend	The latest episode of crime junkie	43	0	In the latest episode Ashley says something to the effect of...the case of Unique's disappearance was reignited by a reddit post where a reddit user claimed to copy something from Unique's mother, Valencia's, fb page (that big long post that Brit read starting at approx. 41 minutes into the podcast). I looked at Valencia's GoFundMe that is set up for the purpose of helping Unique’s case, the one that Brit and Ashley posted themselves, and there was the whole fb status that Brit had just read, posted by Valencia herself. I know this is nit-picky but I just find Brit and Ashley so disingenuous sometimes. I mean, they couldn't even be bothered to look at the GoFundMe page for this cause they care so much about? Ashley could only find evidence of that post from reddit, when the GoFundMe says Valencia posted that herself on September 17th,2018...I don't know if I'm missing some info or critiquing too harshly. I just find that oversight particularly careless of them...that is all.	20200218T114813

TySoprano	Return to form and criticism	32	0	I’ve been one of the hardest critics on this show over the last whatever weeks/months it’s been since the quality really dropped. I even stopped my Patreon and donated instead to a few YouTube channels I enjoy more. BUT I have to say the last few episodes have been great. Britts cookie cutter dialogue has been dialed down some, especially in the Rodney Alcala episode, I don’t think she said “wait, what “ even once. Ashely hasn’t been over dramatizing her speech patterns/delivery and they aren’t completely jamming sources down our throats, to the same extent. I think the Beaumont children episode was the first that felt different, similar to the old days, as has been pointed out here already. I truly hope they are actually listening to people and making adjustments. I’ve abandon some of my favorite podcasts because despite constant critique they keep doing the same thing. Looking at you NoSleep. Anyway I hope everyone else has enjoyed these last few episodes as much as I have. Feels good looking forward to the episodes again.	20200214T211648

The survey includes some general demographic questions, but the bulk of it is the fun part! You will act as a mock juror in two (fictional) criminal trials and give your opinions on each case. It should take 10-30 minutes to complete. Although we are all true crime fans here, I'd like to include this statement: These fictional scenarios will include general descriptions of crimes and may be triggering or offensive to some people. The descriptions are not super graphic, but it still makes reference to violent crime, so heads up. TW: crime, homicide, violence, medical examiner / autopsy testimony THANK YOU FOR READING THIS! I am so excited to have the opportunity to work on this project.	20200212T190227

ForUsForThem	Recent episode flows are very clickbait	31	0	"Hey everyone Just wanted to see if anyone else is annoyed of this crap. I absolutely used to love this show but as it goes on I have started to get annoyed at the way the show is set up. It seems so clickbait right before commercial when Ashley goes ""until they found his one thing that changed the trajectory of this case......"" Add commercial, come back and it's nothing but a few pictures that still didn't get them closer to anything This is so annoying to me. I won't stop listening if u tell me straight up they found pictures go on commercial and come back and explain rather than making me believe serving big happened when nothing did. It is so annoying and I have noticed this more and more in the recent episodes. I also thought these cases were well researched, however the case on Tim Bosma's killer was not covered properly, they pronounced their names wrong and most of the details were said were not even the significant ones. I've been listening to them for over 3 years and sadly... Its the beginning of our end."	20200212T124737

beaarthurismymom	Why do they let Brit do commercials?	66	0	I just listened to the most recent episode(Rodney Acala) and good god the woman can not speak??? I’m so sorry I’m sure she’s really nice but she sounds almost intoxicated, inflects things so strangely, and can barely read. I get that she’s there to say “wait what” and regurgitate what ashley just said to reiterate or whatever, but man if I were the people paying for them to do ads I’d be side eying this for sure. Like does she not read through it to practice? I’ve tried so hard not to be annoyed because they’re just two people making something interesting for us to listen to, but man her inability to read or add anything at all to the show is really getting under my skin. Am I the only one? Edit: it appears they’ve removed the ads from the beginning of the episode. The ones in the middle are still slurry but not nearly as bonkers as the ones in the beginning.	20200210T142524

morrisonlikessamoyed	On the lastest episode...	86	0	Was it just me or the lastest episode on the Beaumont children had the essence of the initial Crimejunkie podcast? It felt like their earlier episodes; the storytelling was interesting, the scripted dialogues didn't seem all over the place, plus the episode was over an hour long. I didn't know about the case before. I will look into it in depth. This is what I used to like about the CJ podcast. They got me interested in cases I hadn't heard of. Perhaps it is just me but I got a freaky feeling as I listened to this episode last night and kinda reminded me of the time I got hooked to the podcast.	20200201T010246
ChiTownChick	Michelle Carter was just released	45	0	I am sorry this post is so long. I know this case has definitely been mentioned before, I just wanted to add my opinion since she was just released way early from prison. I read all the texts between Michelle and Conrad and it was extremely shocking to say the least. The link I posted is the entire court case file. https://www.scribd.com/doc/276206526/Michelle-Carter-Texts I also watched the HBO two part documentary about it. The reason it has captivated my attention so much is that when I was a teenager I attempted suicide a few times. I suffered from depression and anxiety and I was bullied severely in hs before I was sent to a residential for hurting myself. So I can relate to how Conrad felt, and if I’d had a partner at the time who said I should kill myself I think I would’ve. I feel like she craved attention and didn’t have any real friends ( the school friends were just that. They never hung out after school) plus she also has a lot of mental health issues. However I don’t feel sorry her or think her medication caused this. Before and after Conrad’s suicide she acted weird with people. As the prosecutor said when she told two girls he’d killed himself two days before it actually happened, it was a dry run. She wanted to see how much attention she’d get. She even continued to text with his mother for many months afterwards. What really gets to me are the texts that are all in caps saying- “WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?” Over and over plus wen she guilts him and says- “ Well… I guess just because you always say you are gonna do it but you don’t, but last night I know you really wanted to do it and I’m not mad. Well, I mean, kind of, I guess, just because you always say you’re gonna do it… but you don’t but last night I knew you really wanted to and I’m not mad.” And - “ You’re not joking about this or bullshitting me, right? … I just want to make sure you’re being serious. Like I know you are, but I don’t know. You always say you’re gonna do it, but you never do. I just want to make sure tonight is the real thing.” Let’s also not forget her telling one of the girls from her school that he became afraid and exited the car because it was working, and she told him to get back in. She could hear him dying on the phone, yet she did nothing to get him help. After watching the documentary I felt this case was more complicated than I initially thought. I don’t believe in involuntary intoxication from SSRIs. I do know some medications have black box warnings about suicidal ideation or behavior, but I don’t believe her being on celexa had anything to do with what she did. I think she was a very troubled girl who was extremely lonely and wanted attention. After watching the documentary I’m split between thinking she is just delusional ( although her therapist said she said she seemed clear headed and fine) or that she is a girl who would go to any lengths to get attention. She claimed to have almost attempted to hang herself but I honestly don’t know if I believe that. Most of me thinks she was all about getting attention and at some point she decided that getting attention was more important than someone’s life. Just look at the fact that she continued to have contact with his mother, manipulating her for months. It was all about attention. She also asked him to delete their texts before he died which shows that she knew what she was doing was wrong. Then asking Conrad to mention her in his last tweet, and feigning distress when he was missing. Pretending to be worried shows calculation, as does her asking him to delete their conversation. Oddly enough he did delete all of his conversations, but left one conversation undeleted and that was their conversation. I don’t think she should’ve been released extremely early. I don’t think she should’ve gotten two years. In my honest opinion she got out early and only got two years because of her privilege, and because her well off family being able to afford a good attorney. If this had happened to a person who didn’t have so much privilege I think the ending would’ve been way worse for her. Edit- I haven’t seen RedHanded but as a true crime buff I’m always interested in hearing true crime podcasts and seeing documentaries. I don’t want this post to be so divisive. I posted the link so people could read the evidence themselves and so it didn’t seem like I was just saying my opinion without some evidence to back it up. I understand Michelle and Conrad’s relationship was extremely complicated and toxic on both ends at times. Edit- I forgot to mention that Michelle Carter has never apologized nor taken any responsibility for what happened. She was talking to his mom for months. I think she should at least apologize to her about her son committing suicide. That’s what really gets to me is that she never apologized. She didn’t even have to take responsibility but apologize that it happened. Seriously it’s like she only cares about herself and not how what she did affected anyone else.	20200131T111517

Itsonlymedisguise	Podcast Review Post Scandal	52	0	I unsubscribed from their Patreon long before the scandal. I still listen sometimes, though not as much as I once did. Once the scandal broke, I withdrew and found MFM, which has quickly become my favorite TC podcast. About 3 weeks ago, I started listening to CJ again and here is my review for any who would like to know: Ashley and Brit are still doing their same bit of Ashley telling the story, and Brit giving snippets of thoughts and comments. It seems underwhelming and I wish they would mix it up again, with maybe having Ashley listen to a story from her husband, or vice versa with Brit. Something new. Next, I have found that the amount of ads within the podcast seemed to have increased recently. It's almost as if I am skipping through 1/3rd of the episode from just ads. Finally, they have started citing their sources very well. One or two mentions of the 'sources' link on their website would be nice, but Ashley seems to have overcompensated her lack of sources before the scandal with almost citing everything immediately. It's great that she has done this, however this isnt the resolution that I was looking for. Maybe addressing the issue, then giving out the information (sources link) each episode at the beginning and end. Otherwise, it just constantly reminds me of what isnt happening. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.	20200129T015044
silvercricketbarry	Latest Australia episode about the Beaumont children	27	0	Okay so I’ve been a weekly listener of CJ for over a year now. I binged the first 60-something episodes while I was moving into a new apt and unpacking last Dec/early Jan. This is the first time I’m truly pissed/annoyed at them. They somewhat frequently tell their listeners that they deeply care about Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women in the US and Canada (but, you know, don’t actually cover those cases or bring attention to other podcasts that do or bring any attention to recent cases like Selena Not Afraid), yet they started the episode with “Happy Australia Day!!!!!” It felt very tone deaf and disrespectful to Indigenous folks in Australia who consider “Australia Day” to be Invasion Day. It’s similar to celebrating Columbus Day in the US, and it just rubbed me the wrong way	20200128T132820

ponderous_	If I Go Missing : Tanya Rider Episode	45	0	So honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes. I love that Brit got to host it and tell us a story instead of Ashley.

Body . Chills* - ***No I get to say it, it's my job*** - such a cringe moment for me.

spectacleskeptic	View from a casual listener	67	0	I would consider myself a casual listener of Crime Junkie. I don't listen to every episode; I only listen to episodes that pique my interest. There is something that bugs me about Ashley. Some of the things she says makes me think that she feels superior to Britt. I wish I could pinpoint specific examples, but there are times when she will use words that indicate ownership of the podcast, as though the podcast is only HERS and not hers and Britt's, and taking credit for it. The way she responds to Britt in ways that seem dismissive, which is just not fun to listen to and makes me feel bad for Britt. Obviously, I do not know anything about what type of relationship Ashley and Britt have, so I am only speaking on what comes across on the podcast.	20200122T030925

TySoprano	About unlistenable	69	0	I’ve loved this podcast for some time and I’ve listened to every free and Patreon episode. But it’s about to the point it’s unlistenable and I hate it. I miss when Ashley just read the stories. But now every other line she does the deep, slow, over articulated delivery and it’s absolutely cringe worthy. I try to skip past those lines when I feel them coming. “What....they......FOUND.....chilled.....them.....to.....the.....BONES....FOREVER”. I would pay twice as much a month if she would just read the story and never ever do those again. But what really gets me is how many stories they write off as someone just “stepped away from their lives”. Really ? Any story past 1990 that option is unlikely. They’ve had so many stories where the person didn’t take any cash, never used a credit/bank card again, was never seen on any of the millions of cameras across the United states again and their ID or SS was never flagged again. Do you know how hard that would be to do? And how much planning and knowledge it would require and most likely help you’d need. It’s absurd they constantly throw that out as a real possibility for the answer to questions to cases. I want to keep supporting the podcast for the hours and hours of stories they’ve blessed me with over the past years but man it’s getting hard. I never thought Britt would be the LEAST of my complaints.	20200121T204815

deadeyedactress	Other Podcasts Plagiarizing	46	0	I know a lot of people ask for other similar podcasts because they got turned off of the plagiarizing in CJ. One of the ones that always gets recommended is RedHanded. I’ve been listening to it sporadically to get a feel but after listening to Episode 91, it is word for word a story done by Damian Barr for the Guardian in which he literally travels to South Africa to gather leads on the story so it is 100% his research. The link to this article isn’t cited in their episode description, which CJ gets a lot of flack for not putting their sources there as well. I felt so strongly about the plagiarism CJ did and was turned off for a while, but literally other podcasts that are being recommended to deal with this are doing the same thing... So am I missing something? Is there a difference? I feel like the lines have gone all blurry.	20200118T015926

avaughan11	What are other true crime podcasts you like and why?	42	0	I enjoy listening to Crime Junkies because I find Ashley’s voice relaxing, and because I feel like the story telling aspect is pretty straight forward and sticks to the details of the case. Last night I attempted to listen to a couple of different ones I’ve seen mentioned on here before. And I didn’t make it through a single episode of any of them. I started on the very first episode of each podcast, so if they get better as time goes on, please let me know. These are the ones I tried. **Morbid**: I couldn’t get into this one because I felt the girls were talking super fast, almost like someone was pressing the fast forward button, and they kept talking over each other. I called it quits about ten minutes in. **True Crime Garage**: Same thing happened with this one. I felt like the fast forward button was being pressed because they talked so fast. I even switched from the podcast app to Spotify to make sure it was actually the podcast and I hadn’t just accidentally changed a setting to speed up the podcast or something. I only made it about 5 minutes on this one before the super fast talking gave me a headache. **My Favorite Murder**: I made it the longest on this one. Probably 15 minutes or so. I looked past their aimless chatter thinking they’d get to the actual murder at some point. Then they started talking about a wreck that happened near their home recently. Apparently the driver was killed in the wreck. When talking about the driver they started describing him as a douchebag and an ass, etc. I just found it super disrespectful and called it quits. Maybe if I’d listened longer they would’ve revealed something about him that makes it clear he was a bad guy or whatever, but I guess I just need my podcasts to be a little more unbiased. Thoughts? Did I judge these too quickly? Are there more out there that are more like CJ with their story telling? Edit to add: I’ve also listened to the first season of Serial, and Undisclosed, which is what got me into true crime podcasts to begin with. I enjoyed both of those.	20200114T194455

nicky_efc	What episode have you listened to that stuck with you the most?	32	0	Mine is definitely Bryce Laspisa, if anyone hasn't listened to it yet I highly recommend! It's the weirdness surrounding the whole story, the fact he was sitting in his car for hours at a time .. the whole driving round before his car was found etc. I do believe he's walked to the truck stop and got a ride off a trucker, as the dogs tracked his scent that far, but it weirds me out the way he was acting! But on the episode the girls use lucid as a term for being fine, okay and in his right mind, but where I'm from lucid means the complete opposite so that was something that confused me slightly (doesn't take away from the story)	20200109T074640

HocusPocus1313	Other podcasts poking fun at CJ?	8	0	I’ve seen the threads about podcasts calling out CJ for plagiarism, but was wondering about other podcasts that poke fun at CJ in general? I casually listen to other podcasts, including MFM. Their latest episode—the 200th episode—started with Georgia and Karen joking about finally doing improv instead of “reading all of their lines.” I know many people talk about how CJ is basically scripted, and I was wondering if others thought MFM might be poking fun at CJ? I don’t mean this post to be too serious or dramatic. I’m genuinely just curious about what other true crime podcasts think of CJ.	20200103T234917

joho259	Searching for an episode?	2	0	I discovered this podcast a couple of months ago and have binged it all along with the $5 Patreon level and I’m looking for a specific episode that I think I listened to fairly recently but can’t for the life of me think of which one it is from titles/ descriptions. Hopefully someone here knows! It’s about a girl who I think skips class and doesn’t return home at the end of the day and her father goes looking for her at the school but it’s all locked up and nobody there, and drives to a couple of guys houses she knows and recognises a truck to be one of her older male friends or something but thinks it would be rude to knock and check because it’s late at night. One of the guys says his alibi is that he was working on set designs(?) at the school until really late. I’m quite hazy on the details as you can tell but I can’t remember what happens and am running out of episodes that I don’t know what happens as soon as they introduce the story, so I hope it’s still available and that someone knows which one I’m (poorly) describing!	20191225T000608

__Stoicatplay88	Just wondering if...	17	0	...Ashley and Britt ever disagree? So this question is half serious, since I know that there’s a lot of filler in the narratives (I.e. Britt’s interjections, elaborating on mundane details, conjectures, etc.). However, I have noticed a bit of nervous tension when Britt’s opinion is kinda, shall we say, far fetched and Ashley immediately will jump and say “Oh, yeah yeah I agree, but THE ABOUT THING IS...” or some variation of that. So, unless Ashley writes Britt’s commentary (and it’s actually Ashley’s own opinion), do both ever have disagreements on the details of a case? Does it seem that Ashley prefers not to dwell in logical debates with Britt by saying she agrees and pushing it aside?	20191224T182745

Recently they’ve done a few Canadian based episodes. One on Dellen Millard and his victim Tim Bosma. Ashley pronounced his name as “Boseman” the entire episode. And now on the Highway of Tears episode she keeps pronouncing the word “province” - as in British Columbia is a Canadian province - as “providence”. It’s starting to drive me nuts. Does anyone else notice? (Still love the show) UPDATE: Jan 27, 2020. On their Australia Day mention, Ashley said she wanted to mention the people suffering through the “brushfire” season. Ash, girl, it’s a BUSH fire.	20191219T120704

larryofks	Ad disappeared? Ep. on Jody LeCornu	9	0	Posting here so I know I'm not going crazy. Over the weekend I was listening to the Dec. 9 CJ episode and around minute 9 they break for an ad that was SO CRINGY I had to stop and go back and listen, then take a screenshot of the time stamp and send it to my friend who also listens to crime junkie. The ad was for fab fit fun (I think?) but it starts with Brit loudly and badly singing along to a random song in the background. Nothing horrible, just really awkward and kind of funny. Then today, my friend and I were talking and I went back to the time stamp I took a screenshot of, and the ad is gone? It's simply not there. Also I see the run time has been altered to be about a minute longer. What's up with that? Am I going insane? Someone tell me they remember the ad I'm talking about.	20191216T154600

deadeyedactress	Statement Analysis BS	18	0	I’m with Ashley when it comes to the statement analysis blog bit. Twice now I’ve heard Brit vouch for this random anon dude who “analyzes” 911 calls and makes it seem like based on the call the person is guilty. There’s never any actual good addition to the story, it’s always super vague like “they used ‘I’ a lot”...like okay? And that means what exactly? In my opinion it’s a waste of breath/seconds/minutes to even entertain those bogus analyses. I’ve heard them use it in two cases now, for the Camm family in which he clearly wasn’t guilty (so what was the point of even including it?!) and the Darlie Routier case. In both scenarios the callers were appropriately distressed parents calling in the murders of their children— of course they sounded completely out of their minds on the calls!

I’ve also read that Ashley writes a script for her and Brit, but I still feel like Ashley is really rude to Brit. I hate putting my own feelings into the podcast, but the way Ashley talks to Brit throughout every episode really irks me. I read someone say that Ashley saw the popularity of MFM’s two women hosts and wanted to copy that, and I believe it. I don’t buy it for two seconds that these two are lifelong friends. I have a lifelong friend that I would never talk to the way Ashley talks to Brit. I think Brit needs to find new friends...	20191202T163829

brtdud7	Is the listener base mostly women?	17	0	"I stumbled upon this podcast after it showing up to ones related to Swindled. Listened to a handful at the beginning but got bored of the missing ones and now only listened to serial killer or a handful of other interesting ones. I knew nothing about any plagiarism before coming here, and find the universal dislike of ""Britt"" (assuming she's a real person and not Ashley in disguise) and her recycled lines and lack of input quite funny. But something I have wondered is, is this show supposed to be mainly for women? It's clearly very woman-focused, the two hosts (assuming Britt is real) are self-proclaimed feminists, and the few episodes they've had with female murderers immediately assume the woman's innocence.

After listening to Trace Evidence’s episode directly followed by re-listening to Crime Junkies episode here were my thoughts: \- The long winded explanation regarding the timing of the dad getting home and CJ not being able to “track to any real source” read to me like “we heard this guy say it, but can’t find where he heard it first” \- Crime Junkie: “Iquilla was quoted telling a newspaper…” which newspaper? What reporter? I had never realized they did this until I payed closer attention. Where are they finding these quotes? \- Crime Junkie: “I found transcripts of the 911 call… deep in the dark web” the closest thing to a citation I’ve heard so far. \- Side note: I was curious about this 911 call log and quickly googled it on my phone while at work and the FIRST RESULT was from a webbsluths post in 2004. A **full** transcript, word for word what was read on Crime Junkie. A dark web search was absolutely not necessary. Kinda seems like they just wanted to sound edgy. \- So far the Crime Junkie episode is just a highlights reel of the Trace Evidence episode. \- Crime Junkie: “someone from the FBI said runaway age start at 12” Who? When? Where can this stat be found? \- Of course the “tree-line” comment that was spoken about in the Let’s Taco ‘Bout True Crime episode. A complete rip off from Trace Evidence’s words. \- The contractor finding the bag, wow. Crime Junkies description was as close as they could get to verbatim without being verbatim. \- Example; CJ “he opens it to find… another black trash bag” TE “inside of the garbage bag… was another garbage bag” THEY JUST SWAPPED THE TERM ‘GARBAGE BAG’ WITH ‘TRASH BAG’ \- CJ describes Asha as “deathly afraid” – TE description: “deathly afraid”. They didn't even bother to rephrase that one. \- After the search (after finding the backpack) CJ: “all they came up with are some animals bones and men’s khaki pants” TE: “… also located in the area were a pair of men’s khaki pants and some scattered animal bones” – Again, just swapping around the words in TE. I understand they are reporting on the same facts, but the delivery is shockingly similar and arguably lazy. \- What bothered me the most was CJ constantly saying “Iquilla said…” but never citing where to find Iquillas statements or words. CJ claiming to be doing this entire episode to draw attention to the case sounds a little rich when they aren’t even saying where we can find the MOTHERS words.	20191122T011954

llamathere	Murder Squad	8	0	I just found the podcast Murder Squad. They have ads for Crime Junkie and in one of the episodes they have Ashley on. I had listened to every episode of Crime Junkie until recently and was also a patreon member at one point but I don't recall them ever mentioning the Murder Squad podcast. Did they ever plug it or have Paul on as a guest?	20191121T005913

CreedBrattonDotCom	Podcast Ratings	34	0	So, many moons ago I recall seeing a thread on here Re: Buying 5 Star Reviews for Crime Junkies. I never really thought about it or cared enough to pay attention to it. But then Red Ball came along....and it sucks....but the ratings on Apple Podcasts are through the roof. So, I took a peek and you can tell the start contrast between actual reviews and what looks like bot reviews.... All of that to say...how much self-gratification do they need? They're already cashing in stupid amounts of money on CJ.	20191120T140437
TheGreatLandSquirrel	Ad Junkies	63	0	Let me start by saying, I really enjoy the podcast. But is it just me or is the number of Ads per episode slowly going up.

finnelope	Red Ball: thoughts and discussions	63	0	Listen, unlike a lot of you I’m actually a massive fan of the podcast. I’ve listened to every episode and am about to join the fan club for the extra episodes. This isn’t meant to tear it down, I’m just trying to gauge what other people thought of it. But I really can’t get over how disappointed I was by red ball. It didn’t go in the direction I wanted and as much as I appreciate how involved Ashley got and the opportunity she had to research the case, I feel like it fell a little short. First off, I was expecting a little more than 4 x 25 minute episodes. I really wanted her to deep dive into the case like she does on a regular podcast episode then involve the P.D in episode 2 or so to cover “what went wrong” then to go on and discuss what the next steps where and all of the suspects etc. I feel like it was really repetitive and didn’t cover much, almost that it could have just been one episode. I hope that if other people feel the same way as me then they will take this into consideration when doing special episodes in the future.	20191119T031619

rascaldascal	Does Crime Junkie donate any proceeds from the show to support victims of crime?	20	0	Given how much money this podcast generates and how they say they champion victims, I was just wondering whether they give money to any victims organizations. I couldn't find anything on the website aside from a mention of crime stoppers in Ashley's bio. I know My Favorite Murder donates a big portion of proceeds from the show and merchandise to End the Backlog foundation and local police departments to eliminate the backlog of untested [r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_kits)ape kits, and True Crime Garage donates proceeds to the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children. The Murder Squad with Jensen and Holes also donates money for DNA testing in unsolved crimes. It just strikes me that Ashley and Brit are profiting off the tragedies of murder victims while giving nothing back to the community which is really disappointing.	20191110T033232

anonymous	The Scandal	55	0	I know I’m beating a dead horse (or feeding a fed horse if you’re sensitive to animal idioms) but I’m truly rocked by this. I had heard rumblings of plagiarizing and I had noticed a few little intricacies that were kinda similar to MFM but I truly enjoyed Ashley’s ability to tell a story. MFM to me is hard to get through sometimes, the 20 minutes it takes to get to the actual story is annoying sometimes so I go through spurts where I listen to MFM but then go weeks without turning on an episode and don’t get me started on the live episodes because those are truly the most annoying. Anyway, so I was super thrilled to find Crime Junkie because they just cut through the chase. I have been binging it for like three weeks straight and even joined Patreon. I joined the reddit group a few days ago where I noticed that this plagiarism thing wasn’t just a small, oh sorry forgot to cite my sources but this was full blown stolen content. If you listen to Let’s Taco ‘Bout True Crime’s run down of “the scandal” and it’s super eye opening and now I’m devastated to know that they duped me.	20191104T154619

CosmicLeo08	"This week's episode should be called ""Clutch your pearls!"""	43	0	So I've never though Ashley and Britt were the sharpest tools in the shed, but this week's episode really annoyed me. They have NO concept of the outside world. For starters, they went on and on clutching their pearls discussing how the teenagers in the 1986 murder of Jennifer Levin were left alone a lot and drank/did drugs. First of all, as someone raise in New York City, kids were and are just that much more independent. And they'd especially have been more self sufficient in the 1980s before the emergence of helicopter parenting. Secondly, the federal drinking age was raised the 21 in 1986 so a lot of those kids had been able to drink until fairly recently. Ashley and Britt acted so outraged by this behavior when it seems pretty par for the course as far as bad teenage behaviour goes. I am sure this is exceptionally nit picky but it bugged me. I just can't stand the pearl clutching of this podcast	20191028T173213
SummerRain88	This might finally push me into the done with CJ camp.	44	0	I really became lukewarm with CJ after the scandal. I still think the way they handled it has been horrible, and that they are getting away with something that in most professions, you’d lose your job over. That said, I still listened on Monday mornings, as a way of getting me through going through all my e-mails. One thing that’s always bothered me about CJ is the way Ashley and Britt seem to prey upon the idea of danger lurking around every corner. The new Simpli Safe add at the beginning of the Full Body Chills (🙄) teaser was fear-mongering at its worst, “The police will never get to you in time!” You think “This will never happen to me” (Spoiler- It probably won’t). It was gross.	20191028T124508

catiehobb	Looking for a good subreddit that actually discusses cases..	40	0	So I joined this subreddit because I just started listening to the podcast after the scandal happened but I hadn’t heard about it when I started listening. I listened to the Lets Taco Bout episode on this scandal and I don’t condone plagiarism at all. I’m not defending it, I think it ripping off other podcasters work is ridiculous and unethical. That being said, I thought this subreddit would be a little bit more than just constantly bringing up the scandal in every post and I was hoping to get more insight or discussion about certain cases that I’ve found interesting. Maybe someone could point me in the direction of a subreddit that’s good about this?? Everyone on here seems like they are well versed in the true crime world so I figured I’d start here.

morrisonlikessamoyed	Storytelling...	75	0	All things aside, and it might only be me, but I think Ashley is a really good storyteller. I have not been a regular listener lately, (not just because of the plagiarism issue but also I think their crime episodes have generally gone down hill...) but I got back to their lastest episode today because it's close to Halloween and I wanted to see if they did some crazy case.. From there I saw they released a newer story based podcast and gave it a listening to. This brings me to the point about Ashley's story telling skills. She is very story at narrating. She gives good expressions and keeps you interested (even if the main story doesn't). This is probably why the podcast got so popular so fast. I know there are loads of good True crime podcasts who actively do the research work, are extremely amicable and intelligent.... However, many of the cases that the CJ covered got more popular because of how well Ash presented those (particularly the older episodes). The eerie, subtle background music does help... I do wish they handled their situation better because Ash truely has good potential to draw in the audience. Ps Does anyone else think the new podcast with daily episodes till Halloween is their way of compensation(?) /apology to their listeners?	20191022T084239

Halfway through the day my boss came over to my desk and we started talking and I decided to put the earbuds in their case. This triggered my phone to start playing the podcast out loud for some reason.

The two episodes in particular were the murders of Shauna Howe and Jessica Dishon. I don’t recall them being mentioned during the whole plagiarism debacle.

eeshelman26	Missing episodes that aren’t missing	7	0	Hey so I just got into “Crime Junkie” very recently since it was a recommendation from a friend and my BF wants to be a cop. I’m just finding out about this scandal because of this subreddit, so I went to look it up. I found an interesting article on variety (https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/crime-junkie-podcast-ashley-flowers-plagiarism-1203302072/) that mentions a few episodes she’s taken down. However I just listened to those episodes not that long ago. At first I was relieved I got to them before they were taken down but then I checked the publishing date on the article and it was August 15th and I listened to those episode maybe 2 weeks ago when my bf and I had a road trip lasting 8 hours. I’m so confused on what this means. Any ideas?	20191005T095237

My heart breaks for her family, it seems like there’s so many unanswered questions regarding her disappearance. Everyone involved in this case has lawyered up and stopped talking...which is a red flag to me. Someone knows what happened to her and I can only hope they’ll decide to come forward one day.

Algernon96	Weird question about live shows	19	0	I’m asking this without judgment, because I’d be curious what the draw was before the whole plagiarism thing, too: For folks who thought it worth it to pay to see them, what was it that you thought was worthwhile about a live show over a podcast episode? To anyone who’s been to one: Was it worth it? Do they do anything live they don’t do on the podcast? Or is it really just worthwhile enough to see them do it? I’m curious more as a creator than anything, honestly. I saw Oh No with Ross and Carrie live, but i just kind of stumbled into it for free. I enjoyed it, but they tailored the show to a local incident and it was a one-time investigation. I’m just wondering what a scripted podcaster can do to make $30 tickets worth it. It just never had occurred to me to pay that much to see a podcast I can otherwise hear for free. Again, not judging. I’m just curious.	20190928T200902

Busanjin	Is anyone else tired of the outrage?	17	0	I understand that true crime podcast hosts invest a lot of time and effort into the making of their shows, but I also think that they are being prima donnas. At the end of the day, they are doing little more than reading Wikipedia and scouring public sources. How much ownership should one really have the ability to claim about a paraphrased collection of facts? The other thing that bothers me is that all these shows are ultimately building a brand for themselves and earning significant money through sponsorships, affiliate links, and Patreon donations, on the back of human tragedies. To what extent can they consider themselves so morally superior when they profit from the misery of others? I don't particularly care about Crime Junkie. I think that Ashley is abrasive and obnoxious, and I am bothered by her obsession with dogs over human lives, but I do think that she has some talent as a narrator. I consider podcasts to be quick and mindless entertainment, and this one no exception. I am bothered by constant calls to grovel and beg for mercy, by people who let's admit it, all jumped on a bandwagon themselves, are all after the same thing, that is fame and money, are all garnering information from each other and covering each other's cases and patting each other on the back for money and views.	20190926T050005

Slumdunder	I don’t think anything will come of the plagiarism accusations.	6	0	So, we all know that Crime Junkie was sent the cease and desist letter from the Dem-Gaz’s attorney. They were supposed to comply by September 12th, and didn’t. From searching Crime Junkie on reddit I found a couple interesting things. I found a post from Cathy Frye on another subreddit demanding a “call for action” because the Dem Gaz was no longer pursuing legal action. She even published two email addresses of people that work for the Dem Gaz, asking the people of reddit to email them and ask that they continue to pursue legal action. Aside from publishing private information of other people on reddit, I feel like the Dem Gaz has dropped the subject (Cathy had to push them to start legal action, anyway) and aren’t going to pursue it any further. Just my opinion. ETA: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimePodcasts/comments/d7jm8b/crime_junkie_plagiarism_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf The link to Cathy’s post regarding the cease and desist and email addresses.	20190922T234047

MissMouthy1	This is how you do it!	57	0	I listened to the most recent MFM pod. It's no longer my favorite, but it was a local story and I read a book on the case, so I was curious how the ladies handled it. To start off, the content creators listed the book (even spelling the name of the author) and mentioned an article from 2014. Two sources. Then, they boiled down a 300 page book and the article into a fascinating snapshot in under 30 minutes. Yes, there were some direct quotes from the book, but they cited the book and summarized the content, rather than reading verbatim. That's the minimum bar we we were all hoping Crime Junkie would meet. They don't need to dig into court document, interview victims, visit the crime scenes...just form their own opinion from more than one source and cite it. That is how it's done!	20190922T062244

The podcast is hosted by two life long best friends that actually seem like best friends, they tell two court cases an episode, each taking one. The balance between them is really good and I love them. They have always referenced their sources from the very first episode which with all the drama here is refreshing to see. I didnt realise how small of a podcast they were until recently and figured I'd give them a shout out here and hopefully yall like it as much as I do!	20190920T023122

spike0822	Why	3	0	"Its bittersweet, I got introduce to the world of podcast thru my brother, I've first got hooked on the Parcast network and i couldn't stop podcasting. I was recommended to crime junkie and I instantly love them, the way Ashley spoke, and throughout the series I've listen how much research she did and how she quit her job to focus more on the podcast. To be Frank, it's the only true crime podcast I've only listen too. Except for the Parcast Network. I set up a Google alert on the keywords, Ashley recommended on her podcast, to get notifications and I put Ashley Flowers (not creepy) and Crime Junkie and i got an alert about the allegations of plagiarism. At first i was confused, must be a mistake, but after a weeks of no response between the two parties, okay it must be mistake, okay whatever, must be jealousy because there #1 and not them. But after numerous alerts about the plagiarism, in my ""wait what"" moment, there was a podcaster name Esther Ludlow, she talked about the Juarez episode she did. So I dig up Esther Ludlow on Google music, and I got ""let's taco 'bout true crime. In the bonus episode: Crime junkies plagiarism scandal, she went on full details about how CJ episode was so similar to her episode word by word, but some words were changed or never mentioned. My job is an hour away and its a great time to listen to a podcast but i was catched up on all of my favorite podcast, so i listen to the first episode of Once upon a crime and i liked it, except for the sound effects. so i listened to another episode: Selena the queen of Tejano Music, in my mind i was like whoa, i really like this podcast. The next day i was searching for my third episode and there it was; EPISODE 087: LAST STOP: CHAPTER 4: DIANA THE HUNTER OF BUS DRIVERS AND THE MURDERED WOMEN OF JUAREZ. I dreaded this moment because i love Crime Junkies. I even pay for patreon membership fees and shop at the store for shirts. I was mentally prepared. But my heart sank because i remember exactly where i was when I first heard the CJ Juarez episode,(road trip from Buffalo to Detroit) i was like damn, I still love Crime Junkie. But i feel disappointed as a fan.. i cant look at junkie crime the same way anymore."	20190916T035850

gpelfrey16	Unpopular opinion	11	0	This is surely to be an unpopular opinion in light of recent plagiarism allegations but I’m sticking with Crime Junkie. I don’t agree with plagiarism by any means and I think they should take down the ones where plagiarism was deemed to have happened. However, I’ve tried to listen to other podcasts out there for true crime and have absolutely found none that I have liked. The podcasters either are super monotone and don’t understand how to be compelling or the series takes place over 12 episodes covering just one case. They are the absolute best at what they do and that is a 30-40 minute summary of a vast array of cases, keeping the podcast succinct and compelling and just being overall enjoyable to listen to. It’s unfortunate what they did but I hope they weather the storm and come out on the other side because this is the only true crime podcast that have made my commute to work seem quicker.	20190915T183901

lamlawindy	Common law fraud class action lawsuit for Crime Junkie plagiarism?	50	0	"I'm a criminal defense attorney and (thankfully!) only touch a civil case perhaps once a year. However, the plagiarism allegations made me wonder if there may be a cognizant claim on the part of LISTENERS who paid money to CJ via Patreon or thru some other service. The crux of the case would be common law fraud: We were convinced to pay money for original, fresh content. It turned out that it wasn't original or fresh. I'm not 100% sure such a claim would succeed, but I'd be willing to wager that -- given the mention that CJ's income from Patreon was nearing ""seven figures"" (see https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/crime-junkie-podcast-plagiarism-scandal.html), some of my colleagues in the legal field have been turning the idea over in their minds."	20190914T115047

My beef with the show is the conclusions they make about guilt or innocence having done no actual research on their own. I feel like they are hoping to find a cause celeb to make money off of like Serial, while doing no actual investigation.	20190912T020852

Sounds like a mom who decided laying her son to rest was best, wanted to give him a good last day, and buried him somewhere he won’t be disturbed.	11	0	"Mom, I know you are hurt and frustrated and I wish I had something better to say than I love you. But I don't. I've never really felt that I've belonged here. I've tried very hard to fit in, to be happy, to be good to those around me, but somehow I've always felt apart from everything. Tim helped with that for a while and maybe if Jim and I had been better I would have been okay, but everything fell apart and this time there were just too many pieces for me to pick up again. I can't take the chance of Jim hurting Tim because of my choices. So I've taken him somewhere safe. He will be well cared for and he says that he loves you. Please know that there is nothing you could have said or done that would have changed my mind. I'm sorry for the hurt and difficulties I know you're going to face. I just hope you will be able to forgive me one day. Please let Brian, Kathy, Natalie, Adam, Cara, Sydney, and Phoebe know that I do love them and it was just time for me to say goodbye. I love you mom. Amy"""	20190911T230026
HermineLovesMilo	Once Upon a Crime / Women of Juarez comparison	46	0	Apologies to those who are sick of the plagiarism discussion... but for those who are curious about Esther Ludlow's allegations against CJ, she posted a video about it, available here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtIrmuuKDJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtIrmuuKDJA). If this was posted elsewhere, I missed it. CJ pretends their goal is to generate interest in true crime, particularly cold cases. However, they won't discuss their source(s) openly during the episode and only did the bare minimum, adding links to the website, after all this brouhaha. It's so disappointing (and harmful, myopic, worrying, etc.) that CJ wants to be the SOLE source of information that their listeners have.	20190911T194033

praziquantel	Sep 9, 2019: Darlie Routier	23	0	I am not planning on listening, but thought people might want a specific place to discuss this case. I think Darlie is guilty; it’s definitely an odd case though (and really sad, those poor little boys). I personally find it interesting that this case was previously covered by Once Upon a Crime (Dec 2018), Killer Queens (July 2019), Crime and Scandal (June 2019), Redhanded (Nov 2018), My Favorite Murder (Feb 2017), among several others. It is a pretty interesting case, so I see why podcasters choose it as it’s conducive to some debate. It would be nice to see fresh material from some of these folks though.	20190909T224243

Marcwatts	Just hear me out	42	0	Unpopular opinion from what I've been seeing recently but- I'm pulling for this podcast and these girls. I listened to their new episode this morning coming into work and it was great. From what I heard Ashley refers to a crime show (I cant remember the name of) as her main source of information for whatever that's worth. I don't want to bury this show because of something that to me is still unclear and repairable. I don't think Ashley is a bad person, I think she very well could have just gotten lazy. Brit offers some quality insight in this episode too; I just picture her as a cute worry wort of a mother who is listening to these stories for the first time herself. Anywho, I just want to encourage anyone who is still listening to keep doing so if that's what they choose. I thought I should stop listening to Crime Junkie just because my Reddit community suggested that I should (It seemed like a great idea since I always keep my pitchfork handy). We can wag our finger at them all we want, I just wont turn my back on them just yet.	20190909T125516

whirlwindbanshee	What do you guys think about the allegations that Crime Junkie is buying iTunes reviews?	49	0	I came across [this](https://reddit.com/r/CrimeJunkiePodcast/comments/czlyhq/_/eyzcpxr/?context=1) comment about how CJ has more 5 star reviews then JRE and since then they’ve only gotten more. As of this post, CJ has 122,210 reviews most of them 5 stars. This means 1,573 reviews have been added in the past two days. Meanwhile JRE has risen from the 115,706 originally quoted to 116,206 meaning only 500 reviews have been added. It’s interesting to note that MFM, a podcast that’s indisputably bigger than CJ and has been out longer has only 96k and less than a 5 star rating (4.5). JRE is #5 on Apple Podcasts, CJ is #6, and MFM is #10. Meanwhile on Stitcher JRE has 788 reviews and 5 stars, MFM has 202 and 4 stars and CJ has 105 at 4 and a half. Stitcher is probably the second or third most popular way to listen to podcasts and on their top charts JRE is #1, MFM is #2, and CJ is #10. It’s worth noting that it is harder to review on Stitcher since you can only publish reviews from a PC and the option is not available via the app like on Apple Podcasts. On Spotify, MFM is #3 and CJ is #5 and JRE does not publish on that platform. As far as I can tell there are no reviews attached to shows on Spotify. As u/praziquantel said it is possible a ten year old podcast has simply plateaued in reviews but I find it more interesting how CJ Is outperforming MFM on Apple Podcasts by such a large margin without, y’know, actually outperforming them in general. I would really like to know their overall monthly downloads but not sure where to find all that information. I think what I really find weird is how many 5 star reviews there are. If it were a 4.7 or something I would probably just shrug it off. I know it’s possible but it definitely seems weird and unlikely. it’s	20190907T064709

I fully expected them not to. I did not want CJ to benefit just by reselling. Once I got the refund, I sent money from that refund to some of the podcasters affected by the plagiarism (and got a really nice email back from one of them). I just wanted everyone to know since it may be hard to resell the ticket—sometimes businesses will help you out. Only for those of you who are no longer listening and feel upset/betrayed by CJ refusing to appropriately address their plagiarism. No shade to anyone who is still going or still listens—it’s hard to let things you love go.	20190906T212912

homemade-chopstick	Can I be honest about my time as a listener?	93	0	So I started listening to CJ a couple of months ago and binge listened to every single episode in a couple of weeks time. I would listen to it while doing chores or driving, or just as a bonding experience with my friends. At the time, it was the first podcast I ever listened to, so as a casual listener, I had no idea what their sources were or if they plagiarized anything, I just clicked a button and listened. And aside from the cringe that was Brit with the horrific acting (sure, you can write a script of how to respond but she delivers it so dryly like she’s not even trying to pretend she isn’t just reading words on paper), I really enjoyed the way Ashley supposedly told a story. I grew up (and still do) watch Crime shows and docs that have a more serious tone and I loved that it wasn’t a curse word or jokes thrown in here and there and that it was straight to the point but in an entertaining way like I was reading a well written novel. So it pains me to see half of it isn’t even her own thoughts. I thought it was a bit of an overreaction at first. Like, the truth is, there are only so many ways to tell a story. But then I saw the evidence where they lined up episodes with the uncited sources and my God, they could have changed it a little, or at least said something like “so and so stated...blah”. I wish they would apologize or at the very least acknowledge it. I want to be able to listen to down-to-earth, straight to the point semi-serious, suspenseful crime podcasts. Crime Junkies fit the bill for me. Are there any others I can try to listen to like this?	20190905T033255

I never left the group honestly because I am nosy LOL. Anyway, yesterday I decided to take a look at the post about their latest episode and to my surprise, it wasn’t solely comprised of “crazed” CJ fans. Here are some comments that I’ve copied and pasted (I know that we’re all about crediting sources here, but I obviously won’t be linking peoples personal FaceBook pages. If you are apart of the group, you can easily find these comments): “I know this will never get approved on the main feed so here goes: Hi. I am writing this because as much as it pains me I have to say goodbye. I moderate or admin numerous CJ sub-groups and I will be leaving those too. When I found CJ i felt like the creators were giving a voice to the victims and I am a crime victim. I was kidnapped as a child and I hate talking about it but for the creators to fully understand I feel like they need to know the impact their actions have on people. I felt I was supporting something unique, something for the victims like me, and something worth my time and lots of money that frankly, I don't have. Then, I learned that people I know, people I care about had their episodes lifted. It was too much. I heard the rumors at first but thought, ok maybe people are jealous and it happened first to someone I implicitly trust, then someone else, then another and now, the voices of the victims aren't being told by Crime Junkie, they're being used so you can line your pockets. It is greed! I fell for it, friends fell for it, and thousands of others are falling for it. I just wish I could get my money and time back. I was so happy to support such a ""great"" podcast I wasted hundreds of dollars on merch and sadly I don't have a patreon that pulls in thousands monthly so hundreds on merch is a lot for a girl paying off student loans from Berkeley. Oh, and also anything I contributed to your damn patreon. But, that will never happen because this whole endeavor was and is only to line the pockets of you and your families. My parting advice prior to leaving the well censored lions den, you went to college Ashley Flowers, get an original thought. I know you must have them and I'm sure your podcast would be great if you just told your own stories, thoughts, and insights. Que Será Sera” “What are some other good true crime podcasts to follow?” “So are they really not going to address the plagiarism? I just listened to the Let’s Taco’ Bout True Crime regarding Crime Junkie and it is deplorable. This is NOT JUST GOING AWAY. ???” “Can someone tell me if it’s common for the Patreon to mostly be “early” content rather than “extra” content? I started paying for it about 2 months ago thinking it would be a couple extra episodes but for at least a couple weeks it’s just an early release of the wide release episode” “Crime Junkie has gone to shit. Nothing but a money grab. Please do not ""support"" them by giving them your money.” “The only thing worse than a shitty, plagiarizing podcast are its rabid, insane, heads-in-the-sand fans. Y'all have no integrity and I feel sorry for you.” “CJ should have known it was a tone deaf move to put out a Patreon only episode with sources available only on Patreon after the things that have come to light this week. I would be happy to recommend podcasts that actually care about the victims and crimes they’re covering instead of one that is only concerned with getting peoples hard earned money. If you care about true crime and it’s victims, you won’t support Crime Junkie.” “Other, more reputable, podcasts have covered this case.” Pleasantly surprised to see some CJ fans actually holding Ash and Britt accountable on their “fan page!”"	20190904T145522
manamanope	The irony of the people who still support CJ	111	0	One the best parts of diving into true crime is finding out a bad guy has been caught and punished, right? So CJ has been caught doing a bad thing and these supposed fans of true crime are ready to brush it under the rug simply because *they value their own entertainment over justice for the victims of the plagiarism.* And before it even starts- no, plagiarism is not equal to murder or rape or the other heinous crimes covered by true crime podcasts. It is, however, an action that victimizes other people for the profit of the perpetrators. For that reason, there is absolutely no defense for choosing to continue to listen.	20190904T053640

Prior to the plagiarism scandal, one thing always irritated me about the podcast. And it wasnt the ""full body chills"", pruppets, nor the abundance of ad placement. However it was the obvious poor editing done typically at the end of an episode. Prior to learning how terrible these people are (Flowers mostly), I would listen to just about every show to the very end. And I would never fail to find disappointment typically at the end of each show, when the audio would seemingly jump back a few minutes and repeat. And it would occur just about when they were about to reveal another interesting detail to the story or worse, a conclusion. In retrospect it probably was the result of poor and hastily editing due to blatant plagiarism. But regardless It was enraging."	20190903T044724

I've had this issue for a long time and just kept listening hoping it might take a back seat. The whole ""be rude, be weird, stay alive"" thing was really cute & quirky at first but the more I listen and the more I look at their Facebook group I honestly get concerned. The Facebook group is filled with people being paranoid about people being friendly or simply shopping in a grocery store. They are filled with people over worrying and constantly in fear. I understand watching your surroundings and being aware but I feel like they seriously teaching people to be so anxious. I have a generalized anxiety disorder, it's taken years of therapy to work out not being afraid of everything. I just am worried they are creating all this fear just for a little bit of fame. Just wondering if anyone else felt this way. I just can't stand those ""be weird be rude"" stories and it's why I stopped following the Facebook group."	20190829T193824
ameowa	Think logically about your Plagiarism Crusade	0	0	"Doesn't anyone think it is fucked up that Cathy Frye put a copyright on a victim's story?? You can't copyright information on a crime against a child. That is seriously messed up to think you are the only one entitled to tell the story. I would have never heard of this if it wasn't for Crime Junkies, and I wouldn't be able to share the cautionary tale with youth about getting in to personal, emotional relationships with strangers they met on the internet. Yes, she did the investigation. They should have credited her in the original publishing of the podcast. But to copyright a story about a victim that was published in a news paper? Shame on Cathy Frye. That is deeply disturbing to me. The objective of sharing stories like this is to inform, not to hoard information about an innocent victim. Think about all the other podcasts who do this. Some of the ones pointing fingers are VERY guilty of this same ""plagiarism"". Not once in the first 80 something episodes of Trace Evidence did he EVER specify what resources he was referencing in the dialogue. That Let's Taco Bout True Crime episode is absolutely ridiculous. Reading show notes on mobile is just as difficult as going to a website to see them. Putting it in the show notes that are cut off and don't work on Spotify is less accessible than on a website. Oh, and not listening to other podcasters is not something to brag about. It is just conceited and unsupportive of others in the podcasting community. The information about crimes does not belong to anyone but the victim. Just because you told the story first does not give you the right to be credited every time the story of an innocent murder victim is told. That is self promotion in the most selfish way imaginable. Oh, and I guess I plagiarized my entire university degree. Same with everyone else. Especially in presentations. Changing the wording of sentences from the source material during a presentation is exactly what Crime Junkie did. Did you stop mid presentation to quote the source? If not, you're guilty too. Shame on you!! Same with all of those plagiarists who teach children about safety, health, and abuse. I mean THEY didn't do the research or write the material. I think people forget that how they did things is how every presentation, TV show, documentary, and news segment is written. It isn't a novel concept to merely reference ""a Reddit post"" or ""podcast"" in passing during spoken dialogue. What would have caused even more problems is if they called out a Reddit name publically or referenced published material without consent. There is no winning. That is why academics do shit this way. All of this just looks like a bunch of ""authors"" who are getting butt hurt someone referenced their material in dialogue without giving them a free shout out on a podcast that is far more popular and reaches a greater audience than theirs. Podcasters and news journalists do not own the stories of victims. That is just fucked up and disturbing to assert that. Guess we better start citing every single archeologist/anthropologist/psychologists who ""investigated"" facts we accept as common knowledge during posts and conversations. Don't be talking about Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, or BTK without citing the original journalist in dialogue please. You'd be doing what Crime Junkie did. Oh, and don't you DARE use the term serial killer without citing Ressler."	20190829T190035

Since it was my favorite podcast, I set out to find a new true crime podcast and I HIGHLY recommend Morbid: A True Crime Podcast. I listen on Spotify and the two ladies that do the podcast are hilarious and very entertaining. The back and forth between them is real and not just fake-ass reactions. That was probably my least favorite part of the CJ podcast. Britt's fake reactions and her gasps like she's legitimately surprised. Anyway, Morbid's episodes are long and mostly true crime with some sprinkles here and there of some paranormal or just spooky stuff.

We all know that this podcast was researched and written by Ashley. We all know the chance that she's just editing the narrative to put it in the story non verbatim. But the real reason why we love CJ is because how brilliant story teller Ashley is. She has soothing voice and engaging to listen to. Unlike any other TCP that is well researched but sounds like a robot. Now, the mere fact you created/subscribed to this sub reddit named after their pod is also a plagiarism.

Aly-mar	A very brief love affair with Crime Junkie	89	0	I discovered Crime Junkie on a trip to Alaska to visit friends who live out there in June. I had popped a an edible from the dispensary and was in the passenger seat ready for a ride from Homer to Seward. My friend who was driving suggested we listen to Crime Junkie because she wanted to catch up on the last few episodes. I was the one who introduced her to true crime podcasts a while back and we always have fun discussing them. We listened to a few episodes and I was really digging the girl duo who spoke out a lot about female safety and victim advocacy. It seemed like Ashley was really working to be involved in getting justice for victims. I was hooked. I binge listened to their catalog of about 100 episodes in about a month timespan. Then I subscribed to Patreon. Looking back, I’m pretty annoyed with myself for being fooled by them. I thought multiple times while listening “what book? What article? Why aren’t you letting your listeners know what source it was?” It was always them saying “there’s not much out there about this case, I think I found this in one of the few articles out there.” I should have known. The reason Ashley flows so seamlessly through the show is because she’s literally lying, cheating and stealing her way to the top of the podcast charts. She is stealing material from multiple talented and well researched authors and podcasters out there, and wrapping it all up in a bow for her listeners and presenting it as her own. I tried commenting about it in the Patreon group the day I was going to end my patronage, the fans in the group were CONGRATULATING THEM for rising above the haters and saying to keep doing what they’ve been doing and their show is awesome and the other shows are just jealous. I am horrified by the crime junkie community. These women stole work from people, shamelessly, and the fans are writing post after post about how they didn’t plagiarize and everyone in true crime just copies each other and they’re just being attacked because of how big they have gotten. This is just not true!! If you haven’t, definitely listen to the Let’s Taco bout Crime podcast episode by some of the podcasters who had their work stolen by Ashley and Brit. My blood was BOILING the entire time I was listening. It made me even more mad at CJ than I already was. They are complete frauds and it is such a shame that they didn’t put in the work to deliver authentic content or GIVE THE CREDIT WHERE THE CREDIT IS DUE. The amount of times Ashley makes statements as though they were her thoughts and ideas is baffling. She has been fully plagiarizing from others, verbatim, thoughts, ideas, and she does not deserve to be listened to anymore. I have subscribed to Trace Evidence, The Trail Went Cold And Once Upon a Crime over the last couple weeks since discovering them after the scandal. Maybe I would have discovered them sooner if Crime Junkies has cited them in the first place!! They are actually doing the research and have created original content that consists of their thoughts. Some of the cases they cover have barely gotten any attention. The Lets Taco bout Crime episode was great and necessary for my thought process because I learned more about their processes in creating their content and it was really interesting to know about while trying to digest how this happened with Crime Junkie. These are the shows they deserve our patronage. There are also countless others who have been plagiarized by Crime Junkie as well but they have kept quiet because it really is just a huge risk of the repercussions in a scandal like this, especially when they clearly aren’t suffering any consequences, nor have they apologized at all. I unsubscribed from everything involved with Crime Junkie and truly hope they face some actual consequences, or at least, apologize and just try to be better and not steal people’s work. I also really do not appreciate how passive aggressive they treat their fans who ask them questions in their Patreon group. These girls have serious attitudes and are completely ungrateful. I should have noticed all of the red flags in my brief love affair with CJ.	20190829T040101

_c4rli3	How much do you guys think Brit is involved in all this drama?	39	0	These are just my thoughts based on how little Brit talks in the show other than her “full body chills” and “wait what” throw-ins. But if Ashley apparently is the one that does all this “research”, how much involvement do you think Brit has in this plagiarism? I’m wondering if this is all just Ashley’s doing and Brit is getting unfairly put under fire for it? What do you guys think? (I’m in no way taking any side here. I can’t stand the plagiarism and have unsubscribed. I’m just wondering what others are thinking.)	20190828T153250
lmj2347	So we know about the plagiarism scandal. What do you think Ashley and Brit should do next?	20	0	Come out and fess up and apologize? Ignore it as they have been? End their podcast?

WordWizard01	Devil's Advocate: Does failing to cite sources really matter in the grand scheme of things?	0	0	I understand that the podcast is lacking on many fronts. Brit could contribute so much more if they simply had real dialogue about cases. Ashley could learn to pronounce things better. Also, Brit could say her last damn name like a normal human in the intro. Let's get honest about the situation. I think its COMPLETELY unreasonable to expect her to create original work product for a new case EVERY week. I agree that lifting whole lines of text without reference to the author is dirty but it's kinda to be expected. If Ashley had to go investigate each case, using only her original work, there would not be a podcast. It's free entertainment... stop bitching about it. The only person that has a right to complain is the person(s) she lifted work from... Should they be paid? That really is not for us to decide.	20190828T123512

She is a professional adult who talks like a spoiled 16 yr old girl you may pass by at the mall. If she didn't speak at all and just produced the pod it would take nothing away from the show.

mapo69	I unsubscribed	99	0	This used to be one of my favorite crime podcasts! I always thought Brit was a weird and annoying addition to the show because she always added irrelevant questions and commentary, but without that I found this show SO captivating. I had to unsubscribe tho. It was a tough choice but I can’t support plagiarizers. I get that they’re trying to change course now but it shouldn’t have happened in the first place. It’s not hard to say “I got this from ______” If it were one small part or one episode it could be excused as an honest mistake but they clearly KNEW what they were doing and kept at it. They have profited off the hard work of real people and are not rectifying that. I don’t see them offering any monetary reimbursements to the people who ACTUALLY wrote their episodes Until/unless they were to do this, I’ll have to pass on this podcast. It’s too bad	20190826T135321

exxperimentt626	Ashley always saying to never trust anyone because you never really know them while stealing others’ work reminds me of how Ted Bundy walked his coworker to her car every night because “you never know who’s out there.”	8	0	Edit: Sorry, let me explain. I’m not comparing the two in terms of severity. I just thought it was interesting how this serial killer wanted to protect his coworker from “who’s out there” because he knew who was out there (people like him) and Ashley kept saying never trust anybody like how we probably shouldn’t have trusted her when she said she did all that research. I know a lot of people interested in true crime also like interesting “connections” so to speak. I in no way want to make it seem like they are anywhere close to the same level. It’s just what o thought of when people kept mentioning Ashley’s you never truly know anyone line.	20190821T233654

crimescenetoday	True Crime from Real Homicide Detectives and CSI's	8	0	I have been in law enforcement for 28 years and 13 of that in Homicide and Crime Scene. It always surprises me how much people love to hear what we do for a living. I have loved my job and considering how many podcasts and shows there are about crime others that are not in that line of work are intrigued. It does not surprise me that many true crime podcasts are retelling stories because they are not their stories. Some do some great research to tell the story and sadly some do basic research and don't quote sources. I created a podcast to talk about current and future issues facing law enforcement, crime scene, and forensics. The people on the podcast are subject matter experts. On occasion we also present cases. We don't have to do research, they are our cases. We were the detectives and CSI's that handled the case. If you have an interest in true crime from those who do it every day, come join us. [www.crimescenetoday.com](https://www.crimescenetoday.com) we are on iTunes, Google, Spotify and just about all the podcasts locations. When we broadcast from the live radio show we also are on our youtube and facebook live. If there is something you want to see or hear about let me know.	20190818T234233
48phoenix	No mention of the plagiarism scandal on this week’s episode (but more reminders that you “never know anyone”)	76	0	I was a patron of CJ but in solidarity with podcasters and local journalists who have come forward to say their work was ripped off, I canceled my subscription (but still have access to the Patreon until Sept. 1). Tomorrow’s episode was posted today on Patreon and includes no references to the scandal that I heard (I played the first few minutes until they got into the story and last few minutes after the story had finished). They opened the episode by saying you “never know anyone,” and then got into the serial killer story. They closed with a Pruppet of the Month segment (which I’ve always taken issue with because I find it slightly inappropriate to go from talking about victims of heinous crimes to talking in cutesy baby voices about “pruppets”) Though I assume they prepare episodes weeks in advance, I had hoped they might go in to edit and add a short few minutes addressing the scandal to the episode set for wide release tomorrow. Extremely disappointed. I enjoy listening to stories of true crime, but want to have my money support those who are actually doing the work.	20190818T232343

meowingtonsmistress	I am surprised that so many people are surprised	202	0	Like many other Crime Junkie listeners, I am obsessed with anything true crime. I follow several podcasts, read true crime novels, news stories, etc. It has always been obvious to me that Crime Junkie was not well researched and relied on mainstream sources for its content. Many times Brit will ask one of her questions like “did they ever interview the neighbor” and Ashley will respond with “the article I read didn’t mention that.” They probably should be actually crediting the actual author who did the work. But it is not really secret that their podcast is pretty shallow in terms of facts about the actual case. You really can’t do a deep dive in any criminal case, let alone a murder or disappearance in 30 minutes. The podcast is much more about Ashley condensing a case into 30 minutes and telling it to the viewers. I never got the sense they reviewed trial transcripts, evidence or spoke to people involved in the case (witnesses, detectives, lawyers, etc) like other real investigative true crime podcasts. To me it was always pretty obvious they googled news stories and reddit and never really had any inside track to the cases. They could have done a better job being explicit about it, but anyone who has ever followed any of the cases they have covered knows they are pretty basic and light on details.	20190818T172910

I was a little uneasy about the $50 ticket but I've only ever seen one other podcast live (And That's Why We Drink) which has a much smaller following so I wasn't sure what a normal podcast show ticket price was.

Now these proven allegations of plagerism and apparent buying of downloads/reviews. I really don't want to go to their show and I want my money back.

grayareapod	Your help in assembling plagiarism evidence -- link to Google spreadsheet	74	0	"Hello Reddit! I've been conducting an investigation into the Crime Junkie plagiarism charges. I feel that it's important to have concrete and airtight evidence for a matter this serious. The purpose here is to identify the pattern and present incontrovertible evidence so that the transgressor stops the behavior -- in this case, Ashley Flowers profiting to the estimated tune of six figures from the hard work of so many journalists and podcasters who have labored mightily to tell true crime stories, often sifting through public records and, as Miss Frye pointed out, taking the time to earn the trust of interview subjects -- much of it mentioned in moonagedaydream\_'s post. First off, I want to thank some of you for being of great help in identifying instances of plagiarism. I have done my best to credit the original sources, along with the people who discovered those sources. Some of you have suggested instances of plagiarism that have occurred and I'm hoping that you can pass the specifics onto me so that I can corroborate and update the spreadsheet further. There's a lot to sift through and I don't want anybody to have to duplicate efforts. From what I can gather, the serial plagiarism started sometime around Episode 25, roughly around the time that Flowers adopted her ""gushing amateur from Indianapolis"" persona, which was much different from the more natural version of herself in the early episodes. A link to what others have found so far, along with my own efforts can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSPMxlERUwXpR6bHGUfh1eTLEFVb2QUH6u4o1t4yBJMXjI3Gz5mGr9eBvanpzKhsL4GlqU74RsDWZvs/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSPMxlERUwXpR6bHGUfh1eTLEFVb2QUH6u4o1t4yBJMXjI3Gz5mGr9eBvanpzKhsL4GlqU74RsDWZvs/pubhtml) I've also downloaded all of the 88 episodes currently online so that Ashley Flowers can't get away with deleting any further episodes that expose her plagiarism. You can find that mirror here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mN8GOMY7DeXDRlCX0Z7SX\_dKoeDXY2Mb](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mN8GOMY7DeXDRlCX0Z7SX_dKoeDXY2Mb) Feel free to get in touch with me or leave a comment on this thread if you have anything you've discovered that you'd like me to add. Anonymity is completely respected and I am happy to chat with anyone off the record. Thanks in advance for any help you can offer here."	20190818T112712

moonagedaydream_	A crime writer’s perspective on this whole thing	243	0	I’m a crime reporter who wants to offer some perspective on the plagiarism allegations. Many people who listen to Crime Junkie are fans of true crime, but aren’t researchers themselves, so they may not understand what goes into investigating or why CJ stealing content is such a big deal. So here’s the behind the scenes look at what goes into reporting. In most cases, there’s general information and details publicly available that’s easy to get. Stuff like that is normally sent out by cops in a news release or shared at a press conference. Oftentimes they’ll only release basic details. Those basic details are what you’ll see all news outlets reporting and is oftentimes considered common knowledge. It takes time, effort and money to find out more, unique information. There is one story I’ve been reporting on for the last year. It requires constant trips to the clerk’s office checking on documents, hours spent in court rooms listening to hearings, FOIAs filed to get information from all the agencies involved, and then time to read, understand and piece together everything I have. It’s a time-consuming and tiresome process to read through hundreds of documents, but it’s what it takes to tell a story and keep readers updated as the case progresses. None of this is free. It costs money to produce the story and most of the time, the documents cost money too, and agencies will charge you ridiculous amounts at times unless you push back. The story I’ve worked on over the last year has taken me 75 hours (at least) to report. When you combine that with the cost of documents and other reporting costs, it has cost my company over $1,200 for me to tell the story, and that’s not including the five day trial that’s coming up in the next few months. If someone took my original, copyrighted reporting and didn’t credit my organization for the unique information, and then proceeded to profit off their theft, I’d be crushed. And angry. I’ve had it happen before, where people will copy and paste my whole story to their site, and it’s frustrating to get it removed and sorted out, and normally requires our company attorney getting involved, which costs more money. I understand CJ isn’t “professional” journalism, but that’s no excuse for what they’ve done. Maybe I’m shouting into the void here, but I thought it might give some perspective on what goes into research and why some people are so frustrated by CJ. It’s not that anyone wants to keep CJ out of the true crime reporting world, but if they’re going to be part of it, they need to be responsible and ethical.	20190818T022814
Slumdunder	Help.	53	0	I saw a man (a MAN!) look at me super weird while I was in the parking lot. There’s no way he was looking at the car accident behind me, he was looking at me, and he was going to kidnap me. I called 911 and reported him as a sex offender, then took a picture of him and posted it all over Facebook with a lengthy story of how I survived an impending attack. I am a hero. I just know I saved countless women, including myself, today. /s. Leaving the Facebook group. Dear God. I wanted to stick it out to see the fallout from the plagiarism accusations, but I literally can’t anymore. End rant.	20190818T014215

cauliflowerbowl	Any other podcasts that are similar?	25	0	So I just started listening to this at work, it has made my workday ALOT better as I am a data analyst and it can get so boring. I’ve listened to 15 episodes in like 3 days but read about their plagiarism and do not want to support that. I’m not a big fan of big serial killer stories as those give me anxiety from how gruesome they are.

jellykones529	You know what really bothers me about this whole thing?	157	0	I’m an educator and plagiarism is absolutely a no-go from me. I do understand that sometimes it’s hard to re-word facts of a case and that sometimes it ends up sounding much like what was originally written, even if you feel like you said it in a different way. I GET IT. We’ve all been there. We are all human. We make mistakes. But the thing that really gets me is the cavalier attitude of many listeners and of Ashley and Brit themselves (honestly, IMO Brit is a casualty in all of this since I think Ashley has been pretty vocal about doing the research and writing the scripts and Brit has always seemed to ride her coattails) about the seriousness of plagiarism and the absolute disregard that they could ever do anything wrong. What a testament to their characters this is! To not be humble enough to say “Yeah, you’re right, we fucked up and we’re sorry. Please accept our sincerest apology and we will try to be better”...I am having a really hard time getting past that. I was pretty surprised at all of the allegations over the last few days but probably could’ve gotten past it if they didn’t post that fucking picture this morning with the crown and conspiracy theories with that stupid fucking caption. Grow up. Stop being defensive, stop pretending like you can do nothing wrong, accept responsibility for your actions. You are acting like the 9 year olds that I teach and you are in your 30’s. Grow the fuck up.	20190817T035018

anonymous	I actually still like the podcast	8	0	I’m not trying to be sensational. Just share solidarity w those who are watching this stuff happen but find it extremely forgivable and still enjoying the podcast. I’m now relistening to the episodes from beginning to end. Maybe it’s because I prefer more casual podcasts but I’m pretty sure all the podcasts I listen to borrow from/incorrectly site/“plagiarize” other podcasts, and other media and it doesn’t necessarily bother me or even get acknowledged by their fan group because everyone mutually understands that we listen to the content to hear these particular people tell me the information that someone else created. Right? They are all. Literally. Just repeating other sources’ information because that’s what true crime reporting is? If the information is identical it’s because it’s probably just the truth? Does this sound stupid? Like. It is what happened. You find out what happened from *other* people recording it. The narrative should be pretty much the same from report to report. No? If it’s accurate, it should stay the same when people repeat it. They also site their sources better than many others do. All the podcasts make money off their content. If you listen to all the episodes about the jon benet case across multiplied podcast, it will be *pretty* similar, as it should be. I’m not sure when we started holding podcast hosts to the standards of perfect beings but maybe chill out ? Edit- strange to be in the minority here when this is a fan discord lol	20190816T231430

HeHateMe201i	Why I'm Unsubscribing From CJ	133	0	After reading the Variety article on CJ, detailing the absurd amount of money they have made off the backs of victims and stolen content, I've decided to unsubscribe from the podcast. The statement they released shows zero remorse or accountability for something that was obviously intentionally done to kickstart their show. This isn't some small production being done in a closet or living room. This show is run by someone, who has an agent, and knows exactly what they are doing. There are too many great, hard working podcasters/journalists who need the downloads and listens. Those who have worked years on investigations, only to have their work be plagerised into a 30 minute CJ episode for Patraeon donations. Please consider where you spend your time, and potentially (Patraeon) money.

animeballet	Kacie Woody	101	0	Okay, so I’ve seen all the accusations of plagiarism. I decided to wait and see what happens. But today I wanted to look at the sources of the accusations. I just realized that one of the biggest accusations of plagiarism is on the Kacie Woody episode. I just went to look, and sure enough, it’s been deleted. But here’s my issue.... I know a lot of people here hate it, but that episode had a pruppet of the month... and it was my dog who we had to put down. I’m absolutely crushed. I can’t find it anywhere. I know it’s kind of stupid, but it was the last little thing I had to be proud of my dog. That sucker punched me in the gut for sure. I’m tempted to reach out to them and ask where the episode is... and see what happens. This situation sucks for everyone who truly loved their podcast.	20190815T172958

anonymous	Facebook Group Rant	53	0	"I joined the Crime Junkie Podcast Facebook group a couple weeks ago because a friend was sending me screenshots of posts made there concerning the Ally Kostial case. I'm an Ole Miss alumna, my sister is a current student there, and I ""know of"" people who are connected to the case. I've listened to CJ casually for a few months, so was curious enough about what was being said in these posts to join the official group. Oh.my.gosh. It made me think I was the only rational, normal human who listened to the podcast. Until I came to this subreddit and saw some users commenting the same thing. The obsession there is ridiculous. I can't help but think it's a lot of stay-at-home moms who conduct their own ""groundbreaking"" research on true crime cases to feel some semblance of higher intelligence and purpose. The posts are ridiculous, the comments are ridiculous, you are not an elite crime investigator. Ok. Sorry. Rant over."	20190815T155553

anonymous	Essentially	41	0	They’re number one because Ashley is an incredibly enthusiastic reader and they regifted true crime stories in the most sellable packaging? Seriously. Off the bat, first time I noticed them, it was as if they took everything that made mfm popular (animals, cliches, two pals obsessing on true crime) and blast it out there/make as much money before people noticed. I mean, come on. Pruppets and “merch” was totally $hameless. And, why not. All these other true crime podcasts are wasting time trying to be witty with new titles, their own spin, and/or other edgy attributes and never hitting the charts. Why is anyone else even trying when all it took was a cute little bow and really smooth voice. What’s always bothered me more than the plagiarism and thirst, is the inaccuracy and bias on wrongful conviction episodes. I hope this hurts their reputation or at least the MErCH sales/live show sales.	20190815T134529

honeytummy	podcasts similar to cj?	42	0	hey everyone! the news surrounding crime junkie's plagiarizing has really turned me off, especially after reading threads here with links and sources to show that there is substance in these accusations against them. so thank you for opening my eyes about that. i got rid of my patreon 2 months ago because they weren't really uploading any special patreon content like....at all. idk what happened but it feels like they just completely abandoned their patreon content, and i don't really care for getting an episode on sunday rather than monday for the $10 price. SO! that leads me to ask, what are some other podcasts similar to cj where i can get my fix of FACTUAL and NON-PLAGIARIZED true crime???	20190814T134158

brandicaroline	Why are y’all so angry?	221	0	I came to this subreddit because I recently was introduced to Crime Junkie. I LOVE the podcast and have been packing/renovating my house in the process of moving, so I’ve been listening to a lot while working. So, I thought, I’ll see if there’s a subreddit of fans! Then I arrive here. And of all the posts, it’s like 10% are about the actual episodes and discussions about the crimes, and the rest... are all people bitching about Brit! Seriously? She’s a producer of the show, and her and Ashley are best friends. For a lot of podcasts, you don’t even hear the producers and they don’t provide input. Probably because Ashley is the host and Brit is the producer, Ashley presents it as a story and Brit is reacting while doing her “producer” thing. Ashley is obviously the host. It’s a story being told, are you telling me that you don’t gasp when someone tells you a similar story? Or repeat what was said to illustrate how crazy it is? Are there really so many people listening to Crime Junkies just looking for reasons to get pissed off? Maybe I’m just naive and a noob to this community, but man. Why’re y’all so angry?	20190811T172737

Shell2k6	Can't place an episode	7	0	Hi, I'm looking for an episode I cant find. I've been through the episodes on the website and feel like in going crazy so hoping someone can help me out. I can't remember the guys name or where he went missing from but a guy drove his car up a side access road into a heavily wooded area. I'm pretty sure the car as well as the guy has never been found. There were over 700 aerial images taken of the area and these led to his baseball cap being found by someone noticing a red mark on one of the photos. Ashley says to have a look and see if you can spot anything but to start mid way through the images as most people give up after a couple hundred. I'm sure it's this episode where Ashley says about never waiting to talk to someone when they have something to tell you. Maybe the if you have a secret tell it to someone. As he phoned someone and said he needed to tell them something but the person was working/busy at the time and it was the last time they ever got to speak to him. Me and my partner are both listening to crime junkies and I told him about this episode but he said his gone past where I am and still hasn't heard it. I thought it was bryce laspisa, but its not that episode. I've just mixed up the two. Anyone have any ideas or a name for me of the guy that's missing or an episode number. Or even a link to the crime junkies page that shows the picture of where he was last thought to be and provides the link to the aerial images. Thanks	20190807T150213

Richmond lied about talking to her the night she went missing. If Richmond was involved and she knew, she could have been blackmailing Richmond, which would sure be a strong motive for Richmond. Further, the manner in which her car was found is not consistent with someone who is trying to convince people you are dead so you can “disappear yourself”.	20190724T030942

morrisonlikessamoyed	The week's episode - Alice Crimmins	25	0	"To start with, I loved it. I am very grateful to both Ash & Brit for making it so long & I must point out the quantity did not affect the quality. It was well-researched and well presented. Now to the case. I haven't looked it up online myself yet, except the photos on their website. So this outlook will be solely based on what I heard in the podcast. *Alice* I do not believe Alice had anything to do with her children's kidnapping or death. Given how biased the investigators were, they hardly looked at the other possible suspects. She didn't show any sign of wanting to get rid of the kids. She even diligently fought for the custody. No evidence or reasons to show the kids were unhappy. Maybe she did go out more than usual for a mother but she was in her 20s so maybe that's a reason. *Eddie* sounded like somewhat deranged in his behaviour, obsessed with Alice, spying on her, creepily listening to Alice & her partner in their intimate moments.. Nope that doesn't sound like a normal man. He exposed himself to a little girl? I don't know what the context of the situation was? Was it intentional, did he expose himself accidentally (as in he was peeing in the park or something & turned around to talk to the girl...)Whatever the case, he doesn't sound like he was doing well with the separation. First Alice was going out with other men & then there was the custody battle which by the sounds of it, was in Alice's favour. Eddie could have definitely taken the kids away ('if I can't be happy with a family & kids, nor can Alice'.. Kind of mentality), a heat of the moment action, when intoxicated (gin and tonic) and eventually he realised what he had done & kept on insisting Alice was a wonderful mother & would never hurt the kids. Probably he took the kids through the window (the kids would comply given it's their dad) & hence he kept insisting he saw undisturbed dust to prove that the kids didn't leave through the window. Spur of the moment I say 'cause perhaps he was again creeping in on the house, drunk, saw the stroller, he knew about the loose screen & decided to act on it. The kids weren't sexually assaulted, not supposedly tortured, strangulation seems to be the commonest methods used by parents to kill their kids. To me Eddie looks like a good candidate. *Joe* is a very likely suspect too from what I heard in the podcast. A lone alcoholic loser, rejected by Alice that night by using her kids as an excuse could ignite a rage against them. Now the episode did mention they looked into other possible suspects, so I would guess they have a good reason to rule him out. However given how persistent the prosecutors were in painting Alice the culprit that they used him to testify against her & how willingly Joe obliged sounds fishy at the least. *The creepy burgler*. Very plausible by the sounds of it & with no other info about him I can't say anything more. *The mentality challenged teenager*. This is a 40/60 for me. Maybe he did do it. He is known to wander around at night. He did confess. His behavior did change following the accident. However, it also sounds strange. Did he have history of unusual /violent behavior in the past? What kind of mental illness did he have? Did he show irrational tanturms or rage on occasions? It sounds weak that a kid like him would manage to sneak the kids out in the night without making a noise (as if completely knowing what he was doing like a normal person) unless the kids knew & liked him. We don't hear anything like that. Maybe he did see something. Even had a confrontation that night when he sneaked out. He was threatened. That could explain the events that followed... He did feel guilty & was too scared. *Sophie* sounds like a busy body, saw an opportunity for local fame & tried to make the most of it. The couple with kids & a dog that night do sound legit & I don't think they had the conversation that Sophie described ( M-""Come fast""... W-""We need to keep quiet!"") If they wanted to keep quiet, they would probably talk softly, & Sophie wouldn't be able to hear that from a higher storey... Overall, my take is, Alice was wrongfully charged. The real culprit walked free. Given how the prosecutor skewed every data, made the coroner give a false report, tried to manipulate the jury by making Alice look like a horrible mother & a horrible woman in general really point to how they just cared about one thing. Not to find the murder(s) but to make Alice their convicted murder."	20190708T113350
SarcasticJerck	Today's Episode...Alice Crimmins	149	0	This episode is excellent. Well researched. Over an hour long. No ads yet (over 45 minutes in). Brit's banter is normal and not weird. This is the kind of episode that we've been asking for. Thanks Ash and Brit	20190708T090717

I'm really bummed because they ended E2 with so many open questions. Was this episode taken offline or is this a temporary problem? Any info? Thank you!	20190706T111052

morrisonlikessamoyed	A good episode after a while.	12	0	The lastest episode on the Sumter county does was a good one after a long long time. The last one I loved was Sneha Philips. The ones in between were good but none in the standards of Crime Junkie. I love the unusual cases they cover (cue Robert Wong, Asha Degree, Oklahoma girl scouts, Zachary Bernhardt, Colleen Osborn, Katelin Akens to name a few). Lately they have been busy with tours and live shows and their regular episodes didn't feel upto the per, they were short and the cases were really not that interesting (meaning no offense to the victims or anyone else). Maybe it's because they try to make something ordinary sound exciting or scary. However I loved their latest episode on the Sumter County does and hope they will work on similar strange cases. Ps I love Crimejunkie and how they actively try to provide awareness and make an effort in solving cold cases and I am very fond of their Pruppet segment too. I am a follower from outside the US and this podcast is still my favorite and wouldn't want that to change.	20190702T155530

I wanted to shed light to this great program that is happening in my small city of 70,000. The first inmate job fair was held. While I argue that some cases should focused on punishments rather than rehabilitation, eventually those who are given parole are more likely to fall back into their old ways without a support system. This is another post that I'd like to have a discussion with everyone one day.

Eventually, I gave up and just quit the group overall. I rejoined about 3 months ago and again, my content is never published. No explanation, barely any tagging on the already-been-published articles. I'm very frustrated just because I feel like my voice is not being heard. Next, the things they do post (instead of my small town news) are things very uh, ridiculous imo. Not everyone in this group has ""almost escaped death"" or whatever. The stories posted are just half paranoia, half dumb situations. Otherwise, it's just merchandise and about dogs. I thought this group was supposed to pitch ideas, theories, and get a community together about crime and helping, while in reality it is more like a gossip group. I'm over it."	20190618T210849
Buttapecan	Losing interest	60	0	I was “hooked” awhile ago and binged from the beginning to now. But now I can barely finish the last couple of episodes. The context is so lackluster. I feel as if Ashley is just reading off a page instead of actually telling us a story. The story of the victim(s) life and what they went through. Wether is was a murder or someone who vanished. I use to be swept away in her storytelling and I could even picture what was happening. I could feel the story. My emotions have gone from surprised to disgusted to sad and to angry. I am emotionally vested in some of these stories. And these are not just stories! This is real life. I will never forget the Austin Yogurt Shop victims. All those poor girls. And I’ll never stop thinking about Asha Degree. Where is she? What happened to her? I really hope Ashley gets back to the real reason why we were and are all so invested in this show, because it matters.	20190618T004318

The episodes have been pretty lackluster, and for the first time ever I stopped listening before the episode was over today because I was bored and had no idea why Ashley split this story into two parts. I’m not super up to speed on their personal lives and how busy they are but it’s almost strange how their podcast has gotten more popular and it seems like they’re putting less effort into their episodes? I would 100% be happier with bi-weekly episodes that are longer and have more thought put into them. Obviously love and respect the work they do but you can’t ask me to rate your podcast five stars and give me three star content. I feel like something they have mentioned several times is avoiding doing stories that have been done already by others, but at what point do they abandon that? I don’t really care if a story has been covered already or not because I like to hear the way THEY tell it, at least most of the time...the story about North Fox Island was one of the first stories ever told on MFM and I was excited to hear more but really sad when I was bored throughout the entire thing.

loganbee6	am i the only one who really doesn’t like their use of the word “junkie”?	10	0	as a real-life junkie (recovering meth addict) i really don’t like people tossing around the word “junkie”. a junkie isn’t a person who’s just interested in something.... it’s someone who literally ruined their life because of a disease. it’s just incredibly frustrating to me to hear two women toss it around and laugh about being “junkies”. it’s disrespectful and insensitive coming from two women who claim to be so socially conscious edit: i’m now seeing i didn’t originally state my point quite accurately: this use of the term feels disrespectful coming from two women who try to voice the stories of the voiceless and advocate for marginalized and stigmatized communities. it’s a word with multiple meanings, one of which is very insulting to some people, being used trivially. i do have a bias when it comes to this, as i’ve been called a junkie countless times and it’s only been used to belittle me and others, but bias and impact seem like something that would’ve been taken into account	20190607T215541

ameowa	I think Ashley did an awesome job on the two part episode on the North Fox Island and Oakland County Child Killer.	33	0	It was weird without Brit in the episodes, but I think it was very well done. It brought light to an issue that is still ongoing to this day. Hopefully it spreads awareness to the prevalence of groups engaging in child sexual abuse, and the lack of convictions when they are caught. I am in Canada and the convictions are hardly slaps on the wrist. You shouldn't be able to buy your way out of a conviction, nor should people abuse their positions of power to let others get away with crimes against children. We need to hold people in positions of power accountable for their involvement in illicit activities.	20190604T201350

PM__ME__SURPRISES	Problem loading the podcast	2	0	So I listen to the show on a computer at work, not on a phone if that matters. On every platform they have the show (I've tried spotify, stitcher, podbean, etc. theres lots of places its available), it is a hit or miss whether the episode actually loads and plays for me. When I hit the play button, it will either start playing immediately or be completely unresponsive. I'll refresh a few times, wait around 5-10 min and try again and sometimes it works, sometimes it's still unresponsive. Even when it's working, if I pause the episode to go to the bathroom or go to a meeting or even just for two seconds to stop to talk to someone walking by my desk, it will sometimes go back to being completely unresponsive. I really like the show but this issue happens every time I try to listen and I have to fight with the player to get it to work. Anyone else have this issue? It must be an issue with wherever they host the files because regardless of what podcast site I try to listen to it on, it has the same problem.	20190523T191536

Officer_Sardonic	Did anyone think today’s episode was kind of boring?	17	0	It just seemed like a super obvious case. No interesting twists or anything, like the cases they usually do.

Sarchast	Short Episode & a rant...	20	0	Seems like the girls are phoning it in lately. Super short episode this week (about a half hour) and not a ton of detail - I dont mind them taking next week off so much - hell, I'm taking a vacation from my job and they deserve one too. Having said that... (rant time) I listen to a few other podcasts and I noticed that they usually spend a few minutes thanking the patreon supporters and some list them by name (I dont listen to that part) and one or two of them really spend a LOT of time thanking patreons and telling them how great they are and thanks and love and gush and bubble. Ash and Brit say... If you want more content, join the fan club. If you want to see what you're missing from not joining the fan club, go to the page and then join the fan club. Not one thank you or anything. I unsubbed from the patreon because of it, but maybe I'm being petty. A little thank you once in awhile can go a long way at keeping my attention.	20190520T195814

faceboobs701	Britt is Annoying.	195	0	I fully expect to catch flack for this, but I need to say it. Britt is annoying and contributes nothing of value to the podcast. Ashley's storytelling is the only reason it's worth listening to. All Britt is capable of is asking Ashley to repeat exactly what she just said, clarifying details that don't need it, and making absolutely useless observations. She just annoys me so much. I love the podcast. I think it's great. But from the beginning, Britt was just annoying and I wondered what her role was. Ashley could do this entirely by herself and probably be better off without her friends useless commentary. Sorry. I'm ranting. My boyfriend also listens to the podcast and agrees. She's just useless in this podcast and very annoying. Ugh. Edit: After making this post, I can see the CJ community handles criticism as well as Castro did.	20190425T011438
trochanter_the_great	The Kendrick Johnson case	38	0	I'm pretty frustrated with them having done the case. I've been looking and looking into since it came out. I even found this great write up here on reddit about the case. As much as I like learning about conspiracies, when they go accusing people and affecting real lives, you better have some stronger evidence or look into everything. Here's a link that has tons of information and more links into the case. It tells what the family lied about, myths, etc. It's very painful to think about. This poor young man died due to an accident. A very tragic accident, but that's all it was. Edit: forgot to drop this linkhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/45div4/kendrick_johnsons_death_is_not_an_unresolved/ Edit 2: I made a comment on their patreon about my disappointment and they deleted my comment.

Slumdunder	Anyone have an experience with someone that could be on Crime Junkies?	39	0	"I used to work at a hotel at the front desk. It was a 60-bed hotel and there was only one person there after housekeeping left around 1 pm. One night, I was scheduled 3-11pm, and as usual, was there by myself. I noticed this guest that was walking really slow, up and down the hallway, just staring. He gave me the creeps bad enough that I locked the office door, which I usually left open because it was quicker access to the back hallway. At one point, I looked in to the pool and he had all of his clothes on, in the pool, just standing there and staring. Major creep vibes. The next morning I was scheduled to come back at 7am. Check-out time rolled around at 11 and this guy had paid cash the night before. He had only paid for one night, so in order to stay another night he had to either come down to the desk and pay with cash again or provide a credit card. I called the room around 11 and said my usual, ""checkout time is 11, if you need to stay another night you'll need to provide payment etc,"" and this guy says ""I don't know when I'm coming out again."" And me, being the snarky person I am, said ""Welp, you better make sure you come out by noon or you can't stay another night."" He comes down to pay. My shift ends. I come back the next day, cops everywhere. Guy killed his parents, very brutally from my understanding, almost decapitating them in their basement, and was hiding out at our hotel."	20190406T074141

I loved the stories, the way Ashley told them, everything! I don't know if the novelty has just worn off but I'm starting to be a little over it all. Ever since the podcast starting doing well it seems like they are mainly focused on making money, which I get, but before it seemed like they were truly trying to get cases solved and talking about lesser known cases (e.g. mentioning CrimeStoppers of Indiana, etc.) Don't get me wrong, I know a lot of work goes into making each episode but I am finding the episodes less interesting and I feel like the passion is fading in the storytelling. Not to mention, the strange ""extra"" episodes on Patreon like Brit retelling Poe's work. I feel like they are going a little off tangent and frankly, the quality of it all is declining a little.

Cody7738	Lumberton NC?	7	0	Let me just start off by saying how much this podcast means to me. My father passed away in October and your podcast has really helped me find an escape and a hobby that can keep me distracted. Never stop doing what you do, it means so much to me and has given me so much joy and I am SURE I am not the only one. Love you Ashley and Britt. Now! Into the sauce! Just wanted to make a slight suggestion to a case (or series of) that I've been following for a while. It probably isint enough for a whole episode or anything, but it's something I think a bunch of others can get sucked into. On April 17th 2017 the bodies of Christina Bennett (32) and Rhonda Jones (36) we're found within a few blocks of each other. Both bodies we're badly decomposed and found naked and gagged. With no signs of obvious injury. Jones' body was found in a trash bin (like a big recycle bin at the end of your driveway) while Bennett's body was found inside of an abandoned house nearby. Now this is enough to peak some interest because the disposal of Jones' body alone. But this is where it gets interesting. A few weeks later on June 3rd, 2017, the decomposed and naked (couldn't find anything about being gagged) body of Megan Ann Oxendine (28) was found behind an abandoned home, 3 blocks away from the bodies of Jones and Bennett. This alone isint too crazy for a town with a lot of crime and high homicide rate, but: what really makes this stick out is when the news teams were reporting on the finding of the bodies of the two previous women, Oxendine was actually INTERVIEWED by the news team where she states she KNEW Jones. I will post the news reports and interviews below. Just when the reporter says her name during the interview gives me full body chills. I cannot find any information on how Oxendine's body was discovered besides the fact she was decomposed (no reports of being naked or gagged like the previous victims) There is a lot of evidence circulating that all three of these women had a history with drug and alcohol abuse. Their autopsies came out in late 2017 and declared that none of them could have a ruled cause of death. I believe all 3 of them were actually found with traces of substances in their bodies but don't quote me on that, I cannot remember the article I saw it in. To complete this I will leave up a bit more speculation: there is now a missing girl in the area. Abby Peterson (20) September 5th 2017 within a couple of miles of the 3 women. It was reported that she told her mother she would be back to the house in about an hour that night. She was seen getting into a brown Buick and that was the last time she was seen. Now this is where speculation can begin. What would a 20 year old girl be doing out of the house at night for only an hour? This is an area where drugs are all too common. Could she have been lured into a trap with the promise of drugs? Is there a killer on the lose taking advantage of a local news station that under represents stories and a local police that is already overworked? Why does this not receive more attention? Is this way too far of a long shot? Have I gone off the deep end? Probably. Feel free to check out any of the links I will post below, and excuse me if I have forgotten anything, this is my first Reddit post of this kind. On a side note, I find it very interesting that there are no major reports until the 3rd body is found. Which makes me wonder if there may be more.

MonSterinYourKloset7	Help! Looking for an episode!	6	0	Was it crime junkie or morbid that did a case about a young woman/ teen and while they were looking for her or she was in the hospital recovering, her mom asked God to give her a sign that her daughter was okay. The mom prayed while driving that even if her daughter died she’d still praise God more than ever.	20230210T185327
BakedPotatoWithCheez	Ashley’s voice Change!!	68	0	So I just went and listened to an old episode (CONSPIRACY: Bardstown, KY.) because of some new leads the area. And WOW. I didn’t even recognize Ashley’s voice! I literally thought they let someone else remake the episode and was so confused for a hot minute!! Then I realized it was her! Anyone else notice this?? Her voice doesn’t sound the same AT ALL!! I’m assuming new better equipment has just enhanced her voice over the last year or so but wow. That change is truly wild. Editing to say: since I’m getting downvoted for no reason, just to clarify that I’m not talking shit I simply am making an OBSERVATION because I was shocked. I love Ashley & support her. I was just curious if anyone else noticed. 🙄 some of y’all need to grow tf up and stop taking things so personally. 💀	20230210T155638

Awesomnicity	Have you noticed…	1	0	So it really bothers me, but has anyone noticed that Ashley always introduces the story saying “I have for you” not “we have for you”…I know Brit was gone for a while, but she’s back!! ❤️❤️ Maybe she just got used to saying that because of doing the show for a while by herself, but when they edit, they haven’t caught that? It just bothers me. It’s a “we” not a “me” just wondering if I’m over analyzing or not even thinking of it in a rational way! 🤷‍♀️ and now that I’m typing this, I know Brit is technically listening to the story too, but they show represents both of them and I checked, old episodes have the same thing, “I have a story for you” but Brit is important too	20230202T173112

Cmccray	Suspect’s Keys Matched Victim’s Apartment	2	0	Looking for a case CJ did an episode on that I can’t find. I don’t remember much about the case but I do remember police were looking at the keys of suspects as they brought them in for questioning. LE was looking for someone who had a key to the victim’s apartment. They finally found a suspect with a matching key. He claimed and was able to prove that key actually matched his own apartment so he was released. LE figured out there were multiples of the same locks around this apartment complex so one key could unlock several doors. Ashley and Brit were stunned that an apartment would do this. This ring a bell to anyone?	20230201T012805

Sageandsmoke777	Thoughts on the family in anaqua springs?	8	0	I just got into this podcast, disclaimer. This episode threw me over the edge. The only reason I can think the following wasn’t suggested by the hosts is fear of a defamation suit by drawing too many conclusions. So, during the episode it’s noted that Charley isn’t crying with tears, texts were supposedly sent from the daughters phone about her mom talking to herself, yet the mom called her mom and then 911 multiple times while getting disconnected. How does anyone think it’s believable that she killed herself by managing to shoot herself in the head and throat? To me I think it’s obvious what happened. She cancelled her appointments, she got in a fight with charley, and she was leaving him to a different apartment while having had suggested domestic abuse interactions with him. He has a multi million dollar home they live in, and she tried to call for help To me it’s pretty point blank that Charley called a hit on her for wanting to leave, hence the perfect shot to the head for the girls and then the double shot to mom. He didn’t directly do it himself, there is no way to prove it was him. Reason it flew? Money and lawyers. Reason the dads are suing? They know he’s untouchable, and they’re trying to do what they can to bring their children justice. Anyone else draw this conclusion?	20230131T142120

She adds, NOTHING relevant to the conversation and they don't even seem to have fun chemistry. And when she says, ""Im sorry but."" GIRL. Im sure she's paid at least 6 figures, she doesn't have to apologize for doing her literal job. I don't want her to lose her income so maybe they could just give her a fake microphone like they do to kids when they want to help but you don't really want them messing something up. And im in recovery myself so Im not going to shit talk her alcoholism and call her a ""raging alcoholic"" like I've seen here and have nothing to do with how grating she is btw. Drag me if you want but its just my opinion and my opinion doesn't really mean shit so you don't have to jump on me or try to explain what value she brings. I've listened for years.."	20230125T153414

What podcasts do you turn to when you need a break from the heavy subject matter that is discussed in CJ and just want to laugh? I'll go first- I've been listening to Live, Laugh, Larceny, but I'm all caught up. They take dumb criminal arrests and tell them in funny short stories with sound effects. Just trying to see what else like-minded listeners go to for laughs.	20230124T200542

I've tried others (the most notable is probably my favourite murder, which felt too casual and ""funny"" and not really about the cases) but nothing has matched the energy i got from early episodes of crime junkie when it was about telling the story and raising awareness of lesser known cases. Can anyone make some recommendations for other crime podcasts so I don't end up listening to the same 30 episodes forever?"	20230124T191711

TheKruszer	Tiffany Valiante Case - CJ Needs to Cover This!	35	0	Crime Junkie has never covered the story of Tiffany Valiante, which was featured on Unsolved Mysteries on Netflix not all that long ago. Tiffany was hit by a train and her death was immediately classified as a suicide, but there is sooooo much that doesn't make snese with that conclusion - including why the young woman was found in her bra and underwear and with her shoes found miles away from where the train struck her. There is currently a petition on Change .org to reopen her case as a murder investigation since one was never done at the time.... I feel like this is exactly the kind of case that Ashley should be on top of - it seems Tiffany's family are very involved and I expect they'd be happy to talk. I have no idea how to get in touch with them to suggest a case for them to cover, but hopefully someone from CJ will see this. At very least, it would be important to give the petition an extra boost, as it appears there are things happening even now with her case.

anonymous	Karina Holmer, John Zewizz, and Billy Joel?	2	0	Hey all! I listened to the Karina Holmer episode about three years ago and I never understood the connection between the lyrics Ashley reads and John Zewizz. The lyrics are clearly from the Billy Joel song Zanzibar, which was popular on Tik Tok a few years ago; I got the old man’s car, I got a jazz guitar, I got a tab at Zanzibar. Ashley states that John Zewizz wrote the lyrics for a song but it always struck me as odd because I tried to find any link between the lyrics and Zewizz but I can’t find anything. There are no writing credits to Zewizz on Zanzibar and google doesn’t bring anything up when you search Zewizz and Zanzibar together. It is also strange that on the genius page for the song it says that Billy Joel wanted to write a song with the name Zanzibar but didn’t know what to write it about until a producer told him it sounded like the name of a bar. Is that just a coincidence that Zewizz was in a bar called Zanzibar and supposedly wrote lyrics for a song that also shares lyrics with Joel’s song about a bar called Zanzibar? Was this something Ashley just pulled out of thin air? Not a pressing issue, but this has been bothering me for a few years now. Any clarification is appreciated!	20230108T200741

Eatyogreennies	Phylicia Simone Barnes	24	0	I just listened to the two part podcast episodes. I have a thought. Remember how the dogs lost the scent at the parking space one space over? Who’s space was that? And then James (star witness) said that he went to the second floor to meet up with Michael, who had r*ped/k*lled her. What if James is mistaken in the person he met with (which is why phone records didn’t line up)? And the reason Phylicia didn’t have outdoor shoes on, and only her slippers, was because she went upstairs. Maybe she met this person at one of the apartment parties. Which is also why she wouldn’t need money. Perhaps this person also had the space beside Michael’s. It’s a long shot, but maybe Michael was legit a creep but not guilty.

KalmKashew	Wishing she’d trash one of the other podcasts and focus more on Crime Junkie…	75	0	This podcast is gold and quite frankly is probably what bolsters the other ones she produces up to even be listened too. I guarantee half of y’all try and listen to the other podcasts because you want to fill the hole crime junkie leaves when you are done with that weeks episode. I tried all of the other ones and they are just not the same. Wondering if I am the only one who feels this way… if I am than plz drop suggestions for very similar podcasts as crime junkie down below.	20221227T141746

sugarloaf0204	What Case Is This?	18	0	Hi all! I remember a case where a woman was opening a shop and mysteriously went missing in a 10 min window (I think she may have either had a salon or a floral shop). Something about she was on the phone with someone at one time and then her shop opened at another time and when she wasn’t there to open the doors, people knew something was wrong. Does this case sound similar to anyone? It’s driving me crazy because I can’t remember!	20221223T054411

Swimming-Pizza7928	Listening to old episodes♥️	35	0	Does anyone else ever go back and binge some of the older episodes and notice stuff you missed before?? Like I’m listening to the West Mesa Serial Killer episode and Ashley’s doing her whole crime stoppers advertisement and I’m pretty sure it’s her husband who’s playing the part of the “random person on the street who knows nothing about crime stoppers” lmao. Also she drops the f bomb in this episode and it’s so refreshing not to hear the *bleep* that’s edited in these days. Just reminiscing on my early crime junkie days. Still love all their new stuff too but there’s something about those old episodes I just can’t get enough of lol.	20221221T142601
crimejunkiefan	Anthonette Cayedito	16	0	I have soooo many questions. 1. Why were the kidnappers so sure the mother wouldn't wake up as they were banging away and calling the girls specifically to open up? Was she drugged when she was out or she was known to pass out stone cold. 2. How did the 5yo go right back to sleep after watching her sister being forcibly taken and not try to wake her mother up? Was it a false memory or she really kept such a big a secret. That is a humongous burden to carry. Did I hear right that is the reason the sisters are estranged as adults? 3. And I have sooooo much judgement for the waitress (IDC). Whoever that girl was in the diner might have been saved from whatever was happening to her.	20221221T054204

Fancy_Ad_4739	Merch Store Shipping	11	0	I ordered my very first Crime Junkie sweatshirt from the merch store last month on the 13th. Flash forward to a couple weeks ago, I realized that I hadn’t received a shipping notification or a tracking number so I went back to the website, read the fine print and saw that normal shipping was 10 to 12 days. (More popular/in demand items with a lot of orders could potentially ship later.) However, it’s been over a month and my package still says that it’s only had label created… I’m not upset or anything because I understand that packages don’t always get shipped out the day order them but have any of you guys had this issue with their merch provider? I’m just kind of bummed that I spent $60 on a hoodie and it’s been over a month and I still don’t have it. It’s getting super chilly out here and I’d love to bundle up in my new CJ sweatshirt. Update: I reached out and they gave me a carbon copy excuse that they’re behind due to holiday shipping and to not worry because a label has been created, it just hasn’t been scanned yet… it’s been well over a month. SCAN IT.	20221218T231223

But in the anniversary episode it seemed like Britt was speaking normally and in parts Ashley was sped up. Has anyone else noticed this? Maybe she’s just been talking super fast lol	20221216T044229

Over time, though, public officials started to pose a different theory: that he took his own life. But for those who knew Jonathan, that wasn’t an option – and the more they learned about the circumstances surrounding his death, the more they started to wonder if it was being covered up by those in charge.	20221215T000434

Top_Frosting_7864	I’ll probably get hate for this but…	57	0	I’m new to the podcast. I’m only a few episodes in and I’m already put off by a few things. Ashley’s lack of research is alarming. In the Karina Holmer case she gave a lot of wrong information and kept claiming there “isn’t any information out there”… when a simple google search can prove that wrong (there’s books, documentaries, podcasts, news articles etc etc). Now I’m listening to Shawn Grate and every time Brittany asks her a question she keeps saying “there no information… again, there’s no information so I can’t answer that…” so on and so forth. I understand this is the first few episodes but just curious if her research ever improves. Also… is she always this rude to Brittany? Holy smokes she talks to her like she’s dumb. Again… don’t mean to offend any super fans I’m just legitimately asking to spare myself wasted time lol TIA!	20221210T123033

MakikiLuvsYou	25 year old family coldcase	29	0	25 year old family cold case 11-22-22 I (F21) found out there was a 25 year old cold case of my 17 (almost 18) year old second cousin Kevin Gilpin. There’s is almost no media or any coverage of his case, I can only find a few news paper articals on his case. From what I can gather is in 1997 Kevin was dropped off at a pool hall by his father, after that he was never seen again his parents called the police and nothing was done- my grandmother had to file a missing persons report back then. In 2003 an Amish family had bought a farm and found a old hand dug 12ft well in the well was some remains (through DNA was found out to be Kevin) on the remains was two bags of rocks, near the well was a rock/ cinder block with a rope tied around it. There is a rumor of a friend of his calling Kevin’s paternal grandmother pretending to be Kevin but once again that is just a rumor. Please reach out to me or Russell springs KY police with any tips or leads. The squeaky wheel gets the grease so I will pick up the torch for my grandma and aunt sue and try to find justice for my cousin Kevin Lee Gilpin. Updates: Kevin’s case is now added to uncovered.com!	20221125T163027

notwhoyalookingfor	Favorite thing about newer episodes	79	0	Has anyone else noticed Ash’s willingness to call out shitty law enforcement increase over the past year or so? I’m so here for it, and love to see this use of AudioChuck’s success. Obviously there was some over the years, but it seems to have amped up this “Season of Justice.” That being said, have any The Deck listeners heard Anthony Adams case? Do you think law enforcement might have some connection to the murder, that’s why 3 LGBTQ+ murder cases are missing evidence?	20221115T143558
Realistic-Dream-4917	Crime Junkie Transcriptions	3	0	Hi, I wonder if official transcripts for CrimeJunkie exists. I'm a Musixmatch curators and I found that on their podcasts site they have all transcripts, but they are automated and contains some errors. When corrected they look pretty good, like this one: [https://podcasts.musixmatch.com/podcast/1322200189/episode/1000584561751?time=93.87](https://podcasts.musixmatch.com/podcast/1322200189/episode/1000584561751?time=93.87) I wonder if anyone from this community would like to get involved and human check more episodes, would be great from a data recording perspective and it can help deaf or non-native english speakers to understand the episodes. I've seen ones available transcripts can be downloaded, and there are some interesting share features.	20221115T121116

glittering_concept17	new crime junkie “merch”	5	0	does anyone else find it weird for a true crime podcast to sell merch? it seems insensitive and weird to have a piece of clothing that reads, “crime junkie” implying that one is a junkie for TRUE CRIME stories—these people are real and have real loved ones, they’re not just a story. i know crime junkie is good about emphasizing that, but the merch just feels wrong. are they at least donating some of the profits to some type of crime investigation or a company dealing with investigating crimes? i know it’s a podcast and that people who know the podcast would understand the merch, but what about people who don’t? maybe just their logo would suffice instead of the actual words “crime junkie.” thoughts?	20221115T020718

acornedbeefhash	The old episodes of crime junkie were just *chefs kiss*	184	0	I started re-listening from episode 1 and oh my gosh remembering why I fell in love with this podcast. The banter between Ashley and Brit was so real and it really felt like listening in on a conversation between two best friends. Like I realized I hadn’t heard Brit genuinely laugh in like years. She has such a cute laugh!! And she actually used to have insightful things to say. And Ashley was so funny too! I miss how ruthless she used to be, calling people the “dumbest person on the planet” and a “total idiot” LMAO I am actually giggling while re-listening. I miss the days when Ashley wasn’t afraid to be crucified for being “insensitive or disrespectful” and the poor woman could just speak. Their banter used to be SO GOOD and I really hope Brit comes back. I actually really like her voice. Crazy how much it’s changed, its hardly even the same podcast anymore. I’m considering paying for the fan club but I’m sad you don’t get all the old episodes anymore!	20221018T202859

Can I go up a tier and only pay for the new tier, or do I have to pay for the rest of my lowest tier as well, although if I would've chosen the higher tier I would only be paying for that one? Does that make sense? I just don't want to be paying extra for the lower tier privileges that I would already be getting from the higher tier if I were to get that tier. I only want to pay for the higher tier and I want to stop paying for the lower tier once I get the higher tier.

Apprehensive-Lab-285	CONSPIRACY- Boys on the Track	95	0	What did everyone think? Personally, I thought this was one of the most interesting episodes in a long time (love a good conspiracy). The case feels solved to me - I agree with the theory that the boys witnessed a drug drop and were killed because of it, especially with the witnesses who have since come forward with their story. The level of corruption seems so extreme - ESPECIALLY the medical examiner. What a joke, I couldn’t believe it when Ashley said he received a ~40% raise after (obviously incorrectly) saying a man’s head was eaten off by the dog. Would love to see the guilty parties in this case held accountable, and hopefully this episode can bring back some public pressure for this case.	20221010T191953

viv58	I know I’m late but…	91	0	Holy shit I’m so proud of Brit!! I started listening to Crime Junkie last year. I took a break from it because the scripting was grinding my gears too much. I tried out a new TC podcast but came back here due to the other podcast’s unethical behavior. Now, I knew Brit was gone due to the brain bleed. But once I caught wind about her update regarding her alcoholism and treatment, I had to go listen. I think she spoke her truth in a beautiful and sincere manner. I’m finally sober after many, many relapses. I carried so much guilt and shame around the sheer fact that my alcohol abuse had such a death grip on me. Hearing Brit share her story on the podcast was inspiring to me and I’m happy to see another successful woman enter recovery. Wishing her the best.	20221005T234732

indiamxe	Which episode is this! Help! Man murders parents as a child and then later murders his gf/wife	27	0	I remember listening to an episode of the Crime Junkie podcast. It was about the case of a man who murdered his wife/gf at the time and I’m pretty sure he murdered some other members of her family who were in the house at the time. It was later revealed he had murdered his parents as a child but because he was a child, there wasn’t publicly records about it. I think the sister was estranged from him because she was so traumatised by it. Can anyone help? I haven’t made this case up have I?	20221004T203016
s0methinginventive	Shorter Eps	15	0	Crime Junkie have always tried to shed light on cases that aren’t that well known and I feel like they have been doing that a lot more recently. With doing things like that, the eps are going to be shorter because there isn’t as much information out there about these cases as there is about more well known ones. At least they are getting these victims stories out there, they are reaching a lot of people and someone might know something that helps bring someone home or bring families closure which in my opinion, is the most important thing.	20221004T142832

Just-Tomatillo-5945	Why Ashley has so many different podcasts, even tho they all basically the same?	119	0	"Hi All- Not trying to be mean, but just curious. I love Crime Junkies, and happy that Ashley has a lot of podcasts. However I am confused why they all so same. Please fix me if I am wrong. I listened to The Deck and International Infamy and was confused why she needs to create whole new podcasts for them? I think they would fit into Crime Junkie podcast. The Deck also tells about true crime, and she usually say that cards told her what story to tell? (Please feel free to correct me, I am just confused how cards are related to that podcast). International Infamy is also true crime but which happened in different countries. But is not Ashley also tells foreigns stories in Crime Junkies? The only difference she does not have Brit on other podcasts. It is different situations with one of her ""Children"" podcasts counter clock, because there is whole season about one story. Again dont have any hate, and think more true crime podcast is better but just confused on why create different podcasts? &#x200B; Thank you"	20221002T205046

fishforeal	I think the podcast sounds better without Brit	72	0	Please hear me out before you get angry. I am a new listener and have been listening to the newer episodes first, but now I am back to the older episodes with Brit. I have become so used to Ashley Flowers' way of presenting the stories in an almost news anchor way, and then suddenly I hear Brit from out of nowhere and it startled me, haha. Her mic sounds to be less quality, and it feels like she's just reacting to what Ashley is saying, but not adding anything to it. Although, I am not finished with the episode yet, so maybe she will prove me wrong. But right now, it is Ashley presenting the information as if she's talking to an audience and Brit sounding like she's trying to have a conversation/reacting to it. And when Ashley responds to Brit, she does it in the same fashion, so if you just cut Brit out, no vital information would be absent. Am I the only one who feels this way?	20220930T201605

TrickSh0tgirl	All Good People Here oops	61	0	So I’m about halfway through All Good People Here and something has really been bugging me. I don’t know where to say this, but I feel the itch to tell someone. In one of the early chapters, Krissy’s character has a flashback to 1987. In the flashback, one of the fellow teens she is hanging out with mentions that the community (or maybe it was just some teachers, I don’t really remember) thought he was a devil worshipper for wearing a Nirvana t-shirt. In 1987. Nirvana’s first album, Bleach, didn’t come out until 1989. Even still, they weren’t popular in the “mainstream” until Smells Like Teen Spirit exploded in 1991, with the release of their album Nevermind. It seems odd to me that this slipped in there. Ashley Flowers was born in 1989, according to Google. I know that would make her quite young when Nirvana really hit it big, but still. Not seeing Nirvana as basically synonymous with grunge music, and therefor the 90s in general, felt really out of touch! Maybe it’s just me. If that’s the case then… oh well. Whatever. Nevermind.	20220929T015914

I truly wish her the best!! P.s. I have a dog, I've worked at a pet store for a decade, LOVE dogs and yet I *hate* Pruppet of the month; the squealing and fake crying actually enrages me.

IAmOatmilk	Help finding an episode!	10	0	Hey everyone! There is one episode that I remember where the victims sister kept getting frequent phone calls from the killer from an unknown number and all she could hear was heavy breathing and or the person on the other end would say “I’m gonna kill you” Sorry that’s all I remember 😅 I listened to it before bed awhile ago (maybe 2+ years ago) and it creeped me out I ended up terrified of going to bed lol Now I have a road trip coming up and wanted to add this episode to listen to. Thanks! **Editing to add a little more detail: In the episode they played a snippet of the conversation. I believe it was a voicemail and the killer would just repeat (almost like a harsh whisper) “I’m going to kill you” Appreciate the help so far!	20220927T082319

kenn_thebarbie	Missing Jonbenet Ramsey Episode?	10	0	Hey y’all, I’ve seen some other threads asking why crime Junkie hasn’t covered the JBR case, but I’m here because I KNOW I’ve heard them cover it, and now it’s completely gone from the internet. It was one of the first things I heard when I started listening to true crime podcasts, and it’s by far the best coverage I’ve heard of the case. It even threw in a suspect at the very end who is rarely talked about but who I’m CONVINCED did it, but it’s been so long since I heard it that I have no idea what his name is now. For context, I started with ATWWD and crime Junkie in about 2019 I think. But all the shows I’ve ever listened to are those two, Rotten Mango, Sinisterhood, Morbid, My Favorite Murder, Let’s Go to Court, Counter Clock, Death Bed Confessions & Wine and Crime. I’ve listened to the JBR episodes from all of these who have covered it, by the way, and feel like the one I’m thinking of isn’t any of these. The episode(s) were definitely more factual, less banter/joking and EXTREMELY thorough. Also I’m not, nor have I ever been, a patreon member for any of these shows, including Crime Junkie. Has anyone else had this experience, or know who I could be thinking of?? Cause for years since I heard it I’ve referenced what I’m thinking of as being a CJ episode and now I feel like I’m going crazy. 🥺😭	20220921T201612

Ted Bundy	14	0	"**Never done this before, but I contacted The Deck and Bryon Kastilahn (Cold Case Detective) but I think I have a good case for Ted Bundy being a possible suspect.** **Case for Ted Bundy:** * Sept 1974 - TB was living in Salt Lake City * October 1974 - Midvale Utah / Lehi Utah crimes * Nov 1974 - Murray Utah attempt * Jan 1975 - Snowmass Village / Aspen area (TB confirmed murder) * March 1975 - Vail CO (TB confirmed murder) * April 1975 - Grand Junction CO (TB confessed killing) /FBI places Ted Bundy there through April 1975 * June 24, 1975 - Majorie Fithian was murdered. * June 28 1975 - BYU murder * August 1975 - Granger Utah briefly apprehended (look into route from Roggen CO to BYU/Granger UT) **TB Victim Profile: Young Women with long dark colored hair** &#x200B; **Known TB Victim locations have TB traveling to other states to commit crimes - often during 74 and 75. 1975 three known Colorado victims all abducted from public spaces and dumped several miles (Vail was 80 miles away) from the city/town abducted.** &#x200B; **Confirmed victims from Grand Junction, CO and Vail Co - all along an 8hr route that would take him to Denver. From Denver he has 2 choices - one that puts him close to Idaho (Location of another confirmed crime) and one that puts him close to Provo Ut for June 28 1975 murder.** &#x200B; **All within 8 hours. Of known victims we know he was in Colorado in Grand Junction, CO for a confirmed murder ""through April 1975"" by FBI.** &#x200B; **We know Ted Bundy used a gun, as he knocked a victim out with one.** &#x200B; **Majorie was purported to be dropped off at a bus station, maybe Bundy was traveling through the area, stopped at a public place where people would like to have free rides and looked for girls who fit his description.** &#x200B; **As for the glass on the side of the road - say he went to knock her out and accidentally shot her when he struck her to knock her out, it goes through a window on his car so he stops immediately pulls her out then shoots her a second time to make sure she couldn't tell anyone - thinking she's dead and speeds away from the area as he typically is more calculated with his actions.** **Eyewitness purports a 2 door tan car is traveling down the road at a high rate of speed. Ted Bundy is known to be using a tan 2 door car (VW beetle[Podcast link](https://thedeckpodcast.com/marjorie-sue-fithian/)).** **More of a stretch here but VW Beatle did have convertible options and maybe with it being tan, he thought it had a brown top but could be dirt or anything else.** **The Grand Junction murder just recently was accredited to Bundy and in fact the last woman he gave up was in Colorado trying to postpone his execution.** &#x200B; **So we have known victims of Ted Bundy - March and April 1975 - 2 / 3 hours from Denver.** **We know there are unknown victims of Ted Bundy - we know he knows how to travel quickly - he escaped jail and made it to the other side of the country.** **Utah proved difficult for Ted Bundy as he got captured and had close calls - so seemingly he starts going to surrounding states for murders - as he has murders in Utah, Colorado and Idaho.** **Look at the routes - this has to be more circumstantial than Otis Tool** https://thedeckpodcast.com/marjorie-sue-fithian/"	20220921T170623

anonymous	Crime Junkie not talking about important details	13	0	"First of all, I am not a native english speaker but I hope I can get my point across. &#x200B; Before, I only listened to Casefile and Serial Killers (by Parcast) but after finishing almost every of their episodes, I needed a ""new"" true crime podcast so I started to listen to Crime Junkies. So far, I enjoy Crime Junkies but I find it a bit frustrating that they often do not talk about important/ obvious details. In my opinion of course. Here are some examples (these cases are not the only ones I felt this way): **Joyce Chiang**: Joyce vanished after a night out with her colleagues. Ashley says that the police later found some of her belongings near ""Anacostia Naval Station"" and also, a male body in the water nearby. There is probably no connection between the body and Joyce's disappearance and I don't expect CJ to give us in-depth information about his death but they should at least make clear that the body is not related to the case or just not bring it up at all. **Holly Bartlett:** Holly was a blind woman. The night before her death, she got out of a taxi near her Condo, became disoriented and eventually fell down a bridge. This is the official version anyway. The episode was all about detailing how unlikely it is that she walked almost one mile in the wrong direction (away from her Condo) and eventually fall off the bridge. Let me give CJ some credit first. It was a great episode and the drawings helped a lot to better understand this case . However, I still found it odd that they did not talk about how weird it is that she would even thinking about to crawl through a hole in a barbed- wire fence. It is a small detail but worth- mentioning. **Kyle Antonacci:** Officially, he committed suicide but CJ suggest that he was murdered due to his involvement as a witness in a (false?) rape allegation. This was a good episode but Crime Junkie did not come up with any explanation why the alleged rape victim's friends would threatened him to testify in a certain way and then kill Kyle after he agreed to record phone calls with the victim. &#x200B; Do you share my frustration or do you disagree with me?"	20220920T195645

No-System3522	help finding an episode!	2	0	So I’m new to the crime junkie fandom, I love it here, a while back I went on a crazy listening binge, and really enjoyed an episode and wanted to share it, unfortunately on my crash course, I cannot for the life of me find it. Maybe someone can help me, much appreciated in advance! Basic over view, (I also apologize in advance) the wife started having an affair with someone from her work place. She became jealous because he wanted to end things with her and be with another woman who also worked with them. The wife then takes the story to her husband but changes some names around mainly her name, so that her husband didn’t know it was her having the affair. The wife then slips out of work to murder the other woman the man was now with. And another key part I remember is that her husband and her never work together but on the day they found the co worker deceased, the husband for some reason had to go to her job and I believe that’s how it all became known.	20220913T184013

TessaNuna	Crime Junkie hate posts	234	0	Why are the Crime Junkie listeners so negative towards the podcast? Every day I see new posts nitpicking something so tiny and unnecessary. Ofcourse we can laugh at the silly phrases Brit says or how Ashley did something annoying. But dang, if you don’t like it, leave it. Be more positive people! I get so happy when I see posts about how people are missing Brit’s little interjections, or about how interesting an episode was. Nowadays it’s hard to find a post about an episode without people sh*tting all over Ashley and Brit in it.	20220909T115638

They had just moved into a new house and i think she had kids that were around 20 but i remember her being seen last in her driveway and something about a garage with some evidence and there had been workers in there.

brikakkis	Britt	417	0	So full confession, I’ve been on the Britt shade train for a while now. I never really quite pinpointed why I didn’t like her on the show but I realized it today. It’s Ashley’s fault. The scripts she writes for Brit are insulting, IMO. I listened to Brit’s update today and she was like a COMPLETELY different person. I realized it was because she was speaking freely without a script. I really enjoyed listening to her talk about her struggles and how she’s doing so well in recovery. I’m genuinely happy she beat the odds for her circumstance and give her a whole hell of a lot of credit for taking the steps she needed to take for her health. Anyways there’s no real point to this post. I was just wondering if anyone else felt completely different about Brit after hearing her have a real conversation with her own thoughts and feelings. When Brit comes back, they NEED to stop with the scripts. She is worth so much more than a few lines for the sake of exposition. I know her lines weren’t always scripted and she’s been great in many of the older episodes. Just wish they’d go back to her being the conversational listener with natural questions and feedback. All that said, again, I’m so happy she is doing so well and seems stronger than ever. I’m off the the train and praising her for doing what she needs to do for herself and her family 🙌🏻 Edit: *Brit* sorry.	20220907T212914

crimejunkiefan	Davina Buff Jones	51	0	I agree with Ashley that she needed Delia for the episode on Davina Buff Jones. I really enjoy the non-scripted interactions between the two, and the insights that Delia gives based on her experience. I really hope the publicity on Davina's case makes someone speak out about what happened to her. It was really disgusting how so many people did her dirty. I can't believe a bloody wedding is more important than justice for a murdered woman. And I'm 100% certain it was a cop that murdered her. And several cops are probably involved in that drug smuggling ring she wanted to investigate.	20220901T204440

a_contrecoeur	ELLE profile on Ashley	62	0	Thought this [ELLE profile on Ashley](https://www.elle.com/culture/books/a40803254/ashley-flowers-crime-junkie-profile-september-2022/) might interest some of you. I think the article is good (besides the title, which journalists pretty much have no control over). The article is obviously pegged to her book release, but the writer poses thoughtful questions about true crime and brings in some nuanced opinions. On a somewhat related note, I wish Delia (and any other journalists working for Audiochuck) would get more attention, since they do so much original reporting. It’s exhausting, intellectually challenging, and time-consuming work, which is why so many “content creators” don’t bother with it. I've been so impressed with Delia's reporting. She looks at every fact, statement, piece of evidence or theory from several different angles. Although I had a few issues with season four of CounterClock, they had nothing to do with her reporting. I’m excited to see what she does next.	20220831T223609

Who was she on the phone with while she got coffee? Her needing to go to the bank is concerning. Was it someone she met online? I definitely need to do more research on this case to see if there’s any more in depth information. My heart hurts for her loved ones. I hope they get answers!

osrancor	Jenny Lin Theory	57	0	"I just finished listening to both episodes, and this case is literally keeping me up at night - it's currently 1:00 am and I feel so strongly that her neighbor is the killer!! In the podcast, he's given the moniker ""Alan"" or ""A"". This case is so heartbreaking I am praying Jenny gets justice and her family gets the answers they deserve. Here's why I'm so convinced her neighbor is the killer: the **FBI profile** **describes him to a T, the duct tape, and he had the** **motive, the preparation, and the opportunity.** **Motive** This man knew Jenny. He was her neighbor. She went to school with his daughter. He sometimes gave her rides to school, saw her regularly, knew her family. Jenny was beautiful, talented, kind. He was attracted to her, and perhaps was obsessed with her. He was a reserve deputy and was reported for being a police impersonator after the murder - clearly he has some sort of complex. He was a monster hiding in plain sight. Jenny wasn't sexually assaulted, a small comfort, but as she was found with no clothes on / her clothes cut open her murder indicates a sexual motive. Maybe he was spooked and couldn't go through with it for some reason or another, maybe the gravity of what he had done had set in and he wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible, we can only theorize on what happened in that bathroom. **Preparation** He lived in the neighborhood, knew their routine, and knew their house layout. He knew her parents would be at work, and knew when she would be home from school. Seeing as he lives in basically the exact same home, he used this to his advantage as he broke in, hid and carried out the crime upstairs and in the primary bathroom. He was a reserve deputy. He reminds me of the Golden State Killer in that he had the LE experience and knowledge on how to commit a crime and not get caught. He knew not to create a struggle or leave evidence, and knew how to exit the house and get away without attracting attention. The thing about this case is the killer must have known the Lin's routine. Jenny was on the phone with her friends until 5:30 pm, and Jenny's father came home around 6:45 pm. I agree with the detectives that the killer was hiding upstairs while Jenny played piano, watched tv, talked to her friends and microwaved her dinner. He entered through the window before she came home from school, when he knew the house would be empty, and covered his break in so Jenny wouldn't notice or be alarmed when she came home. The Lin's dog was likely familiar with Alan, and therefore was not alarmed at his presence. The thought that he was listening to her as she felt safe in her home sickens me. A neighbor driving home reported seeing a man cutting through the baseball field behind the Lin's house around 6:00 or 6:30 pm, carrying a blue duffel bag, with a hood or hat concealing his face and seemed to purposely be avoiding eye contact with the driver. Police dogs tracked a man's scent through the baseball field in the investigation, this man that was spotted HAS to be the killer! The timeline fits, and the murder weapon, tools used to break in, ect were likely in the duffel bag. **Opportunity** Who knows why Alan chose to kill Jenny on May 27, 1996. It was Memorial Day weekend, and Jenny's middle school graduation was only weeks away. Maybe there was a stressor or some event in his life that drove him to commit this horrific crime, we'll most likely never know. **The Duct Tape Analysis** The exact same brand of duct tape used in the crime was found in his car a year after the murder when he was reported as being a police impersonator, and the FBI analysis showed that although it was not the exact same roll used in the crime, the way the tape was torn was similar to the tape tears used in the crime. **FBI Profile Recap:** \- Familiar with neighborhood, either lived there or visited \- May not stand out in your mind, whose presence in the neighborhood would raise no questions \- Would not appear strange, threatening or weird \- A loner who may live with others, and interact with others but prefers his own company. Has reasonably good interpersonal skills, comfortable in neighborhood and would not necessarily stand out for any reason \- Would've expressed concern or worry for Jennifer after the murder \- May have a problem with alcohol, but would not appear drunk or out of control to others \-Might've left town for a seemingly legitimate reason for a day or a few days after the murder, but if he he had ties to the neighborhood he would've returned &#x200B; I mean, I don't know this man, but I feel like this profile describes Alan fairly well. This crime was not random. The other suspects in the case, such as Shaw and the man who confronted John at the train station don't really fit this profile and I think they're red herrings. Alan is probably a seemingly normal family man, and therefore flew under the radar in comparison to the other suspects. I wonder if he happened to leave town for a day or two, (like a memorial day trip) after the murder as the profile predicted. I wonder if he's being protected in some capacity because of his ties to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. I'm convinced it's him but I would love to hear other theories and discuss this case. Jenny seems as though she was too pure for this world, a true angel. I feel so terribly for her loved ones and so badly hope this case can be solved."	20220829T085703

LakeJealous643	Alternative podcast for this weeks episode	7	0	TL;DR: if you don’t want to listen to Delia say “like” ad nauseam, but are interested in the case—Generation Why has an episode on it (episode 228) ** I’m surprised to see Delia back on for another episode considering the overwhelming negative feedback the last time she was on. I’m guessing the episode was recorded prior to the feedback about her, or maybe that feedback didn’t get back to CJ with all the censoring they do on other platforms, or maybe they just don’t care—idk. I do think the feedback about Delia last time was mostly constructive and valid. Her tone, interjections, cross-talk, excessive “likes”, and other quirks are distracting. If you can power through it, power to ya; This post isn’t for you then. For those that can’t or don’t want to—I thought I’d recommend Generation Why, as they have covered this case as well (ep. 228). Not sure if it has been recommended already. I haven’t listened to the CJ episode—however, I would bet Gen Why does a better job covering it. I used to think CJ was well researched, until I heard other podcasts—most notably Gen Why—cover the same cases and have been blown away by how many important details CJ left out. So, if you’re interested in the case and don’t want to hear Delia’s nonsense—give ‘em a try! Can 100% guarantee they will not use “like” as though it is a form of punctuation.	20220823T022458
Backyardmagician69	Episode Quality Going Down	30	0	I’m going to preface this by saying that I am still a big AudioChuck fan, especially CounterClock. I also still enjoy CJ and the Deck. I have been listening since 2019. TLDR: lots of unnecessary and detrimental commentary, poor audio quality, bashing, and a decline in the quality of research/presentation of facts. Recently I’m having trouble with the episodes coming out on CJ. Not the other shows, just CJ. They seem rushed, and the audio quality of both Ashley and Delia is poorer than it should be for a podcast and production company of this size. There are also so so so so many ads back to back. Including the book ad. And plugging of other shows. While they have always had commentary on poor or downright criminal police conduct/case handling/other investigation aspects… it really really has started to seem like it is going overboard. Less facts and more of Ashley acting like they could have done it so much better and solved it right away, while ignoring critical facts that may explain why certain actions were taken or why investigators arrived at a certain theory. Don’t get me wrong, a lot of these cases are unsolved BECAUSE of the handling. But hindsight is 20/20, and Ashley seems to really believe she is a real investigator. At the end of the day, she and her crew are podcasters, and outright bashing the people that dealt with the cases (even the ones who are doing everything they can to fix their predecessor’s horrible mishandling) will not help them get solved nor get them access to documents. Another point I’d say it’s declining on is they are missing so many important facts in a lot of the cases that could possible change the whole tone and public perception. They also have started putting a lot of conjecture and presenting cases and theories from what they think happened. Which is so disappointing because in their older episodes they steered away from this, which makes it more informative and helpful for getting awareness. For example, the most recent episode on “Davina Buff Jones”. There was so much unnecessary commentary, and what felt like tangents about “oh well this probably is what happened”, or “well the people that live there are just rich and wanted to get off tickets easy”. They also missed critical facts about Bald Head Island that really influence perspective on both the police, and the setting. Like that there are no vehicles there besides special permit ones, or that the only way there is by ferry or personal watercraft, or that it is flooded with tourists all year and isn’t just the wealthy beach house owners. These are really just the main things I have noticed over the last few months of episodes. I don’t know why it has started to decline like this, but I have a feeling it is because of how big AudioChuck is becoming. Not only does CJ have a huge audience, and many are dedicated fans, but there are numerous shows produced/voices by Ashley. Is she getting stretched too thin and trying to do too much? Or are they just more confident that they can say or do their episodes however they want and people will still listen? Has anyone else noticed this?	20220823T004013

DetectiveUndetected	Davina Buff Jones	22	0	"First time posting, long time listener...I have some issues with this episode. It's heartbreaking what happened to Officer Jones but it really does seem like suicide. Ashley played the audio from Jones at the beginning but never really used to it make a case for murder or suicide, yet I think it offers some of the best clues to what happened that night. If there were really three men with one having a gun then how did she end up shot by her own weapon? Wouldn't they have used their gun to kill her? My simple theory, Davina Jones seemed to be suffering some mental health problems. I think the insurance probably played a part in her trying to establish that three men had a gun. She might have hoped to give her family something back through the course of her death. It wouldn't be the first time an officer took their life in this fashion. The blood was transferred by her partner, who even said he was taking up a defensive position. His behavior is easily explained as an officer who probably didn't have a whole lot of experience with active shooter situation and was ""Hollywood-ing"". The police did a sloppy job but I don't think any of it was malicious. The paramedics were working with what they had. A place that can only be accessed by a ferry tells you that sometimes things are going to be done differently than a big town. I really don't like making these theories without more but it also was driving me crazy that they didn't try to approach from both sides. And honestly that should be how it is done when you don't have anything to work with. Even placing a hint of doubt or suspicion on anyone for this tragedy is really shameful, dangerous, and malicious. Without more than what was presented, it seems dubious to draw a conclusion. Many families often have a hard time accepting the suicide of someone. It usually involves lots of introspection and wondering if it was your fault or if you could have done anything. Sometimes it just easier to blame it as something else, murder, than coming to terms with the event. Sorry for the rant. Don't know if anyone else felt the same way."	20220822T202359

I love that Delia is able to speak about processes and is an actual journalist and can add on context to Ashley’s story telling. Also, it doesn’t seem scripted like with Britt. With Britt it’s just “oh no” or “full body chills” but doesn’t really add on anything usefully to the episode. What do you guys think?	20220822T054805

A girl was kidnapped and murdered. Murder went unsolved for years until police matched DNA from a used paper towel found belonging to the killer with the killers nephew who was arrested on what I believe was a traffic violation. They then found the killer via his nephew.	20220821T173813

So I started listening to Anatomy of Murder (I like it but at the same time I don’t lol) and at the beginning of every episode, there’s the “Hi I’m Ashley Flowers and let me tell you about my book” okay I honestly don’t care about this book and it drives me bonkers having to hear about it EVERY FREAKING TIME I listen to an episode but I realized it’s because Anatomy of Murder is also an AudioChuck productions podcast.

anonymous	The Deck Podcast: Shannon Michelle Aumock	5	0	Hi everyone, I just finished listening to the Shannon Michelle Aumock episode of The Deck with Ashley Flowers. I was wondering if anyone has a little more insight or thoughts on her life. I was really sad to hear that she was adopted by a family who would go on to ‘return’ her to CPS when she was 12 due to ‘behavioural issues’. I feel like this was really glossed over in the podcast… How can a family adopt a toddler and watch her grow for 9 years before ‘giving her back’ and moving away? Is the process really that simple? Is there help or steps given to the family to try prevent this? I am also confused by ‘behaviour issues’ as the rest of the podcast and the policeman on the show go on to describe Shannon as an extremely bright and sweet girl who created a student council in her group home and was devoutly religious. This doesn’t describe a teen with issues so severe her parents relinquish her to the state? I also picked up on the fact that her adoptive family didn’t attend her re-burial after she was identified. I am not American so I would love some perspective on this and whether you think a lot of info has been left out? Or if anyone has more info? Maybe I am naive but I can’t wrap my head around what happened to this child.	20220816T193800
silvergirl99	Ashley’s First Book	38	0	Did anyone listen to Ashley’s narration of the first chapter of All Good People Here? I’ve been wondering for awhile if she wrote it herself, hired a ghost writer, or had heavy editor help. Now, it’s well known that Ashley frequently mis- pronounces words. But to mispronounce a word she has, theoretically, written? Seems, as she and Brit say, “sus”. The word: misshapen. It should be pronounced mis SHAPEN, not mis HAPPEN. Now, I’ll probably read the book at some point bc I’m a crime junkie and I like to read. But, just wondering: Did anyone else catch that?	20220816T184202

stainglassaura	the Jodi LeCornu case	14	0	I am baffled by how the department handled her case. They didn't release a description of the vehicle. They didn't even make a sketch of the suspect. They didn't release the description of the suspect right away. And while this doesn't effect the case itself they left the finger printing kit in the car when they returned it to her parents. Thats just embarrassing. Not to mention it took police 15 years for the department to tell the family about narrowing down their suspects based on the physical description. This was SLOPPY.	20220808T232434

You just don't see your family for this amount of time? Can't take a vacation? Don't get paid from work? What are you supposed to do about money getting paid peanuts from the court for the day (I think my county pays $15 a day)? What if your family can't pay the bills? Can you go to routine doctor's appts? This seems quite literally inhumane and I don't understand how it's legal.	20220725T191221

Different_Quit731	Is it just me or I wish they did a more variety of cases?	18	0	A lot of their serial killer or cases with child abuse are usually always about a man being the preparator, which isn't bad, but I wish they covered more cases were the preparator is a woman. I feel like a lot of people think or ignore that women can't do something terrible or horrible to someone. Does anyone else think that or is it just me?	20220720T022438

anonymous	Latest episodes feel rushed?	48	0	Is it just me or has the quality of CJ diminished significantly in the past few months? I mean of course Brit's absence takes its toll both on the pod itself and probably also behind the scenes, but I feel that this entire last year the episodes were rushed, sloppy, and the feelings displayed by the hosts felt disingenous. Which is sad bc CJ was my favorite podcast. How do y'all feel about this?	20220718T215151

Seniaafernn	Likely an unpopular opinion	0	0	Don’t come for me. I know I’m late but I have to see if I’m the only one. I thought that the episode where Ashley tells us the news about Ashley was a bit… disingenuous. Now I know Ashley loves Brit and we could hear her heart was broken, but she still used her “podcast” voice which we have all heard change through the years. It sounded just as scripted as the show does. If it’s a scripted podcast, fine! But you can turn that off for a minute for news like that. Get out of podcast mode and be human. For us, for Ash.	20220717T140455

mrsscorsese	Really Missed Brit This Last Ep...	61	0	I think Ashley is a great storyteller, but some times she just reads so fast. It feels like she's just trying to read the paper and get it over with. I find myself just totally zoning out and not being interested in the story at all. Brit does a great job of breaking that up, even with her scripted responses. It can feel like hand holding when you're really sitting there, intently listening. But when you're losing interest, she reminds you of things that you might have forgotten or not picked up on. And overall, it helps the story flow better. Because I couldn't even tell you what that story was about. Something about the way it was told just didn't work. Just my opinion.	20220716T175738

PerkisizingWeiner	Not specific to Crime Junkie, but something about interviewed family members that bothers me	61	0	I really appreciate the effort that Ash and Britt have made to cover “fringe” cases, ones involving sex workers, homeless people, or those affected by drug addiction, and their efforts to destigmatize those things. But I feel that the message gets completely undermined when someone whose family member is suspected of using drugs or alcohol says their loved one “isn’t that kind of person” or “wouldn’t do that kind of thing,” even if their tox screen or record says otherwise. It just screams, “of course people who use drugs don’t deserve media attention, but MY loved one didn’t so their case should be covered.” I’m thinking specifically of Pravin Varughese, a college student whose mom insisted he would never drink, and Danielle Akers, who was close friends with multiple drug dealers and had a variety of drugs found in her system, but whose sister basically insisted she was friends with those people but didn’t use herself? None of these things should prevent their cases being publicized; people who are involved with drugs, alcohol, sex work, etc still deserve safety and justice. But I wish they should stop quoting people saying their loved ones “weren’t that kind of person” or “would never do that,” because 1) it contributes to classism and stigma and 2) you never really know what anyone is up to in their personal life. Not exclusive to Crime Junkie, just something that’s been bothering me.	20220624T181700

ReaperofMen42069	Differences between old and new episodes	26	0	I started listening to some of the older episodes—like Robert Fisher—and noticed that Brit and Ash would spitball theories, including personal theories, much more often. The format now is more sterile and straightforward. Nothing wrong with it. That straightforwardness is why I prefer CJ over Morbid. Was there a noticeable shift? I just assume they got busy with other podcasts after CJ blew up and had less time for casual back-and-forth conversation about the topic.	20220612T044841

paulnewman_aridehome	Since Ashley has had a baby, it seems that she’s talking more about how the mother/families feel about crimes.	51	0	This is not a criticism in any way. But just something I’ve been thinking about. I’ve noticed that in the last weeks/months, there’s been a lot of “think about how the family feels” and “let’s hear the mother’s perspective”. I wonder if this is coming from the fact that Ashley has been pregnant/had a baby in the last few months. I know a lot of episodes were recorded before the baby was born, but I would imagine that even being pregnant (which I’ve never been…) would spark these thoughts and feelings for her.	20220610T154120

mapledragonmama	Esther Hollis Episode	18	0	So I’m a little behind but kind of like it that way. I’ll binge, take a break and binge again. So on and so forth. I just listened to the Esther Hollis episode from April/2021 and all I can say is WTF. I was so stoked on the storyline, like the plot for revenge was SO GOOD and then they just drop the bomb like that?! Obviously I’m not a diehard T Swift fan or anything cause I was totally sucked in. And I should’ve known there was something up because I totally chose that episode to listen to based off it only being 25ish minutes and not having a ton of time. They got me, they got me good y’all.	20220607T184018

Dangerous_Prize_8480	Cars in CJ episodes	19	0	So I noticed that when someone goes missing, one of the first things everyone does, is go look for their car. When is gone, there is a fair chance that the missing person took it to wherever, I get that. But when the car is right there, the assumption seems to be, that the person can't have gone very far. Why is that? When my car is at my home place and I'm gone, I could be on vacation (by train or by plane and I wouldn't take my car to the airport either), I could be at work (with my bicycle), I could be on an extended tour with my bicycle... There are so many options for someone to be gone for longer without their car. So why jump to the conclusion that they must be anywhere near? Is it really like that in the US? I'm German and can't compare it.	20220602T223227

bayareastoolie	Ashley has become more bias each episode.	96	0	Been a long time listener and CJ used to do a pretty good job at just telling the story. They’ve become more and more bias though with each passing episode. This has reached a pinnacle with this recent episode (Pravin case) Pretty obvious she was HEAVILY slanted towards Pravin. Said the defendant used racial slurs on social media when it’s been shown he was quoting popular rap songs. Said he had no alcohol in his system when everyone said he was drinking HEAVILY and first lab report showed heavy alcohol that night. I’ve watched and read up on this case for years and always approach with an open mind…the judge got this right. This kid didn’t beat him to death….Pravin was blacked out and acted erratically and was punched once. Very sad case but please Ashley just tell the story…don’t slant an entire episode to fit your narrative. Just my two cents.	20220601T222314
Winterqueen5	Funerals.	117	0	I think what Ashley said about hosting and planning funerals was spot on. I lost my father in early 2020 (in February, so we were able to have a full capacity funeral). Standing up there greeting people and shaking hands as they gave us their condolences and shared memories is grueling. You have no energy and are grieving yourself, so it did feel like putting on a show for people who were less grieving. The thought crossed my mind “who is this really for?” It’s supposed to be a final tribute to a person. To celebrate that person’s life. But you’re up there still processing that your loved one has passed while knowing that the person being celebrated isn’t there. It felt like it wasn’t as much for us or my dad as it was putting on a show. And honestly felt a bit superficial. This feels selfish to say. But I think Ashley hit this spot on. But like Ashley, I would never deny someone a funeral. I really hope this resonates with others.	20220531T222438

And the federal prosecutors threatening him with a lifetime sentence for being a getaway driver for a McDonald's robbery. What a mess.	20220523T185041

Enough-Reaction5920	The name bothers me	56	0	Different aspects of Crime Junkie bother me but I still listen. Something that I really can’t get over though is that they seem so progressive… but they’re called Crime JUNKIE? There was an episode where Ashley prefaced that she was going to respect the perpetrators pronouns since they had come out as trans since the crime happened. Something like that. I was like “oh, that’s cool of them to do, especially having such a huge platform” and then immediately it dawned on me “but wait they literally call this show Crime Junkie” The name feels insensitive I guess? I don’t think it’s intentional but it still just rubs me the wrong way. Substance use disorder is an actual epidemic in the United States. It’s really bad where I’m from and referring to someone as a “junkie” is meant to be demeaning. Idk if they’ve ever addressed it, they seem really on-top-of and aware of a lot of other social issues but not this. EDIT: People do not seem to like that I’ve posted this lol. Destigmatization is essential in order to create more recovery options for individuals that have been directly impacted by addiction. The word “junkie” perpetuates stigma. I’m not saying they should change their name I just wish they’d acknowledge it. They have a giant platform. I posted this hoping that people would at least be like “hey that’s true maybe we should be more conscientious”, my bad	20220519T015109

truecrimejunkie10	If Darlie Routier is lying, she is a genuinely scary person	31	0	I recently watched a bunch of her interviews. Not gonna lie, I empathized with what she was saying. It seemed like genuine emotion when she was talking about her kids. The thing that I couldn’t shake though was the manner of how she talked about these most horrific things. She talks about getting attacked with a knife or her throat being slit almost all the way as if it’s the weekly weather. She also just says things that are a bit strange. She talks a lot about how she reacted to being accused of murdering her sons and what she thought of it. Which is strange cause what about the guy who did it? Every so often she’ll smile at an inappropriate time (like talking about Devon and Damon being killed) or you can see what looks like personalities clicking through her face and my mind goes to the thought of omg what if she *is* lying. It’s so much worse if she’s lying because it’s this whole elaborate story. If none of it were true but she can convince people of it then we have no idea what kind of person were dealing with.	20220511T043707

HopeWolfie18	CJ has changed over the years	45	0	I have been trying to put my finger on what has changed over the years as the quality of the show has gone downhill and I’m less and less interested in listening to the new episodes each week - baring in mind a year or two ago I’d be sat waiting for them to be uploaded and I think that I’ve now missed the last 2/3 episodes (I was once a member of their Patreon and have listened to all of the old episodes) and I have realised that I used to LOVE the story telling. They seemed to capture all of the details which allowed listeners to paint a picture and almost feel like your watching what is happening - it feels like it’s now mainly focused on the aftermath of the crimes covering the trial details / court cases / legal proceedings which I find the least interesting topic. I want to hear more about the crimes - personally I want to ride the rollercoaster of emotions and follow the police investigation which is what it once was - not read a page by page run down of the trial report. The narrative has shifted and I don’t really like the change in the storytelling. In my opinion, the quality has gone downhill and I listen to a lot of true crime podcasts. As I mentioned above I was also a paying member of their fan club. I often wonder if it’s because Ashley spends so much time building ‘Audiochuck’ the brand instead of focusing on CJ literally firing out new content, separate podcasts and branching out in to other lanes impacting the quality of the Crime Junkie pod. Anyone else?? 🤐	20220503T224016

Just-Tomatillo-5945	Why everyone hates Britt?	66	0	Question, why everyone hates Britt so much? Almost each post here is how they hate Britt or her voice. She is not even a real big part of the podcast. It was a little bit annoying when they just started recording because their voices had different volume (So it always sounded like Brit yelled. Thankfully they adjusted the sound now). But I definitly dont find her annoying. She just gives short commentaries to Ashley. I am not trying to be mean but just curious what is your main questions to her. Thank you	20220416T181116

KatazaraDream	Sherese Walker Bingham...what about the cyclist?	4	0	"I just listened to both episodes of the podcast, and nowhere did any of them mention the cyclist again. To me, it always seems odd to me when someone just ""happens"" upon a body, because in general bodies are hidden, unless it was a robbery gone wrong situation. Now, the situation with the dogs came up a lot, where no one could get close enough to harm her - but you don't need to get close to shoot a gun. Maybe I'm grasping at straws. I'm not saying that her husband wasn't shady for his affair, but that doesn't mean he's a murderer. Plus, why would he tell the police that no one could get close to her because of the dogs? Wouldn't that automatically make him a suspect because obviously, her husband would be the only one who could. Just seems like something a guilty party would omit. But again, did they even investigate the cyclist?"	20220415T184303
melizlo43	voice change?	0	0	anyone else notice that ashley’s voice seems to have noticeably changed pitch in the most recent episode? kinda freaked me out. also, i follow the morbid subreddit and have noticed a lot of criticism about how scripted and boring CJ is compared to ash and alaina’s banter… and i feel like in more recent episodes it almost seems like CJ is trying slightly to change this - like suddenly dropping f-bombs and showing personality like they did in the beginning. i can appreciate this in a way because it’s part of why i really enjoy morbid, though knowing how much criticism they’re getting i wonder if they see all of the online feedback and then it feels not super authentic to me anyway. just a couple random observations.	20220415T111428
Front-Flan6809	Can we talk about the Karen Gregory episode?	24	0	I just listened to it and I’m so confused. After listening, I can believe that Lewis did it and that him and his wife took what happened that night to the grave. But I don’t understand why? I can’t understand what his motive was… he just randomly brutally murdered this girl while her boyfriend was gone then just went home to his wife? Then came back to the crime scene to tidy it up? He’s a firefighter/first responder/neighborhood watch person and he repeatedly changes his story to make less sense. Also, the only physical evidence pointing to him is the footprint? This case got a guilty verdict, but it makes no sense to me.	20220415T062228

TwoPsychological4552	Brit / Morbid podcast	48	0	I think Ashley is such a good narrator but like many have said, Brit is annoying. I feel bad saying that, as I’m sure she’s a nice lady, but I don’t like her voice and it just sounds so scripted. Has anyone tried Morbid? I tried to switch one day when I got super annoyed lol, and did not like it. Too much banter and getting off topic, I like how Ashley tells the story and focuses on it. So i guess i dislike britts scripting, but dislike morbid’s unscripted banter even more? That being said, does anyone have any true crime podcast recommendations? Not too much banter and narrate well like ashley?	20220412T182345
cheetojuulpod	No empathy	2	0	I like the way that Ashley and Britt are always super engaged in each episode but they honestly are annoying. I still listen because I love true crime and other podcasters don’t tell a case as well. Also Britts voice is annoying AF. Also I feel they don’t really seem super empathetic about the victims and their families, they almost sound excited. I do appreciate all the donations they give for DNA testing and for crime stoppers but they just act kind of fun about it all like it’s not super serious.	20220412T172834

kcclem	New Crime Junkie: Listening to the Todd Kohlhepp Episode	13	0	To preface, I had never previously heard of this case besides hearing that a woman was found in a storage container somewhere in South Carolina. I was not aware of the victim or perpetrators names either. However the first clue in the episode was that it started in Chesney, South Carolina. Interesting, I was familiar with the area. Then, they mention Woodruff. Now Woodruff is a small town in the Greenville Spartanburg area that I was strangely familiar with because I had regularly passed through Woodruff while I was living in Greenville, SC. But as I continued to listen to the episode.... I got full body chills y'all. I realized that I had regularly passed by this 100 acre fenced property in Woodruff, SC exactly as the episode described. What's even more unnerving? I lived in Greenville from 2013-2017, the exact times when Todd was active and keeping women at his properties. I probably passed right by the property while the victims were very much alive.	20220408T125706

daddypoodle	Crime Junkie - unsubscribed finally	196	0	Ah, lovely “crime junkies.” This podcast got me into podcasts, and has been my favorite thing about Monday’s for years now. I’ve been subscribed to the Patreon on and off, even up to the $20 level (big spender here.) I was so excited the day I found this place! I was thinking it would be a magical land, where we would all discuss cases and have a grand ole time. Instead, I found myself spiraling down a rabbit hole. So many things were wrong with CJ, and I had never thought of any of them before. I was sad, but I turned a little blind eye to it. When the first accusations of plagiarism happened, I also turned a blind eye (I know…) As I’ve kept up with this thread, noticed the changes in the episodes, AND now that I know The Deck was completely stolen, I’ve decided to call it quits. I unsubscribed to every show and unfollowed on all platforms. I’ll be leaving here, too. It felt so weirdly freeing? I just don’t feel great about giving my time and any money to these people anymore. This weird “empire” in the podcast world that is blatantly stealing from others and losing quality quickly. Anyways, TLDR: I broke up with audiochuck. Why did I write this entire, dramatic speech? I have no idea. Xoxo	20220405T123228

Every time I try I just cringe and it just feels weird and different I found so many other great podcasts, and then everything happened with that missing person card game show and I just grow further and further away from this podcast I used to love. I’m fully aware this sounds so dramatic but Mondays just aren’t the same anymore but I can’t bring myself to listen. Is anyone else in the same boat?	20220322T184744

I understand they have done hundreds of episodes and can’t all be winners but the most recent episode felt like it was really clutching at straws and (not to be offensive to the victim) a relatively uninteresting case that seemed to have been milked because they had access to the family/sheriffs department. Maybe I’m being hypercritical but they definitely don’t feel like the earlier episodes that got me into true crime podcasts.	20220322T135010

Anyone else notice this?? It also sounds like Ashley and Brit’s parts this week were recorded separately. I’ve noticed it recently, they used to have a natural flow when they would record in different places but would be on the phone together. Now i feel like Ashley records her parts and then Brit records hers, and they’re spliced together after the fact.	20220322T030802
laurenec14	Has the format changed a bit?	54	0	I feel like they have more audio from the family/law enforcement in recent episodes.

Has anyone else noticed this? ETA: okay, good to know it wasn’t just me 😄 Hopefully they reduce it a bit in the upcoming episodes.	20220321T211821

realtimepersephone	Ashley is kind of rude to Brit	179	0	I understand that Ashley is the host and that Brit is there to further the story. But anytime Brit seems to go off script and mention something useful, Ashley is very quick to dismiss and doesn’t engage with Brit, sometimes even snapping in response to whatever Brit is saying. I get that Ashley wants this to be her show but it’s hard to listen to now that I’ve picked up on the rude behavior. There are a lot of complaints about Brit being on script and I think that’s because Ashley shuts her down whenever she does go off script. Brit brings up some interesting points and facts sometimes, none of which Ashley takes into account. Why bring someone on your show if you just want them to be a lapdog? Sometimes Brit sounds so nervous when she goes off script and says something, which Ashley always ignores. I enjoy her calm tone of voice when listening to some of these horrific stories.	20220321T043257

But I have to put my foot down at “happy hooha 😀” and “big vagina energy 😜👍🏻” I get it’s an ad and they probably don’t write it but now I feel like I can’t even listen around others with all these happy hoohas every five minutes. Maybe the goal is just to drive us to Patreon because I’m almost there 😭😭😭 Edit to add: I do skip the ads 95% of the time. But when I’m driving or cooking or washing dishes or working and can’t pick up my phone to skip the ads, “happy hooha” six times an hour isn’t my personal fave	20220315T173027
oliviahabaty	I’m sorry but	22	0	I cant stand Brit’s voice. It’s not her fault obviously, nothing against her, she’s fine, but I can’t stand the speaking as if there’s a comma between every two words and the overemphasis/hurried speech. “wait, but, ashley, i thought, whenweopenedtheshow, you said he…waaassnt in townduringthemurder? How was he, seenatthehouse, then?” i can deal with it when she just has those scripted interjections between her and ashley but if she goes off on a story or an ad plays that she reads i stop everything to skip, literally drop whatever i’m cleaning or doing. i’m sorry i don’t wanna sound mean, like i said it’s not her fault, but i haven’t seen anyone explicitly mention this and i had to sound off. is it just me? probably lol. it’s a large piece of the puzzle of why i’m not really interested in CJ anymore, which sucks i really wanted to like it. the deck kinda slaps though	20220315T091104

bayareastoolie	Am I the only person thats super annoyed with this?	96	0	I’d like to star by saying I’m a huge fan. I’ve pretty much been a supporter since the first 2-3 episodes. But I have to ask if anyone else gets annoyed with this. Every single episode is obviously very scripted. That’s not news. My gripe? Ashley will say something and then Britt asks like the most perfect question pertaining to the case at hand like it’s organic and not scripted. Or ashely will say something and as a viewer you’re thinking “wait but what about ______” and then Brit says “but Ashley I thought _____ wasn’t married?!.” Like it’s aLways the most perfect response or question. It’s a weirdly specific gripe but does anyone kinda cringe or get annoyed?	20220313T000809

unimpresssive	Does Anyone know where I can Listen to more Precedent?	29	0	Hey guys, After listening to the two Precedent episodes they put up when Ashley was on Maternity Leave I was kind hooked and really want to hear more ...but I can't seem to find it anywhere. I downloaded Stitcher and even paid for premium because I thought that was why I couldn't find it but I still can't find access to it. I don't know why I can't figure out where to listen, does anyone know where it is? &#x200B; EDIT: Okay so I'm a part of the CJ Patreon and have the app so I used the Direct Message feature and asked where I could find it on the off chance I would get an answer and they actually did . They told me It's not currently available anywhere but they will be releasing more episodes on CJ throughout the year so I guess that's that. ( time to cancel my stitcher premium subscription lol)	20220310T165948
postgrad-dep18	Ok. I listened to this weeks episode and kept cringing whenever Britt would talk in her new voice. I went back and listened to an episode from 2019. She and Ashley 100% changed the sound of their voices to be polar opposite.	0	0		20220310T130055

Lanette123	Darlene Routier	7	0	I saw an episode about a serial killer on TV I don't remember which one. He had broke into a womans house and stabbed and I believed her young son. The woman was under suspicion I think she may have been arrested. Her story did not make sense. Much later evidence was found DNA that it was this serial killers. This Killer went on to say that he knew for a fact that people were on death row because of him. From what I remember this killer was active during the time of the murder of Darlene routiers boys. The stories' sounded so similar. I wish I could remember the show Has anyone investigated this	20220308T195739

anonymous	CJ starting to feel too abbreviated?	79	0	I didn't want to make this post because I do genuinely like this podcast and will continue to tune in weekly to hear the stories, but lately I feel as though the cases being told to us are very abbreviated and cut for details. It's gotten to the point where if I want to hear about a case CJ has covered for the fan club (I'm not a member), I'll just google that person's name and read some news articles to get the basic picture, because I feel like that's what CJ offers anyway....some basic google search information organized and re-read to me. I guess I'm just more used to Morbid's type of research. I know the hosts there do a lot of research with newspapers, books, movies, etc. and I'm NOT saying CJ doesn't put in the work to research. I'm saying that it feels as though the episodes are too short and too surface-level for what the cases could actually be. I understand that Ashley and Brit and Audiochuck have their hands busy nowadays and I'm still grateful that they do the research at all....I guess I'm wondering if anyone else thinks the amount or depth of research has gone down in the last few months/years?	20220303T155620

Hackable_acct	They owe Faith Hedgepeth's roommate an apology.	165	0	Faith Hedgepeth was brutally murdered in her college apartment. Her roommate Karena called 911 upon discovering the body. Brit's not buying the roommate's innocence. Fast forward to 2022: police found a match to the perp's DNA and have a murder suspect in custody awaiting trial. His guilt proves the roommate's innocence. Now let's rewind back to the podcast episode where Brit and her beloved crime analysis blog shit all over Karena for not referencing the victim by name to 911. Imagine being In a scenario where you have to call 911 upon discovering your friend and roommate beaten to death. And then some Crime Junkie bitches release a podcast implicating you as a suspect because Brit (of all people!) doesn't approve of your 911 etiquette. Also, I couldn't pay my January fan club monthly fee because I had covid so Ashley and Brit revoked my access to the episode backlog. I hope Ash and Brit don't become to the true crime world what Lena Dunham is to the #MeToo movement. I hope they become good people and apologize to Karena Rosario. Edit: Update: TL;DL: Ash and Brit spent SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES criticizing an innocent girl's 911 call in an emergency.	20220225T040133

Desperate_Chip_343	The emphasis put on mental health.	16	0	I hope I am doing this properly. But does anyone want to talk the emphasis we have seen Ashley and Brit put on mental health, yet fail to fully actually do at the same time? Here is what I am trying to explain while yea they have brought it up and explain some of their struggles with it, when it comes to mental health in their podcast it is kind of thrown aside. It's passively mentioned as part of the case. Now, I understand they have time constraints, however I feel like they made me feel like it was a passion of theirs like they want people to understand how complicated mental health is. But lately it seems like it doesn't matter anymore. One of my biggest peeves is when it's mentioned in a case as they may have suffered from mental health problems but the family says no. Ok... Well a lot of people are good at hiding it or the family is just not always attentive enough to be aware or maybe are in denial. What about when it is just a break, which can happen out of no where. There is proof that people can have random psychotic episodes. I'm just ranting but also want to know if anyone feels the same way.	20220221T202907
anonymous	Mysterious Death of JoAnn Matouk Romain Discussion	50	0	Just finished listening to the JoAnn Mattock Romain episode, Parts 1 and 2 and wanted to discuss. Does anyone else think that it really was a suicide? JoAnn's paranoia leading up to her death could be due to some mental health concerns, her purse could've ripped in regular, day-to-day life, and the police going looking for JoAnn rather than Michelle even when the car was registered to Michelle can be explained easily by the fact that JoAnn's purse and ID were in the car. I didn't understand what was so 'mysterious' about her death.	20220221T174313

marcelojd	Help finding an episode!!	11	0	Help! I’m trying to find an episode for a school assignment but can’t remember the case. It was of a murder where they couldn’t find the body of the person they believed was dead. The prime suspect had an alibi from his ex-girlfriend, but once they broke up police asked her if there was anything about him that she wondered about and she says “I always wondered about that storage locker/shed.” Cops do a search and find the body of the person there. The murderer was also on probation and didn’t disclose he had a storage/shed. Ex said he would pay for it no matter how behind they were on other bills.	20220220T004522

xoLaraLee	911 call analysis	53	0	So I’ve been catching up on some crime junkies episodes from the past couple years that I missed and I’m currently on the episode on Michelle O’Connell. Just before that I listened to the episode on Faith Hedgepeth. In both episodes they mention how in the 911 calls the callers refer to the victims as “my roommate” and “my girlfriend” and neither times did they mention the victims names. Both times I can’t help but think this seems like a stretch to me? Or just odd to point out.. I’ve never had to call 911 for any reason, but I can’t imagine making a call and saying “Matt isn’t breathing” I think my instinct would be to refer to him as my boyfriend. Calling them by name doesn’t, to me, automatically make someone seem guilty or suspicious. I’m curious what other listeners think about this.	20220218T171135

rashawnvalentine	How do you go about finding an adult who was never reported missing?	24	0	My best friend of 7 years has always talked about her sister. When I first met my friend, her sister was rarely around but she was dealing with some personal things, rough relationships with boyfriends, drugs and jail time. She wasn't very active in the family, but she was loved regardless. About 5 years ago, my friend's sister (25 at the time I believe) had a blow up with her parents after she was bailed out of jail by them. She asked to live with them, they told her no, and from that day she just disappeared. My friend offered her place for her sister to stay at, but my friend believed that she was on drugs at the time because she responded very aggressively and denied the help. Being that she was an adult and this is something that another person in the family had done before (leaving after a blow up and never coming around and ignoring the family's attempts to contact him), the family never reported her missing. 5 years have gone by now and they try to reach out to the last cell phone number they have, they never get an answer though their messages sometimes go through. Her social media accounts have been inactive ever since. Her ex boyfriend used to say that he heard from her at the beginning and would tell the family that she was in another state, now he says that he doesn't hear from her at all even though they have a shared bank account. Her family on her father's side ask about her because they haven't heard from her either since this last incident and everyone finds it strange that she didn't go to them if she had nowhere else to go because she was loved by that side of the family. Her grandfather recently passed away and every was trying to reach out to her when he was passing and she didn't respond to anyone's messages. My friend really wants to find her sister, at this point it's been 5 years and she is worried that something may have happened to her. The family strongly believed that she was using drugs in the past and around the time she was last seen and they are worried that drugs are somehow involved. My friend works in the medical field and has searched for patient records matching her name, including hospital records and nothing has come up. She said she checked jail records as well and couldn't find her also. She's starting to consider looking into jane does at this point, but the real problem is no one knows where to start. She was 25 when she was last seen, she was an adult and she was never declared missing. 5 years later, they don't know what to do or how to go about finding her. What can they do at this point to try and find her? Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, I just didn't know where else to go to help my friend. I went to the missing persons subreddit, but all of the posts seem to not get much attention. If anyone knows a better subreddit for me to post this on, please let me know.	20220217T180912

woofgabs	What episode is this?	5	0	I swear to GOD that CJ covered this case and I can't remember the name of, but I'm pretty sure they moved it to patreon or removed it. It's about a woman and a man (or two) that were out together some night. Dude(s) took her back to either his parents' or the friend's parents' cabin and killed her. Parents came home eventually and the girl was gone, the guy might've been missing too. Police found blood evidence in the basement/ den, I think in the carpet, but I can't remember specifics. They might've found a piece of her jewelry or something as well. Please tell me somebody remembers this, I know I listened to it sometime around December 2020 or January 2021 but haven't been able to find it since.	20220215T233659

NetworkNo9672	Just purchased Patron, is it worth it?	14	0	So after this weeks episode, I HAD to buy the Patron to hear part 2. However, I ended up getting the backlog, where instead of 5 dollars a month, I paid the annual 60 up front. So I actually don’t know how patrons works, and my boyfriend told me this is one of the only ones, that he knows of, where the annual fee is needed to get the back log of episodes. Hearing that was kinda annoying because… I mean like ya why is this the only place that requires that payment up front for a backlog of episodes??? Granted I know everyone may not have 60 dollars up front, but to me, I feel like if I’m going to pay 5$ x 12 month = 60$ per year, I might as well pay the annual fee of the $60 for the back log of episodes. (This is at the lowest tier). Honestly so far, I like it. I feel like so many people on Reddit rip apart the podcast, but to me, I have loved all the episodes I have access to. I feel like I’ve accessed a whole new world of stories! So honestly it’s been worth it. Anyone else? I want to hear your experience.	20220215T061045

Calm_Contribution460	In need of a true-crime buff	18	0	I served as a juror in a cold case crime around 2017 and 2018. The murder took place sometime between 1970-1985. (details are fuzzy because my me memory sucks) It was a tragic case of a young guy either late 20s to mid 30s. He was on his way home from work when he picked up a young hitchhiker, I believe she was 19. She ended up shooting him, stuffing his body on the floor board of his Ford pick up truck. His truck was stick shift and since she did not know how to drive it she wrecked the motor and left the truck on the side of HWY 99 in Sacramento. He was found days later on a hot summer day badly decomposed. There was a ticket on his windshield like an officer had been by but didn't notice the man curled up on the floorboard. Fast forward to 2017/2018. A woman living in a different state was arrested because her finger prints were perfectly preserved as she rolled the window to open the driver side door through the outside since the door handle in the inside was broken. This case impacted me so much to hear the mother of his child testifying about the last time they spoke. unfortunately they had fought the night before so when he didn't come home she thought he spent the night at his mother's house. it was soo sad and I really wish I could remember the name of the victim or the murderer to look at the behind the scenes that aren't allowed in the trial. it seems so senseless she got away with less than $10 and only drove the truck about a mile or two before blowing the engine so I wish I could know more. I think his middle name was Lee but I'm not entirely sure. This case was committed and tried in Sacramento CA and the Judge mentioned it was her last case before retiring. The convicted murderer was arrested 2016 and went to trial 2017 or 2018. if any crime buffs want to try their hand to find more info that would be great.	20220212T050829

Soo WTF https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/06/crime-junkie-ashley-flowers-precedent-podcast-stitcher-premium-1234783920/amp/ Edit: i’m just saying this has nothing to do with her having a baby I think there’s other things she could’ve done like one take a time off from the podcast and not release anything new. she could’ve prerecorded a few episodes before she went on maternity leave so that she could just release them then. Or maybe have her cohost do a few episodes	20220206T135955

UGANick	What are everyone’s first thoughts on The Deck?	37	0	I listened to the first two episodes this morning. I think the concept is more interesting than I would have expected from the promos Ashley was posting to Instagram and stuff. I don’t really miss Brit’s fake “surprise” act. I also understand now why they brought that reporter onto Crime Junkie - I’m assuming they were working on this show mainly.	20220202T145028

And the way the media painted her as a ""troubled girl"" who ""played with fire"" infuriated me. This poor girl had been neglected by so many adults in her life and had to resort to sex work (at age 12!) to support her sister. She was 100% a victim and the way this case was handled is disgusting. And to not even get her name right?! Ugh. Prayers and love for her family... hope this case gets solved."	20220201T042841

GreenAd9576	Ashley Flowers Opinions	172	0	I used to love the podcast, was an avid Patron and genuinely enjoyed listening to CJ and other AudioChuck podcasts. But throughout the last year or so, Ashley has increasingly become a sell out in my opinion and will do anything, including the plagiarism/ making Britt look like a complete fool and run the true crime category into the ground to make a buck. Being a producer and as accomplished as she is a great feat and I won’t say she’s in the wrong for looking out for #1 herself but when you produce and host more podcasts than you can count on two hands and they all become temporary shows then what is the point. All her stories on social media and episodes end up being based on the fact that she works so much harder than other creators and is so exhausted running her own business but girl we all work hard and we’re all exhausted just don’t do 15 shows at a time. Don’t ruin the great thing you had going by getting too big a head	20220131T154942

jeffersonsteelflex76	Theory on Robert Wone	17	0	In the episode they say there was a syringe used but no drugs were found in the system. They did not check for paralytics - which is likely what was used. A bit more far fetched theory that was my first thought - related to the lack of bleeding - was that some sort of snake venom was injected into the bloodstream. This would coagulate the blood rather quickly and possibly (?) Stop any kinds of bleeding with the right amount. It's a far fetched theory because I would assume forensics would reveal something wrong with the blood in this case but just thought I'd share.	20220127T213250

Narwhal_Pristine	Help finding an episode	15	0	Hi! I feel like this case was one of the first episodes of Crime Junkie, but I can’t find it and I’m not sure if it was one of the episodes that were deleted. Here’s what I remember: An older teen girl with a learning disability is at camp (I think?) and makes friends with this super evil fellow teen. For reasons I can’t clearly remember, this girl decides to murder her in the woods. I believe a couple of friends and the boyfriend were there keeping watch/holding down the victim as she was brutally attacked. I know there are unfortunately plenty of cases like this one, but the brutality of this one really stuck out to me. Any help is much appreciated! Thank you!	20220123T134505

boldoldsoul	Something I thought of while listening to the “Beth Doe” episode…	4	0	Is anyone else kind of surprised, in hindsight, just how wildly inaccurate the isotope testing results were? They supposedly determined that “Beth Doe” was of Eastern European descent (Serbia, etc.), was an immigrant from an Eastern European country (IIRC Evelyn Colon was of Puerto Rican descent and spent her entire life in the continental United States, but correct me if I’m wrong), and that she spent time in the southeastern United States, when in reality she was a native of the Northeast (New York/New Jersey). I understand that all this was done back in the 1970s, but I just found it quite striking how far off the estimations were. Did anyone else also think about this, or am I just getting too hung up on the little details? Anyway, love the podcast!	20220121T215521
ssnider0615	A determined daughter has spent almost 20 years piecing together every clue she could find about the disappearance of her mother. This is Diane Theresa Francis' story, as told by her own daughter.	61	0	"Hi guys! I found the following post on Facebook and I thought to bring it here because on Facebook it went unnoticed (it has only 16 'likes'). The original poster is Sherri Lynn Snider, one of the daughters of Diane Theresa Francis, a woman who vanished in thin air almost 20 years ago. **Update: Sherri is on Reddit and she is reading our comments, so if you have further questions you can talk directly to her. This is Sherri:** u/ssnider0615 This being said, let's move forward. According to [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/diane-theresa-francis), Sherri's Mom was last seen by her daughters in Melbournce, Florida sometime in June 2003. She was arrested for trespassing in Jacksonville, Florida on November 27, 2005, and was last seen when she was released the next day. This is the last indication of her whereabouts. At the time of her disappearance, she had a ""high risk"" lifestyle and was transient throughout southeast Florida. She has never been heard from again, and her daughters hired a private investigators who was unable to locate her. A former boyfriend reported Francis missing in 2015. Few details are available in her case, but her determined daughter has spent years piecing together every clue she could find. This is Sherri Lynn's original FB post (edit: I removed the link because it breaks the sub's rules) where she tells the whole story. Maybe these details can help someone remember something and come forward with the missing pieces of this puzzle. Or maybe they can inspire the sleuths to join Sherri Lynn in her search for answers. **This is Sherri Lynn's original post, copy/pasted:** ***My Mother; Diane Theresa Francis*** *{In this document; I try my best to relive and walk you through my mother's life as I saw it and how other loved ones of hers have seen it throughout the years. They have helped me fill in the huge gaps, but there are many missing pieces that I still don't know. Remember, I was only 4 years old when the issues with Child Protective Services in Florida started and only 9 years old the last time I physically laid eyes on my mother.* *My mothers legal name is Diane Theresa Francis. She was born July 7, 1968 in SomersviIle New Jersey. From what I've gathered she was like any other ordinary child but things became difficult for her growing up when her parents separated and divorced when she was only about 12 years old.* *There is some speculation that she may or may not have experienced some physical/sexual abuse as a child, but nothing has ever been confirmed to date. Diane grew up with both of her parents up until about the age of 12 when they decided to divorce; Rosalie Lamonto is her mother and her father is David Leslie Francis Sr.* *Diane was always a Daddy's girl growing up and decided to live with her father in Florida when her parents separated. Diane also has two younger Brothers David Leslie Francis Jr, and Michael J.Francis. They chose to move to Florida with their father as well.* *My mother was believed to be a mostly well behaved child up until about the age of 12 or so when her brothers (David and Michael) told their mother that Diane had been “sneaking boys in and out of the house in the middle of the night.” Nothing has been confirmed about this accusation either.* *My mother went on to graduate from 8th grade and continued on normally for the next year. When my mother reached high school she became a drop dead gorgeous young woman, boys were constantly pursuing her. At this point she began to drift far far away from the once normal and well behaved child she once was. Her father recalls her “getting in with the wrong crowd” One of these boys she chose to hang out with even got her pregnant at 16 years old ( possibly Kenny Feckowitz).* *My mother would later give birth to this baby prematurely in the hospital bathroom. This baby was my sister “ Stephanie Francis”. She was born and died on April 11,1985. She had a proper burial and was laid to rest in Denville, NJ at the Denville Cemetery. Different encounters from Stephanie's birth time period tell numerous different stories, some say my mother was devastated and that she never came back from this, others say she showed no remorse or connection to the child whatsoever.* *In the year 1990,( just five years after the passing of my sister Stephanie). My mother would meet my biological father Charles Edward Snider, (the night of my fathers birthday 1990, at a bar in long branch NJ.) My father also says my mother was in a relationship already at that time but her boyfriend (Kenny) was away so they got together secretly. Just one year after my mother and father met my sister Jessica Marie Snider was born September 22nd,1991 in Morristown New Jersey.* *My Birthday would follow not too far behind hers. I was born in Long Branch New Jersey on June 15th, 1993. Somewhere in between the birth of my sister and my mother's pregnancy with me she would take a turn for the worse. My father claims while my mother was pregnant with me she started doing drugs and partying as well as cheating and not coming home some nights. This came as a shock to me as in the 28 years I’ve been alive I have yet to hear that I was a “drug baby” (but I’d believe pretty much anything at this point.)* *My mother and father would continue to live in New Jersey moving here to there in order to make ends meet, staying with family whenever possible. Eventually they would end up in the state of Florida in the year 1994.* *My mother said she had it with New Jersey and claimed she wanted to be near her father again. (just 1 year after I was born) My father claims they moved the family here in order to be closer to my grandfather Dave and step-Grandmother Rita Cook (per my mother's request). Little did they know this might be the move that set my mother's fate.* *Just one year after their move to the state of Florida, they end up in a trailer park where my mother would meet a man by the name of John Schmitt. She told my father “I'm going to marry John and he's going to be the girl's father now”. In a sense she was telling my father she didn't want to see him anymore.* *My dad then moved back to New Jersey to be back home with his family. We never saw him again. My mother met John Schmitt in 1995. My father Charles Snider claims my mother started seeing John while she was still dating him. The relationship between John Scmitt and my mother was a happy one at times but like every place we would soon end up, my mother let the drugs get the best of her and for the most part….us too because she had lost us again.* *When my mother met John Boggs it was 1997 just two years later and he had just served a four year sentence in prison, and he was fresh out the day that they met. My mother was actually dating one of his former friends at that time. Daniel Irwin, the man my mother was dating at the time, was also the manager of some apartments that John Boggs' family owned (Hired by John himself).* *John was returning from prison to pick back up managing the property for his family. John claims he swooped in like a hawk and stole my mother from his buddy. (Daniel Irwin) This was now the beginning of another shaky and mysterious relationship. We would soon return to my mother's care and begin a life with her and John Boggs.* *In the year 1999 My mother was still living with John Boggs. John was an abusive man and also a man who fell madly in love with my mother. I recall him throwing her across the house on one occasion which also included him punching his fists through the door to get to her, my sister and I jumping on him kicking and screaming to try and help my mother. Drugs were always present with the two of them together.* *My mother always denied the abuse to police in order to continue on as if nothing had happened and keep her place to live for us kids.There were good times as well, i don't neglect the facts here but the situation as a whole was a nightmare to say the least. My mother was tired and the police were called this same year in response to her trying to commit suicide because she had lost us girls again…... John Boggs and my mother had a history and I don't quite know everything that entails but he gave her his tattooed initials as a gift and they were always inseparable when things were good.(We’ll definitely get back to John Boggs but he goes silent on this case until the year 2015!!)* *Roger Foreman was driving down the road one day in or around the year 2000 just one year later. He was in his work van (he ran a landscape business) and he spotted my mother on the side of the road walking, he stopped her so he could speak to her. She said she had just gotten into a huge fight with her crazy boyfriend at the time (John Boggs) and she explained she did not want to go back home to him... That was the beginning of their relationship right then and there. We soon were allowed to visit with my mother once again.* *John would often show up at our house looking for my mother and in turn this would cause physical fights with Roger Sr. Roger Foreman Sr. had a son of his own and things were seeming to be looking up for the most part. We spent a lot of time with Roger Sr, his son and my mother (mostly on Arranged supervised visits) this continued until we were allowed to go home to my mom”permanently“.* *My mom was happy again and always joking, almost back to her normal “Di-Di” self in a sense. (Apparently Roger had lost his son in the past and offered his caseworkers contact information to my mother in order for my mother to work on getting my sister and I back into her care as well). I felt like it had been no time and we were back with my mom again and trying to never look back from it, but it was surely not the end….* *In late 2003 Jessica and I were removed from my mother's care for the last and final time. We lived in the IndianRiver Cottages.(they were these awful bright pink, one room, 1 bed shacks). Jessica and I spent the majority of our time while living here in the trailer park down the road with friends or in the neighborhood that surrounded our loop of run down hotel rooms. I remember smoking cigarettes with the kid next door all the time or just basically doing whatever we wanted. Going inside our house was a rare occasion.* *In 2003 our caseworker pulled up to the cottage where we lived. We were so traumatized by this point that when our case worker showed up to remove us this time…... we ran for our lives, because this time we knew. We took one look at each other swung open the back door of our shack and off into the woods we both went tripping over one another screaming as if it would help in some way. We knew what was happening.* *All in the same moment so many thoughts crossed my 10 year old mind. “Three strikes you're out mom” “this is it” “don't look back” I remember jessica telling me we should go to our friends house and i'll never forget turning around and seeing my mom being put into a police car and knowing that was the last time i may ever see her again. When we reached our destination…. Our friend's mother ended up having to call DCF in order to protect herself (understandable). We were only about 9 & 11 years old.* *Jessica and I now had to re-enter the Florida foster care system. We lived in multiple homes, some really good and some bad. I won't go into full detail as I don't remember it all but my sister and I experienced a wide variety of homes from shelters to facilities, overnight arrangements, relative care, adoptive placements, respite care. On the flip side there were Amazing homes in south Florida that I will never ever forget. Part of why I’m a somewhat structured and steady headed human being is from my Foster mom’s Joanne, Alice, Denise, Dedra, Sheila, Maryellen,Joanie, Allison and Ms. Liz. These women are forever a part of me.* *I just won’t deny the bad side of it all either. We once slept on the dcf office floor because there were no homes available at the time that would accept two pre-teen girls.( we weren't exactly top of the line product for foster parents) I remember being lost in the Florida foster care system at one point and looking back it means so much more now than it ever did to me then. I was just a number on a bed. We all were.* *The Florida foster care system failed my sister and I in a major way. Years ago they had my entire family convinced (including my father) that we were going to be happily adopted and that they should basically stay away from us. This has never been nor was this ever the case.* *At this time Jessica and I were at an all girls ranch in Cocoa Beach Florida and had not been checked on by any caseworker in weeks. We experienced several “Adoptive Placements'' but none of them ever worked out. Jessica and I went on like this until about 2008, where we found ourselves in an all girls shelter with some pretty strict rules on not contacting biological families.* *One night, I finally took a stand and stole a phone book from the office in the shelter we had just been dropped off in. I searched all night and finally found one name “Rita may Cook.” I didn't know why i recognized this name or what it meant but I knew I had to try it.* *I shakely picked up the phone trying to be as quiet as I could (what I was doing was illegal) I dialed that number twenty times and twenty times over I erased it, racking my brain for any memory of this woman and how I might have known her. Finally it hit me, “Rita may cook, Rita may not” something my mother always joked about.* *This was the woman I called grandma my whole life. I remember my hand hitting the call button without a moment to second guess my decision and the phone was ringing…..ringing…..ringing…& then...I heard her.”h-hello…..w-who is this?” a raspy startled voice answers…( it was late)…. I say hesitantly…. “Its sherri”….. “Sherri who?” she replies…. “ Sherri Lynn Snider” I say. Before she says anything else I can hear tons of rustling and then she yells “DAAAVVEEEEE” calling out to my Grandfather (David Francis) from across the house.* *After years of being seperated i had found them. This was it. This was my fight ending…..this was my worry leaving… this was everything I had ever hoped for. This was my FAMILY!…...my mommy.* *We were holding a yard sale at the shelter so I invited my grandfather and the next day he showed up. The hilarity of it all was that we found out they lived 1 street over and had lived there since I was a little girl. After 9 years of being separated we were randomly placed from 3 hrs away,…1 block from my mother’s fathers home....But again, this was not the end of my journey to find my mother.* *Later it would be discovered that my family had no idea of my mothers current whereabouts. They had not even the slightest bit of answers for us and so……we were completely shattered all over again. Before we knew it we were in relative care with my Aunt Joanne Francis in 2008-09. We both aged out of the Florida foster care system at 18 years old. This didn't happen for me until the year 2009-2010. This is when all of my “Real” searching began….* *A few Years ago I discovered some odd information but, it was too little too late. This usually happened with my mother’s situation. I found an alias, a traffic citation, numerous police reports, I obtained my mothers last mugshot, court records, arrest records, and I also ran lengthy internet paid and free searches. None of which led me to any current information regarding my mothers current or even most recent whereabouts.* *I found my mother’s best friend whom we all lived with around the time we last saw my mother but by the time I found her, she had already passed away a year prior to finding her. I found her best friends daughters also who were just little babies (4 years old) when all of this happened and had been taken away as well at the same time we were taken. Everything that has ever existed regarding my mother Diane Theresa Francis or her alias, existed during or before the year 2005 possibly 2006.* *I hate to admit the facts here but it's been almost 20 long long years of me hoping, praying, wishing my mother would just commit a crime or call/show up… Mess up…something…...anything. But she Doesn’t. I contacted each and every one of my mother’s former boyfriends and got different recollections from each one.* *One boyfriend was long gone and out of the picture by the time she disappeared. Her last known boyfriend claims to have left her at some type of boarding house right near the house we last saw her in around 2004-2005.* *Another One of her boyfriends claims he has no idea. I guess My first “ real “ & official attempt at locating my mother would have had to have been in 2009-2010. This was the year we reunited with our “entire” family and had asked them where she was.* *The answers we received were vague and scattered. “We had Cop friends of ours look for her and the trail ended in Palm Bay, Florida” & “We did everything we could for her,she didn’t want help” and my most favorite “You need to let it go.” From then on, I made it my mission and mine alone to do whatever it takes to find her.* *I contacted the Florida department of children and families’ services and also my prior caseworker (Beatrice Borsiquot) in order to obtain my foster care case file. They still will not release the entire thing to me stating that I would have to go there in person to obtain it in its entirety and I’ve been told it will be destroyed soon as well.* ***I made numerous calls to the Melbourne, Palm Bay and Jacksonville Florida police departments and sheriff's offices as well as jails (with efforts in mind of filing a missing persons report). I was laughed at…. multiple times. I was told that my mother is a full well grown adult and can make her own decisions.*** *If she is not under a certain age, In immediate danger, a danger to others, taken against her own will, suicidal and a few other things then she can choose to disappear and there’s nothing I or anyone else can do.* *They advised me she hadn’t been in the area in years anyways.* ***They asked me on my birthday 2019 “is something wrong ma’am why do you seem so upset about your mother?” I hung up the phone. My mouth couldn’t even express the amount of emotion that was going through my heart at that moment and it all just came out as sobs…. “I’m so upset” because my mother, the woman who gave me breath and life to breathe has not been seen in almost two decades and no one can seem to see the immediate issue with that but me.*** *At this point I’m offended; I start posting to Facebook more and more. I start adding anyone and everyone with my last name or my mother’s last name. I find an awesome cousin of mine who happens to be a crime junkie living in the same state as my bio father (Maggie Snider) . She came to visit me and we went to the crime junkie showduring her visit here in Arizona. We met Sarah turney and Erin Reed after the show for drinks. I then feature on “Sipping on Some Crime Podcast”. This would be the first of many episode interviews to follow.* *I started contacting the provided emails from police websites for public records requests. I entered requests with Brevard county and Jacksonville duval county. I found an alias just by searching her jail number alone with no other info included (on inmate websites). I obtained a copy of the FDLE records request. During all of the record requests and paying for online reports from radaris and people searches.* *The trail always ends in the same exact location. 5624 Cagle Rd in Jacksonville, Florida. The location was previously a Ramada Inn and is now an Econolodge. My sister and I sent a good friend from our old church and his friend who is a licensed PI to these locations in Melbourne and in Jacksonville. I have the conclusion from those findings and they were what I’ve already sent you. Not to mention the PI was given everything that I also gave you prior to making this venture to search for my mom.* *All in all his findings were that I need to personally go to Jacksonville where my mother frequented and walk the streets of US1 to find her. He looked every which way up down left right backwards and sideways in the systems he has access to and found the same things I did. Less even.* ***Today the case is ice cold and I’m left with bits and pieces of half ass answers.*** *no one remembers anything and better yet they want nothing to do with the repercussions and or history they’d have to face in order to be even slightly involved.* ***Every single day that passes is such a heartbreak to me, my sister and those who know what a beautiful person my mother truly is because I know this life is so so short. I can only hope that my life will just be long enough to discover what truly happened to my beautiful mother Diane Theresa Francis.*** *Side note: In the year 2015, (16 years after dating and beating my mother.) John Taylor Boggs calls the Jacksonville Sheriff's office and asks if he can report someone missing. He proceeds to tell the sheriffs office that Diane is his former friend and he hasn't seen her in “12” years, and he is “worried” about her.* *He claims he is the step father of my sister and I and he hopes my mother is okay. He also proceeds to tell the sheriff's office defining facts about my mother, including her drug habits, tattoos, hair color etc. mind you this call was made one day apart from the day his neighbor and friend George Contos goes missing and is also reported missing. I’ve since found another missing individual associated with my mother’s ex boyfriend.* *Sherri Lynn Snider* Thank you for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it a lot! (Mandatory clarification: I am not associated in any way with Sherri Lynn Snider, I don't know her. I'm just a random person on the internet who has bumped into her Facebook post, noticed it only had 16 'likes' and decided to lend a helping hand by bringing her post here. I don't know how to help her in a more concrete way, unfortunately. Nobody deserves to live for almost 20 years with not knowing what happened to a person they love, so I really, really, REALLY hope that maybe this post can spark a little more interest in Sherri's Mom story.)"	20220121T113351
mrsscorsese	Which Do You Prefer?	7	0	I very much respect that CJ does a large amount of unsolved cases, in the spirit of using their platform to spread the word, rather than just being entertainment. But I’m guilty of enjoying solved cases so much more; because unsolved cases can be so frustrating. [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/s92mfe)	20220121T045046

beesintreesxx	I cannot stand when Brit brings up the Statement Analysis Blog in every episode with a 911 call.	55	0	I’m sure they do great work or whatever, but half the time, she points to signs in the calls that are suspicious but I’m over here thinking I would do the exact same thing in that situation. For example, I’m listening to “The Mysterious Death of Michelle O’Connell”, and she thinks it’s suspicious (because the blog said so), that during the 911 call he is explaining what he thinks happened to the dispatcher. Would you not do the same thing? I mean. If someone shot themselves would you not tell the dispatcher that? Lmao	20220115T150308
rejohl23	Feeling kind of scammed by Patreon…	71	0	So I just subscribed to the $5 annual tier of membership because I am finally caught up to their real time episode releases and wanted to continue my binging! I had been seeing a lot of posts and comments on here how you need to purchase the annual membership to get access to backlogged content so I said you know what, I’ll do it. I then find out with the $5 annual membership you only get access to “the $5 tier backlogged content”?????????? This seems to wild to me!! You need to subscribe to the $20 tier annual membership to get the FULL catalog of backlogged content. In other words you need to pay $240. This is partially my fault as it does say on Patreon that the $5 annual membership unlocks backlogged content in the $5 tier but still I can’t help but be disappointed. I am all for supporting podcasts that I genuinely enjoy but this is just crazy. It seems like a money grab for them instead of a perk for subscribers. Especially considering the success this podcast has had, and audiochuck in general. Since I already paid for the annual membership I’m not going to let it go to waste, but I can guarantee I won’t be doing it again!	20220114T172724
viktrya	Could my aunt have murdered my uncle?	6	0	When I was about fourteen or so, my great-uncle died. I didn't think until now that the circumstances seemed a bit off, but I'd like to get some thoughts on them anyways. My aunt and uncle lived in rural Alabama, ten to twelve hours away from where my closer family lived. My aunt has always remained quiet, reclusive, and weirdly wise. She's very intelligent, and dare I say she's an exception when it comes to other family members. She doesn't really come around to family holidays, really ever. She's on a nurse's salary, has a daughter, but she also lives in a massive house on a very large amount of land. We've suggested a few times she move closer, but she hasn't budged from the house and land. When my uncle died, he'd apparently fallen out of the shower and onto the floor, suffering an injury so severe that he ended up unresponsive in the hospital. He was a grown, able-bodied, intelligent man who worked for NASA and other companies in engineering. It had taken a long time for an ambulance to arrive after he'd crawled to the phone, seeing as the house was so far into the sticks. My uncle and my aunt bought a massive house and filled it with a beautiful kitchen, bookshelves crawling toward the ceiling, multiple bathrooms, and a small secluded bedroom that oversaw the foggy, pale orange sunrises each dawn. We make the drive with my mother's sister, and my great-aunt's daughter, who is in shambles at the possibility of losing her dad. Sobbing the whole way to the hospital for ten hours, and it broke my heart in two to hear. As the week ticks by, my aunt is relatively calm and collected. She doesn't even seem very stressed to be in the hospital, but she lingers in and out of my uncle's hospital room. He is still unresponsive, on breathing tubes, and in apparent deep bodily danger. You'd think he'd suffered far more than a fall. Halfway through the week, we're gathered by the doctor into one of those stuffy grieving rooms. He tells us that a nurse had apparently left my uncle unattended and sometime between the nurse leaving and returning, he'd suffered a fall from the bed so severe that his brain injuries are terminal and inoperable. My aunt seems, again, relatively collected and stern as she selects to take him off of life support. My cousin is again an absolute wreck knowing she'll lose her dad, but my aunt seems somewhat unbothered. There wasn't any sort of funeral apart from a small home service, and my aunt has since taken back her maiden name, no longer publicly using the name which was once hers while married. She's now going on expensive trips, eating expensive food, and posting it to social media all the time. This money wasn't hers prior to my uncle's death.	20220114T034749

anythingbutgeneric	(Rant) Patricia Viola Episode	0	0	I just finished listening to the Patricia Viola episode and it left a lot to be desired. I feel for Patricia's loved ones and her story should definitely be known. However, I get discouraged with the crime world's obsession with housewives gone missing (I won't even delve into the race of said housewives). In the episode they quickly glanced over a TRIPLE HOMICIDE that happened in the same neighborhood that involved possible hitmen targeting Rajesh Kalsaria. I just don't understand why his story was so insignificant that it was just a footnote in Patricia's story. Idk I might be overthinking this but at the very least I would've hoped that they'll cover that story separately.	20220113T190749

I like the podcast as an intro to some cases. But I do think they could be a little more conscious of updates, plus some episodes are pretty biased. I really hope faith gets her justice now they’ve identified her killer.	20220103T225117

There was a stronger case of physical evidence and arguably more public outrage against Casey Anthony and she got away with it because of him. He even got Aaron Hernandez’s conviction overturned* when the evidence against him was overwhelming. I’d love to hear some other people’s thoughts on whether or not certain counsel could sway a case like this! *It was overturned and pending a new trial when Aaron died. MA later reinstated his conviction and changed the antiquated law about throwing out a conviction if the accused dies during the appeal process.	20211223T131535

forpeachsake	“Jeff Ep”	30	0	So, I’ve been on the Patreon for a couple of years and lately I’ve been thinking of cancelling because of how shockingly bad value it is. Not a single thing ever sent in the post (At $20 a month that’s pretty bad). I’ve only been paying for a few short episodes extra a month. So I’ve been waiting to see if it picked up, but no….instead….I’m just seeing more and more flaws. So today I am listening to the Headlines episode on Patreon and realised once again Brit is referring to Jefferey Epstein as ‘Jeff Ep’. This is a regular occurrence anytime he is mentioned and it is driving me mad. It;s tacky and disrespectful and downright unprofessional. I think the CJ ship has finally sailed for me on this one.	20211215T152432

ProudDragonfly0	Brit asked I answered	60	0	Brit said she wanted to know the stats on how many kids go missing a year versus runaways, I looked into it, over 1 million kids run away a year and there were 365,348 missing kids in 2020 and 421,394 in 2019 so it makes sense that kidnapping is not always the “go to” when it makes up less than 1/2 of those instances “The nonprofit National Center for Missing & Exploited Children said it assisted law enforcement, families and child welfare agencies with 29,782 cases of missing children in 2020. Of those, 27,072 were runaways, the vast majority of whom are located quickly, said the center’s Rebecca Steinbach.”	20211210T121625

MurderSheet	Flowers: Not Just Plagiarism	210	0	A lot of people have-- quite rightfully-- criticized Ashley Flowers over the Crime Junkie plagiarism scandal. In my view, she's done something else that I think might even be more egregious that hasn't gotten nearly as much attention. She made a deal with the Indiana State Police to look at case files in the Burger Chef murders-- which they wouldn't even let the victims' families see. In exchange, she turned over complete editorial control of the resulting program-- Red Ball-- to the police. I got to see this happen in real time as I am an attorney for a family member of a victim in the case. My wife and I ended up devoting a long episode of our podcast to all of this-- laying out the details. Plus, we cover all the plagiarism stuff-- and feature interviews with Robin Warder of The Trail Went Cold, Esther Ludlow from Once Upon a Crime and Cathy Frye-- whose complaints about Flowers stealing her work set off the plagiarism scandal. If you're interested, the link is [https://art19.com/shows/murder-sheet/episodes/69f01aee-6bc4-432e-b48d-ff08e4bd2c60](https://art19.com/shows/murder-sheet/episodes/69f01aee-6bc4-432e-b48d-ff08e4bd2c60)	20211207T143432
rxswizzle	Episode help	11	0	I’m looking for the name of a specific episode. I can’t remember all the details, but a women is murdered in her home and the police are looking for a person who had her dog. His wife saw that on TV and told him to go into the police station because he had just bought her dog. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that makes it seem like he did it, and he does get sentenced. Then, in one of his appeals his lawyer has an explanation to every piece of circumstantial evidence and he gets acquitted. It really seems like he didn’t do it, but then years later there is a match for DNA that was found on the victim, and it was his. But since his case was dismissed with prejudice they can’t retry him. But, he ends up being taken to military court. I cant remember the name of him or the victim, or the episode name, thanks!	20211206T191717

pixieok	Podcast recommendations for non-native English listener.	28	0	Hello! I've been listening CJ for a few years now, I know they have some issues regarding plagiarism but I stick to it because I can understand 100% percent what they say while listening. My native language is Spanish and I'm pretty decent at writing and reading English, listening to it is a little more difficult. I've tried Casefile, which I like because it tells the story without too much rambling but his accent made a little difficult to follow him. I'm looking for other podcasts (not YT channel because I mostly listen while driving) that have a similar style: no jokes, no long intros, no rambling, one or two persons speaking with clear pronunciation about the case. Thanks!	20211205T140947

dottipants16	Help me locate an episode please!	7	0	"Hi, I'm trying to find a specific episode please! I don't remember a huge amount of detail so apologies! I also have dabbled in other pod casts so it's possible it's not even CJ! I remember a mother and child (daughter I think) and they're kidnapped and locked in a cupboard. The daughter at some point is allowed to ring her dad but can't give any details about where they are. I think they escape eventually but can't remember for certain. Any ideas? Side note, I am aware of the scandal, I also agree that Brits contributions to the episodes have declined in quality, but in spite of that I still love CJ and have yet to find a second pod cast that measures up! I've tried Big mad true crime (I like it but I also like the back and forth of the earlier CJ episodes with 2 people), murder with my husband (I cannot get on with her phrasing and the way she pronounces things) anatomy of murder (again its good but too dry and robotic) sinisterhood (loved it but the episodes are too long for my drives to work, even in 2 parts for most of them and I lose track over multiple days - shift work on odd days). I've enjoyed all the ""spin offs"" like international infamy, precedent, counterclock and solvable. Does anyone have any suggestions of others I could try?"	20211204T125447

Most recently was listening to the Robert Wone episode and they played the entire call. Even though the case sounded super interesting it made me so irrationally mad I considered skipping it. And then to find out the call was only 4 or 5 minutes long and they played the ENTIRE thing. My rage!! Lol THEN !!!! Ashley recapped the call anyway! Felt like very lazy way of extending the episode. Anyway, I know it was irrational for me to get so annoyed, just seeing if anyone else feels the same	20211203T031531

anonymous	Ed Kemper Episode	26	0	Ed Kemper is one of the serial killers I find absolutely fascinating, therefore I've read a lot of material on him. He's also one of the most researched serial killers due to the fact that he was the one who helped FBI agents, John E. Douglas and Mark Olshaker, develop profiles for these sort of killers. That being said, woo! I recently listened to their episode on him and damn did they brush over a lot! I know that it's more than likely an episode made for newer listeners who might have never heard of him before but, sheesh. They made him sound sorta meek! Thankfully they don't cover huge cases frequently because they don't do those stories any justice. I love that their show focuses more on cases many of us may have never heard of. That's why I tune in frequently - I want to hear about the people who get barely get a blip of attention or, unfortunately, any resolution.	20211201T132615

hakunamantatas	So what is this subs consensus on the Robert Wone case?	28	0	This is one of the most confusing cases I’ve heard. The presented timeline is really weird. The semen, the bathrobes, the fresh clothes on the victim, the spotless crime scene. The suggested windows of time between them discovering the body and calling 9-1-1 is weird. But then again, it seems like the authorities dragged their feet on it a little. Like them getting a warrant and taking days to execute it. The cellphone being handed over to whoever and going missing. What do you guys think? Y’all think they did that shit?	20211130T221132

123456asdfg1	Statement “analysis” is such crap	53	0	I didn’t understand the Brit hate until she -started- (well I’m binging out of order so) mentioned the statement analysis blog. My family had a suicide in the family and when my sister called the police why would she ever have said my brothers name? They (911) have no idea who he was - she just said “my brothers dead” Also my brother was alive when police and whatever arrived but my sister was crying “he’s dead hes dead” on the call. Her statement analysis bullshit always pisses me off. It’s so off base and sounds like stuff that’s written by someone who has NOOO experience in trauma - the worst so far to me as been the “analysis” of Darlie Routier’s 911 call. It sounds completely normal given circumstances	20211113T155217

What do you think happened in the case? My personal thoughts (spoilers to follow): I don’t think Robin Cho is guilty, at least not for the reasons the prosecution laid out. My best guess is that the tip letter was correct - the husband paid someone (or multiple someones) to kill the wife, and the killer / killers mixed up the nanny and the wife, explaining why the nanny and son were killed first and why they had to wait 30 minutes for the wife to return. I feel like the biggest discrepancy here would be why would the husband kill his younger son, and not the older?	20211110T215454

bvxjt	Justice for Enrique Roman-Martinez	69	0	I would like to start off by saying how greatful i am that this podcast covered Enrique’s story. His story definitely needs more attention, and i hope from this his family will get the justice they deserve! I met Enrique when we were in 7th grade, and hung out with him a lot in high school. He was a super chill, and funny guy. I remember after graduating i lost touch with him for a few months, i just thought he wasn’t active on social media and that was fine. After a while though, Enrique finally messaged me and asked how i was doing, and shared with me he had joined the army and how excited he was to be doing something important with his life. He wasn’t just doing it to make himself proud, but also did it so his mom and older sisters could be proud of him. I was beyond proud of this kid as well, seeing him go from a lil justin bieber haricut kid to a grown man now in the army lol! The last year/ couple of months on Enrique’s death, i remember him telling me to be ready to hangout and catch up because he would be coming home for christmas(2020) to surprise his family. i was excited to see him again, and catch up with how he was doing. I spoke to Enrique about 3 or 2 days before he was reported missing, and i remember we were talking about anime, and just sending eachother stupid memes. Then a few days later i seen on a mutual friends snapstory, a picture of Enrique smiling with the headline saying he was missing. I remember instantly feeling a pain in my chest and gut, before bawling in tears. i knew something had to be wrong and someone/ something had to have happened to him, especially since we had just talked. After learning about Enrique’s death/ disappearance i had the honor of meeting his family, and helping them try to get Enrique’s story and name known. His family doesn’t deserve this, he was his mother’s only son, her youngest and only son who always took care of her and his sisters no matter where he was. I hope people continue to share, and talk about Enrique’s story until justice is brought to his family. Edit: i’m a huge fan of the podcast and was very happy when i seen the episode!	20211109T195405

anonymous	What is going on with the US military?	25	0	I happened to have listened to the LaVena Johnson episode last week and I also just finished the most recent release. What in god's name is going on with how crimes are dealt with on military bases or how the death of personnel are treated? I'm genuinely wondering what the reasoning is behind either quickly closing these cases and/or releasing little to no information concerning ongoing investigations. I have a few theories but I'm curious as to what everyone here thinks. Side note: my husband's friend is in the military. I don't know all of the details to this story but one of his fellow soldiers killed his wife & returned to base like nothing happened. The man was arrested and sentenced but there was barely a peep in the media. So, obviously, this seems to be a consistent issue at all branches.	20211109T032005

morganebony_	Why don’t they reach out to families who are clearly willing to talk about their loved ones case?	13	0	I’m only very new here (a few days) but have been binging CJ for 2-3 months and am up to the Ryan Shtuka episode. I’m not going to single out either host here, I think they are fine and I don’t know them personally so I’m not willing to comment on them as people but I am comfortable commenting on the show as a whole. I think it must actually be quite hard to put together any form of long form production weekly, when they are talking for (generally) 45+ minutes I think that’s a feat on its own, even if it’s not entirely researched as well as it could be. I could barely put together a 5 minute speech for University and I had a week, I can even imagine putting together something that goes for 45+. I was hoping their would be an entire reddit page for Ryan so I could read more theories and participate in discussion about his case. He doesn’t have a reddit page, but I did find the corrections his mother made and honestly I’m shocked. I always enjoyed hearing how they made donations to worthy charities to genuinely try help victims families. I think it’s great they are supporting genealogy testing and DNA doe. I don’t listen to a TON of true crime since I’m generally binging an entire show before starting something else, but Casefile is my all time favourite (I’m also Australian and I love the amount of Australian cases he covers). That being said, he is very “clinical”, doesn’t really talk about anything outside of the case itself. I like that Ash and Brit are giving information about charities to support and making donations themselves. I think this is genuine despite a lot of people maybe having other thoughts. My problem is they mention how involved Ryan’s mum/family are about his case. I also found out she has actually done at least one podcast interview before on his case. Why didn’t Ash and Brit reach out? Why didn’t they go directly to the source themselves? They talk so much about helping victims, why didn’t they make sure the information was accurate? His mum seems more than willing to discuss his case and keep it out there in peoples minds so I’m sure she would have AT LEAST provided them an accurate timeline of the events over email or something even if she wasn’t comfortable being on the podcast itself. Maybe they could have even audio called her and recorded it so they could get details from her directly and not have to have shared the audio. They would have something to go back on and re-listen to as much as they needed. I think Ash and Brit do genuinely care about victims. I just think they have bitten off more than they can chew. I think it must be hard putting together an entire case like they do weekly (I understand they are working on multiple cases at once behind the scenes) and writing a 45+ minute long script. However, for me at least, having his mum on the podcast or at least CONSULTING her would have absolutely made their job EASIER. They don’t need to research the case when his mum is literally telling them everything they could ever want to know, maybe stuff that hasn’t even been made public or heavily reported on. For me there is absolutely 0 reason why they got facts wrong here. I understand human error and maybe they just genuinely misinterpreted some information. I would understand if the mother/family were deceased or moved on and didn’t want to talk, but his mum seems VERY willing to talk about it. In my humble opinion, unless his mother specifically turned down their request to talk/interview, I don’t understand why they wouldn’t consult her. If the mother didn’t want to, that’s absolutely her right. However I think there is no excuse to why Ash and Brit shouldn’t have reached out in this situation. I think they have bitten off more than they can chew with all the other shows. I believe the other day on Instagram that they have 11 members of staff. That doesn’t seem like enough? I could be wrong, I don’t know how much it takes to put multiple podcasts together but I think unfortunately it’s impacting the show when they have to focus so much energy into other things as well.	20211108T161223

PresentLink2799	"**Gripe** - I'm sympathetic to the plagiarism boycott and I have questions about other audio chuck productions/""Something was wrong"""	26	0	"It's been a while since I posted in this group. I'm not sure if the rules have changed. In my post from months ago, someone mentioned that all this group is now is complaints. Today, when I came back, I saw that another person was separating episodes out between gripes vs. theories and I thought that was an excellent compromise! So I'm trying to mimic. Anyway - not interested in being told to stop complaining but also don't want people to consume something that makes them tired. Anyway, I do fall on the ""I've stopped listening to Crime Junkie once I understood how bad the plagiarism scandal truly was"" camp. Today I listened to two episodes of ""Something was wrong"" and these women and their stories......dear God, I know these women. They just feel so accessible. And it's so brave what they share and I really just don't judge them, at all. This is the first time in a while, I've listened to something and been like, ""I get it."" Ashley Flowers doesn't host it but it is an audiochuck production, I just realized. People of a similar mindset to me - do you listen to other audiochuck productions? Or do you try to completely disavow the whole company? I don't fully understand how podcasts make their money but the idea of doing anything that could financially benefit Ashley Flowers bums me out because I think she's yet to fully atone."	20211105T041009

lazyb1tch	Favorite episode?	23	0	Does anyone have a favorite episode that they listen to more than once? Maybe because it’s interesting? Mine is the episode about Charlie Brandt. It’s so crazy and interesting and no matter how many times I listen to it I can’t wrap my head around it.	20211104T140952

paulbufano_420	Thankful I’m not a podcaster	297	0	I’ve listened to CJ for about a year. Like any other media, it’s not perfect. But damn, y’all are ruthless on this subreddit! How many threads do we need about finding Brit or Ashley’s voices annoying? Y’all know these are real people?? who started this as a passion project & it got bigger than they thought it would, quickly?! If I were them and I saw this subreddit, I would be devastated & probably want to just quit. No one is making you listen, so why be a jerk & knock down other women (I know most of y’all are women too) when you could just move on? It’s sad and entitled and rude and I hope y’all never get shit on the way y’all do Brit & Ashley without a second thought (while calling yourselves fans!!) If u wanna be critical of someone, here are a few ideas: billionaires, corrupt politicians, your local police force, your local school board, celebrities who use their platforms to spread hate, etc. Go do something useful, ya dorks	20211103T021029

RainLate9695	Brit Changed - Theory	68	0	I’m listening to earlier episodes and Brit is sooo different. She is not scripted like now and has way more personality than Ashley, but did border on not being considerate. Ashley’s annoyance is palpable to me. I have always - old and new episodes - felt Ashley is a stuck up chick who doesn’t like when other people shine over her. I now theorize she made Brit her side chick bc she didn’t have the confidence to do the podcast alone, but censored her and tailored her to basically let Ashley be the star. I could also be way off. Just theories!	20211102T173209

tatiii32	Headlines Episodes	1	0	So I’ve been a low tier patreon member for like a year now … I recently upgraded bc I’m all caught up on episodes but I’m sooooo annoyed that they don’t unlock all of the precious bonus content unless I pay for the whole year up front. I’ve already been a paying freakin member for like a year 🙄 So basically I feel I wasted my money. Can we all just go in together on a premium account for a few bucks & share an account? Lol Also, there has to be somewhere on the internet that leaks the headlines episodes, right? Lol	20211101T205806

forpeachsake	True Crime Obsessed	18	0	Just curious…..did Ashley/Brit have a falling out with Patrick and Gillian from True Crime Obsessed? I first discovered True Crime Obsessed when Crime Junkie would plug it all the time back in the day. TCO ended up becoming my absolute favorite Podcast. Patrick and Gillian are awesome and, unlike Crime Junkie, they really give back to their Patreon subscribers with so much content, even sending gifts in the mail etc, which is much better the really poor content and interactions CJ put out (CJ is a company with a multi-million dollar net worth and yet they give so little in the way of content and nothing in the way of showing appreciation to the loyal patreon followers). However, that’s not really what I’m here to ask I just wanted to throw that out there. Back on topic…. So, I remember Ashley (CJ) and Patrick (TCO) in particular would always post on social about being BFF’s and how they were great friends etc. Then it all seemed to stop. I haven;t heard either CJ or TCO mention the other in forever. I went looking, out of curiosity, and saw that Patrick and Ashley don’t follow each other on social. Does anyone know anything about this? Was there a public falling out? I’m really nosey and would love to hear the scoop.	20211026T192345
