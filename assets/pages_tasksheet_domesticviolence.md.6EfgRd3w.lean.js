There are studies that suggest that DV became especially problematic during the Covid19 pandemic with its long lockdowns. The United Nations have called this <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/in-focus-gender-equality-in-covid-19-response/violence-against-women-during-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the &quot;shadow pandemic&quot;</a> (UN Women, n.d.). However, domestic violence often remains under-discussed or misrepresented in mainstream media. The rise of podcasts has provided an accessible space for victims to share their stories, discuss resources, and raise awareness. In this case study, you can analyse how digital platforms enable conversations surrounding an issue silenced by stigma and fear. In addition, you can try and apply some of the theoretical approaches discussed in class. Domestic violence disproportionately affects women, and the gendered nature of this violence shapes public discourse. This could lead to a feminist reading of your data. In addition, domestic violence does not affect all social groups in the same way. Survivors of colour, LGBTQIA+ individuals, immigrants, mothers with small children, unemployed people, or those with disabilities experience special challenges and may find it particularly hard to seek help or walk away from an abusive relationship. Also, domestic violence is treated differently by different legal systems. This could also be analysed from a postcolonial perspective.</p><h2 id="podcasts-communicating-domestic-violence-awareness" tabindex="-1">Podcasts communicating domestic violence awareness <a class="header-anchor" href="#podcasts-communicating-domestic-violence-awareness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Podcasts communicating domestic violence awareness&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Podcasts have become a powerful tool for survivor voices and to raise general awareness about domestic violence.
