As James W. Loewen (2017) wrote , &quot;we are a product of our history ‚Äî even the history we don‚Äôt like to think about&quot; (adapted from the first chapter of <em>Understanding and Teaching American Slavery</em>, published in <a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/spring-2017/what-learning-about-slavery-can-teach-us-about-ourselves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Learning for Justice, Issue 55, Spring 2017</a>). Slavery undoubtedly is a global phenomenon that shaped the cultures and economic fortunes of many present-day countries and communities. One lasting challenge that cannot be detached from slavery is racism. Loewen reminds us in his article:</p><blockquote><p>In the United States, as a legal and social system, slavery ended between 1863 and 1865, depending upon where one lived. Unfortunately, racism, slavery‚Äôs handmaiden, did not. In turn, white supremacy, the ideology that slavery begot, caused the Democratic Party to label itself the ‚Äúwhite man‚Äôs party‚Äù for almost a century, into the 1920s. Also during the 1920s, white supremacy led to the ‚Äúscience‚Äù of eugenics (human breeding), IQ and SAT testing, and restrictions on the immigration of ‚Äúinferior races‚Äù from southern and eastern Europe as well as Asia and Africa (Loewen, 2017).</p></blockquote><p>For media studies students, working with slavery-related data from the past can, therefore, be a way to better understand ongoing legacies of colonial power and (problematic) media portrayals of different ethnic and social groups today. It is also important to remember that slave trade and slavery were sustained by many agents, including people from countries which we would consider small and of lesser influence today. One example is the Dutch involvement in the slave trade, which can be overlooked when the focus is on the English-speaking world. According to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://slaveryandremembrance.org/articles/article/?id=A0145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Slavery and Remembrance</a> website, &quot;the Dutch transported about half a million Africans across the Atlantic&quot; between 1596 and 1829. Moreoever, they shipped &quot;about a half million Africans to their settlements in Dutch Guiana, notably Suriname, where they worked primarily on sugar plantations&quot; (The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, n.d.).</p><h2 id="data-sets-related-to-historical-slavery" tabindex="-1">Data sets related to historical slavery <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-sets-related-to-historical-slavery" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data sets related to historical slavery&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The broader topic of slavery offers many opportunities for data analysis, either based on historical records or based on modern perceptions and debates. On the internet, you will find several projects dedicated to making records from the colonial period accessible.

What do they reveal about power structures of the past and persisting inequalities today?</li><li>What groups of people play a particular role in your data? You may want to look for merchants, soldiers, administrators, plantation owners, scientists, journalists, clerics, or teachers. When looking for the enslaved people mentioned, are they predominantly male or female? What is their age? Are children and entire families mentioned?</li><li>How do descriptions of slaves in your chosen records reflect past and / or present societal attitudes toward certain ethnic and social groups?</li><li>What role does intersectionality play in understanding the experiences and treatment of enslaved individuals?</li><li>What justifications are given for slavery and / or involvement in the slave trade? Who voices these justifications and can you find any counter-narratives in your sources?</li><li>What implications does studying the slave trade have for current anti-racist, decolonial, and human rights advocacy today?</li></ul><p>In addition to using multiple tools in Voyant, consider using additional data sets for comparative analysis. Look for recurring patterns in language use, e.g. when it comes to descriptions of enslaved people. Also try and identify minority voices / conflicting opinions and discuss why or why not they have been heard.</p><h3 id="cited-works-and-further-readings" tabindex="-1">Cited Works and Further Readings <a class="header-anchor" href="#cited-works-and-further-readings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Cited Works and Further Readings&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Baggesgaard, M.
