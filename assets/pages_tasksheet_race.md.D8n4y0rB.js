Understanding how race interacts with other social factors, such as gender, class, and nationality, is crucial for addressing inequality and promoting social justice. As the publishers summarised Michael Root&#39;s (2007) chapter <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444515421500234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Race in the social sciences</a> for <em>Philosophy of Anthropology and Sociology, a volume in Handbook of the Philosophy of Science</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Social scientists have a reason to use race as a descriptive or analytic category in their studies of individual differences in a social or economic trait even if they disapprove of racial classification or dream of a day when people are not classified by race or when a person&#39;s race makes no difference to her social or economic status (Elsevier, 2007).</p></blockquote><p>Social sciences research focussing on race and related aspects can, ideally, help us overcome persisting discriminations against certain groups and contribute to more inclusive public and private institutions.</p><h2 id="code-switch-podcast-example" tabindex="-1"><em>Code Switch</em> podcast example <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-switch-podcast-example" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;*Code Switch* podcast example&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/code-switch/id1112190608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Code Switch</a>, a podcast produced by NPR (2016–present), has sparked many online discussions on race, culture, and identity. Hosted by a diverse team of journalists, <em>Code Switch</em> presents the realities of race in America and beyond.
