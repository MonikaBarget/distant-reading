Unfortunately, the way in which Google News entries are ranked is not entirely transparent. The <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/9606702?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Publisher Help Center</a> states that &quot;ranking in Google News is determined algorithmically&quot; and mentions &quot;relevance of content&quot;, &quot;prominence&quot;, &quot;authoritativeness&quot;, &quot;freshness&quot;, &quot;location&quot; and &quot;language&quot; as the most important factors. However, criteria such as &quot;freshness&quot; are not specified and scraping of news items shows that many articles are ranked highly for several days in a row. This is why working with Google News always requires a critical reflection on the data retrieved.</p><h2 id="overview-of-available-google-news-api-scraper-on-github" tabindex="-1">Overview of available Google News API scraper on Github <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview-of-available-google-news-api-scraper-on-github" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview of available Google News API scraper on Github&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Github has a helpful <a href="https://github.com/topics/google-news-scraper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">overview of code and apps</a> that can be used to scrape Google News. Most of these respositories provide information on scraping metadata, but not the actual text behind the articles (see information below). A considerable number of the scripts for extracting news via the Google API are written in Python, a programming language that is very popular in the digital humanities and social sciences.</p><h2 id="options-to-scrape-content-by-time-or-region" tabindex="-1">options to scrape content by time or region <a class="header-anchor" href="#options-to-scrape-content-by-time-or-region" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;options to scrape content by time or region&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Several forum discussions, e.g. on Stackoverflow, cover the different scraping options for Google News and the challenges they may pose. The parameters that the Google News API allows for data selection are documented <a href="https://serpapi.com/google-news-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. One problem is that Google News now only permit a collection of 100 items max. per query, and it is unfortunately not possible to scrape news by the hour (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73072802/web-scraping-articles-from-google-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this question</a> on Stackoverflow and the relevant responses. The smallest time frame that can be selected is one day. But collecting news across a longer time frame is still possible when looping through a longer period of time. It can also help to combine scraping data per day with scraping data per country as the default setting in Google news is to collect US news.</p><p>To scrape Google news by country, you can iterate through the list of countries in which Google services are supported. The full list of countries is available for download here: <a href="https://serpapi.com/google-countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://serpapi.com/google-countries</a></p><p>However, in many cases, all countries across the world are shown the exact same news items, especially where international crises are concerned. Testing data scraping for an MA thesis, the student found that Afghanisatan and Australia, for instance, were shown the exact same top-60 news items for the keyword &quot;Gaza&quot; on October 7, 2023, to October 8, 2023, shortly after the conflict between Israel and Palestine escalated:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>title</th><th>published date</th><th>publisher.title</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Hamas surprise attack out of Gaza stuns Israel and leaves hundreds dead in fighting, retaliation - The Associated Press</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>The Associated Press</td></tr><tr><td>In focus: The war in Gaza - UN Women</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>UN Women</td></tr><tr><td>Timeline of conflict between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza - Reuters</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Reuters</td></tr><tr><td>Netanyahu says Israel is ‘at war’ after Hamas launches surprise air and ground attack from Gaza - CNN</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>CNN</td></tr><tr><td>Israel-Palestine escalation updates: Gaza under bombardment</td><td>Israel War on Gaza News - Al Jazeera English</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td></tr><tr><td>Israel/OPT: Civilians on both sides paying the price of unprecedented escalation in hostilities between Israel and Gaza ... - amnesty.org</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>amnesty.org</td></tr><tr><td>What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza? - BBC.com</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 15:58:40 GMT</td><td>BBC.com</td></tr><tr><td>Israel battles Hamas militants as death toll nears 1,200 - The Associated Press</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>The Associated Press</td></tr><tr><td>Facts and figures: Women and girls during the war in Gaza - UN Women</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>UN Women</td></tr><tr><td>Why this Israel-Gaza conflict is so complicated for Biden - CNN</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>CNN</td></tr><tr><td>Israel retaliates after Hamas attacks, deaths pass 1100 - Reuters</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Reuters</td></tr><tr><td>Israel declares state of war, attacks on Gaza intensify - Al Jazeera English</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Al Jazeera English</td></tr><tr><td>Israel retaliation kills 230 Palestinians after Hamas operation - Al Jazeera English</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Al Jazeera English</td></tr><tr><td>Israel formally declares war against Hamas as it battles to push militants off its soil - CNN</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>CNN</td></tr><tr><td>Israel vows &#39;mighty vengeance&#39; after surprise attack - Reuters</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Reuters</td></tr><tr><td>The history of Gaza in 2 minutes - CNN</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>CNN</td></tr><tr><td>Fears of a ground invasion of Gaza grow as Israel vows ‘mighty vengeance’ - Al Jazeera English</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Al Jazeera English</td></tr><tr><td>Gaza Strip suffers deadliest day in 15 years after Hamas attack - Reuters</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Reuters</td></tr><tr><td>Israel-Hamas war updates: Death toll rises as Israeli jets pound Gaza - Al Jazeera English</td><td>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Al Jazeera English</td></tr><tr><td>War grips Israel, Gaza after surprise Hamas attack and Israeli retaliation - PBS NewsHour</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>PBS NewsHour</td></tr><tr><td>Israel-Palestine history: The deep roots of the Israel-Gaza conflict - Vox.com</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>Vox.com</td></tr><tr><td>Israel-Gaza Conflict: Air-Raid Sirens in Israel Warn of Continued Strikes on Sunday - The New York Times</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>The New York Times</td></tr><tr><td>Gaza Has Suffered Under 16-Year Blockade - The New York Times</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>The New York Times</td></tr><tr><td>What to know as conflict erupts between Hamas and Israel after deadly attack, retaliation - PBS NewsHour</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>PBS NewsHour</td></tr><tr><td>Desert horror: Music festival goers heard rockets, then Gaza militants fired on them and took hostages - CNN</td><td>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT</td><td>CNN</td></tr><tr><td>What happened in Israel?
