It refers to the practice of affluent nations exporting their waste, including plastics, e-waste or used fashion, to poorer countries. This practice, critics argue, disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations and ecosystems. As developed nations reduce waste in their own countries, also to meet environmental goals in the face of climate change, they often ship their garbage to the Global South, which gives the problem a (post)colonial dimension (The Or Foundation, n.d.).</p><img src="https://mikroplastik.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Basliksiz-1.jpg" alt="book cover waste" style="float:left;width:20%;"><p>Several academic books now give an introduction to waste colonialism, often focussing on specific aspects such as plastic waste exports.

According to their <a href="https://theor.org/mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mission</a>, this foundation is &quot;a public charity in the USA and a registered charity in Ghana that has been operating in both countries since 2011&quot; and helps disadvantaged groups and regions &quot;escape the predominant violent socio-economic system of corporate colonialism and to change it from within.&quot; (The Or Foundation, n.d.). In this effort, the vision of the Or Foundation aligns with many other NGOs fighting global waste problems, e.g. in the Pacific Ocean, and of scientists that track the journeys of waste from country to country. Although their playlist is not suitable for text analysis per se, it can lead you to similar YouTube content with a sufficient number of comments. You can also search for terms like &quot;waste export&quot;, &quot;fast fashion&quot; or &quot;climate colonialism&quot; to find interesting videos.</p><h3 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>The Or Foundation.
