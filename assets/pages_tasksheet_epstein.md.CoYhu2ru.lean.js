The Epstein abuse cases made international news because Epstein, supported by his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, build a high-profile network of rich and famous men exploiting vulnerable women, above all young girls and women from difficult backgrounds. Feminist analysis of how the Epstein case was discussed in 2019 when reporting peaked can help us understand how societal structures of power and privilege enable such exploitation.
