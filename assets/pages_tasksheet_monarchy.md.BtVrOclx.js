In 2022, as the United Kingdom first celebrated Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s Platinum Jubilee and also mourned her death a few months after, a number of voices discussed the complexity of the monarchy’s legacy and debated whether this institution had a future at all. The jubilee in the summer and the funeral in September 2022 sparked debates on both sides of the spectrum: While supporters celebrated the Queen as a symbol of continuity and unity, others critiqued her role in upholding traditional societal structures and imperial inequalities.</p><p>The British Empire, which reached its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries, spanned smaller regions within Europe as well as vast territories in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The monarchy’s role in this empire cannot be separated from the economic exploitation, cultural erasure, and political subjugation that many colonised peoples experienced. Yet, Queen Elizabeth II herself, as head of the Commonwealth established when most colonies gained independence, has also been seen as a figurehead in postcolonial discussions about friendship and new collaborations in the later 20th century.</p><p>It is interesting to find out how the international Twittersphere reacted to the Queen&#39;s funeral and King Charles&#39;s accession, paying particular attention to (post)colonial themes. Scraping the trending hashtag #AbolishMonarchy between 8 and 19 September 2022, we have collected a data set that reflects mostly negative perceptions of the British monarchy. Not all of the anti-monarchist sentiments voiced in these tweets are, of course, directly related to colonial history. They can include other social and moral concerns such as the high expenses of the royal family or scandals surrounding the Queen&#39;s children. At the time, alleged racism towards Prince Harry&#39;s wife Meghan made headlines, and Prince Andrew&#39;s involvement with sex-offender Jeffrey Eppstein had also come to public attention.</p><p>It will be your task to dive deeper into this data using Voyant Tools to see if more specific postcolonial elements can be uncovered. You will need to look beyond some of the more obvious terms and pay attention to mentions of race, national identity, or the monarchy&#39;s present-day connection to authoritarian regimes abroad.</p><p><strong>Data Sets (collected via the Twitter API)</strong></p><p>The data set was collected via the Twitter API in 2022 and is available as both a CSV file (including metadata) and a TXT file for distant reading. Some tweets are very short and emotional, consisting only in keywords that describe people&#39;s rejection of the monarchy, e.g.:</p><blockquote><p>Unelected. Undemocratic. Unaccountable. Unnecessary.</p></blockquote><p>Other tweets refer to specific historical details which you may need to research further, for example:</p><blockquote><p>$45 Trillion was stolen from India alone, Shree Paradkar is right.</p></blockquote><p>Also, most tweets use more than one hashtag, and you should also consider why certain other hashtags beyond #AbolishMonarchy were chosen, and what they mean in a postcolonial context, e.g.:</p><blockquote><p>#WhyNotScotland</p></blockquote><p><strong>Questions for Data Analysis</strong></p><p>Here are some research questions to explore through Voyant Tools, which will help uncover key themes and sentiments in the data:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is the emotional tone of the tweets about the Queen’s Jubilee?</strong></p><p>Are people’s reactions to the jubilee generally positive, negative, or mixed? Use sentiment analysis tools in Voyant to identify emotional trends and key phrases linked to different sentiments (e.g., &quot;love,&quot; &quot;pride,&quot; &quot;anger,&quot; &quot;resentment&quot;).</p></li><li><p><strong>What is the relationship between colonialism and the monarchy in these conversations?</strong></p><p>How do tweets link the monarchy to historical colonial power? Which regions or countries discuss colonialism most frequently? Use Voyant&#39;s &quot;co-occurrence&quot; tools (e.g. Links and Terms Berry) to analyse which terms often appear alongside “empire” or “colonial.”</p></li><li><p><strong>How do users from former colonies engage with the monarchy compared to users in the UK?</strong></p><p>Is there a difference in how people from the Global South and those from the UK view the monarchy? Compare the frequency of critical versus celebratory tweets, as well as the use of terms like “reparations,” “independence,” and “sovereignty.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Is there a connection between #abolishmonarchy and demands for decolonisation?</strong></p><p>Are demands for abolishing the monarchy mostly associated with particular critiques of the colonial past or neocolonial trends today?</p></li><li><p><strong>What role does the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee play in postcolonial identity?</strong></p><p>How do people frame the jubilee in terms of identity and national consciousness? Are there references to modern-day struggles for independence, such as debates over reparations or royal apologies?</p></li></ol><p><strong>Idea for Further Data Analysis: The Legacy of the Monarchy in Popular Media</strong></p><p>Beyond social media, it could be valuable to explore how popular media narratives, such as documentaries, dramatised films, and books, shape postcolonial discourses about the monarchy. For example, the ITV documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj90yqcyb9k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Queen’s Green Planet</a> offers a positive view of the monarchy’s role in environmentalism and diplomacy that may hide more controversial aspects. By contrast, the Netflix series <em>The Crown</em> presents royal history as a soap opera with a focus on family entanglements and personal tragedies.<br> Exploring how viewers react to such narratives, e.g. in YouTube comments, can be an interesting topic to explore in a final essay.</p><p><strong>Cited Works and Further Readings:</strong></p><ul><li>Hall, C.
