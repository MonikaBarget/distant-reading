This API is primarily intended for business analytics, not research. Most personal data is inaccessible.</p><h3 id="instagram" tabindex="-1">Instagram <a class="header-anchor" href="#instagram" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Instagram&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Similar to Facebook, Instagram prohibits data scraping. Only limited public content is available through Instagram’s API. Access is designed mainly for business insights rather than academic research.</p><h3 id="whatsapp" tabindex="-1">WhatsApp <a class="header-anchor" href="#whatsapp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;WhatsApp&quot;">​</a></h3><p>WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption prohibits any form of data scraping, including metadata collection. Also, the service is understood as a protected messaging service, even when hundreds of people gather in groups and channels. Data collection is entirely forbidden for both privacy and security reasons.</p><p>⚠️ Scraping any Meta platform without explicit permission violates the terms and can lead to legal actions by Meta.</p>',10)]))}const g=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
