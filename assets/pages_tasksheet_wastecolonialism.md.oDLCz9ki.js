It refers to the practice of affluent nations exporting their waste, including plastics, e-waste or used fashion, to poorer countries. This practice, critics argue, disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations and ecosystems. As developed nations reduce waste in their own countries, also to meet environmental goals in the face of climate change, they often ship their garbage to the Global South, which gives the problem a (post)colonial dimension.</p><h2 id="case-study-waste-impact-in-the-pacific-islands" tabindex="-1">Case Study: Waste Impact in the Pacific Islands <a class="header-anchor" href="#case-study-waste-impact-in-the-pacific-islands" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Case Study: Waste Impact in the Pacific Islands&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One data set that can give us an insight how different user communities online discuss the issue of waste exports to the Global South can be the comments left under videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9MlUgj6K-_ihjD1IlNvjS4uKI6Q--xjP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stop Waste Colonialism YouTube playlist</a> curated by the Or Foundation.
