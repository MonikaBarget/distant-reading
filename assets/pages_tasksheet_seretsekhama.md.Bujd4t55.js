In the 1940s, when Seretse met Ruth, Serowe was part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which was established by the UK in 1885 and, after independence, became the Republic of Botswana.</p><p>The couple faced many obstacles and discriminations although Seretse Khama came from a royal African family and received an excellent education, studying law in England (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.-a). Have things changed since Botswana`s indepencende in the 1960s, and can couples coming from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds now enjoy a better life? Have opinions about the relationship between Seretse and Ruth changed over time? And what can we learn from how their relationship was and is discussed in terms of a larger postcolonial discourse?</p><p>The data sets suggested below may help you get some insights.</p><h2 id="data-sets-youtube-and-apple-reviews" tabindex="-1">Data sets (YouTube and Apple Reviews) <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-sets-youtube-and-apple-reviews" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data sets (YouTube and Apple Reviews)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>On YouTube, Monika has collected four videos with comments in English that cover the (family) life of Seretse Khama in the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5XPG366xWVs4-pGWgNu2NLw__olk9I8E&amp;si=KNrZLoROgJUEQDcI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Digital Cultures - Seretse Khama</a> playlist (Digital History, n.d.).
