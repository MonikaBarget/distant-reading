The Epstein abuse cases made international news because Epstein, supported by his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, build a high-profile network of rich and famous men exploiting vulnerable women, above all young girls and women from difficult backgrounds. Feminist analysis of how the Epstein case was discussed in 2019 when reporting peaked can help us understand how societal structures of power and privilege enable such exploitation. We can also reflect on the role of female collaborators in male predatory behaviour. Above all, the Epstein scandal still makes headlines now, and the full scope of the abuse network has not yet been uncovered.</p><p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who died by suicide in 2025, accused many international stars and political leaders of involvement in Epstein&#39;s circle in various interviews she gave during her lifetime, but also in her autobiography <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/480517/nobodys-girl-by-giuffre-virginia-roberts/9781529985245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Nobody&#39;s Girl</a>, which was posthumously published. Through her unfaltering testimonies, Virginia Roberts Giuffre also contributed to the public downfall of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, both of whom were close friends of Epstein&#39;s and Maxwell&#39;s.</p><h2 id="reactions-to-interviews-and-documentaries-on-youtube" tabindex="-1">Reactions to interviews and documentaries on YouTube <a class="header-anchor" href="#reactions-to-interviews-and-documentaries-on-youtube" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reactions to interviews and documentaries on YouTube&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The first source to analyse in the Epstein case are viewer reactions to the various interviews and documentaries on YouTube. In addition to interviews with Epstein&#39;s victims such as Virginia Roberts Giuffre, YouTube features the infamous BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew, in which the member of the British Royal Family unsuccessfully tried to refute allegations that Roberts Giuffre and other underage girls had been trafficked to him for sex. Most shockingly for viewers, Prince Andrew showed no sympathy with Epstein&#39;s victims and played down his actions repeatedly, calling them &quot;unbecoming&quot; instead of openly labelling them as crimes. The interview turned public opinion in Britain against the Prince and forced the Royal Family to remove him from important functions.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/LNLQmpT4oQ0?si=ssXn0qg8ITxvO-0K" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/LNLQmpT4oQ0/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Exposing Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking empire | 60 Minutes Australia"></a></p><p>The <em>60 Minutes Australia</em> interview with Roberts Giuffre originally aired in 2019 but has now been re-posted by the TV station. 765,358 viewers watched it in just three days and left over 3000 comments.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QtBS8COhhhM/0.jpg" alt="Prince Andrew &amp; the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview - BBC News"></a></p><p>The interview with Prince Andrew had 56,626 comments by November 2025.</p><p>Both data sets can be used individually or in comparison to better understand the public outcry about abuse that remains unreported and unpunished for too long.

What other elements beyond gender matter?</li><li>What do listeners think about the role of law enforcement and the judicial system in preventing abuse and punishing abusers?</li><li>What implications does the Epstein case have for feminist activism and advocacy regarding sexual violence and trafficking?</li></ul><p>Please make sure to use several different tools in Voyant.
