On the other hand, the self-perceptions of individuals embracing magic and seeing themselves as practisioners of witchcraft can tell us something about (alternative) spirituality, self-empowerment, and attempts to reconnect with (marginalised) traditions. In many historical and cultural contexts, witchcraft is also a highly gendered concept, which creates opportunities for feminist and intersectional readings.</p><h2 id="sources-on-witchcraft-and-witch-trials" tabindex="-1">Sources on witchcraft and witch trials <a class="header-anchor" href="#sources-on-witchcraft-and-witch-trials" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sources on witchcraft and witch trials&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Data sets related to witchcraft and witch trials can range from historical records to modern (pop-cultural) perceptions and present-day witchcraft controversies in regions like the Congo, where children and teenagers (from poor backgrounds) are often accused and banished from their homes.

This is a positive development. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach these practices with respect and awareness of their origins and meanings (Petter, 2024, para. 13).</p></blockquote><p>Also, the article addresses challenges of commercialisation (e.g. the sale of overpriced equipment such as crystal balls) and unrealistic expectations (Petter, 2024).

Using the Python scripts shared in this repository or other tools for web-scraping, you should be able to assemble an interesting data set of user reactions and debates related to modern witchcraft for text analysis.</p><p>Here, it may be interesting to include how people respond to popcultural depictions of witches in comics, films and novels.
