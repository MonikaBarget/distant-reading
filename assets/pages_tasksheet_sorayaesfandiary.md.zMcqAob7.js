People from both cultures may question their belonging and push them to &quot;choose sides&quot;, which can lead to feelings of alienation. Hybrid identities are common in our globalised world but especially challenging when individuals have to navigate between cultures whose shared history is marked by war and oppression. Postcolonial theory can help us understand how these individuals engage with their heritage and how they respond to expectations. One interesting historical personality who had to navigate a hybrid identity was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soraya_Esfandiary-Bakhtiary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary</a>, who was Queen of Iran as the second wife of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Born in 1932, Soraya came from a Persian noble family in diplomatic service. She was raised in Berlin and Isfahan, and educated in London and Switzerland. She spent significant time in both Iran and Europe, which later led to tensions regarding her public persona as queen. She attempted to reconcile her royal responsibilities with her personal interests and Western influences. Her fashion choices, public appearances, and modern lifestyle contrasted with traditional expectations, while she also struggled to fully understand the lives and ideas of less educated Iranians, e.g. those from rural backgrounds. Simultaneously, perceptions of her life vary considerably to this day, and many fictional accounts in novels and film do not do the complexity of her story justice. Analysing how different groups speak about Soraya today can give us interesting insights into challenges of identity in a globalised world but also shed light on persisting stereotypes towards women and Iranian society.</p><h2 id="data-set-on-youtube" tabindex="-1">Data set on YouTube <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-set-on-youtube" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data set on YouTube&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the YouTube playlist <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5XPG366xWVvfpXZh_joch7pZp2ubV9w_&amp;si=Xp1EaM2EgDo_5wh7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Digital Cultures - Soraya</a>, Monika has collected five different videos on Saraya&#39;s life and its pop-cultural perceptions with user comments (mostly) in English.
