This can, indeed, be a great add-on to other visualisation techniques in text analysis, but it is often difficult to accomplish. Tools like <strong>Voyant</strong> offer features for creating maps from text, such as <a href="http://www.voyant-tools.org/docs/tutorial-dreamscape.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DreamScape</a>. However, this tool only works well in a minority of use cases.</p><h3 id="challenges-with-voyant-s-dreamscape" tabindex="-1">Challenges with Voyant’s DreamScape <a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-with-voyant-s-dreamscape" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Challenges with Voyant’s DreamScape&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li><strong>Lack of contextual analysis</strong>: DreamScape does not analyze the context in which place names appear. This can lead to inaccuracies, such as plotting <strong>personal names as places</strong> if they resemble geographic terms.</li><li><strong>Anglophone bias</strong>: DreamScape tends to work best with English-language texts and is more effective at identifying places in the <strong>UK and US</strong>. Non-English place names or locations outside these regions may not be recognized accurately or at all.</li><li><strong>Ambiguity in place names</strong>: Many place names are shared across different regions or countries. Without contextual clues, DreamScape may misidentify or misplace these locations on the map.</li></ol><h3 id="better-alternatives-for-mapping" tabindex="-1">Better alternatives for mapping <a class="header-anchor" href="#better-alternatives-for-mapping" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Better alternatives for mapping&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For more accurate and reliable map-making, beginner tools like <a href="https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Palladio</a> are often a better choice. Unlike Voyant, Palladio requires you to <strong>create your own spreadsheet</strong> of verified place names and their coordinates first. This is, of course, more time-consuming but ensures that you have full control over the data and that only accurate information will be shown. If you’re working with texts that contain diverse or non-standard place names, investing time in preparing a verified dataset for tools like Palladio will yield far more reliable and insightful visualizations.</p>',7)]))}const g=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,g as default};
