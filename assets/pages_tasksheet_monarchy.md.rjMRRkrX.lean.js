In September 2022, as the United Kingdom celebrated Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s Platinum Jubilee, a number of voices discussed the complexity of the monarchy’s legacy, particularly regarding its colonial past. The jubilee sparked debates on both sides of the spectrum: While supporters celebrated the Queen as a symbol of continuity and unity, others critiqued her role in upholding traditional societal structures, imperial power, and the legacies of exploitation.</p><p>The British Empire, which reached its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries, spanned smaller regions within Europe as well as vast territories in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The monarchy’s role in this vast empire cannot be separated from the economic exploitation, cultural erasure, and political subjugation that many colonised peoples experienced. Yet, Queen Elizabeth II herself, as head of the Commonwealth established when most colonies gained independence, has also been seen as a figurehead in postcolonial discussions about equality and collaboration in the later 20th century.</p><p>It is interesting to find out how the international Twittersphere reacted to the jubilee celebrations and what (post)colonial themes were mentioned online. Scraping the hashtags #Queen, #AbolishMonarchy, and #DecolonizeBritain at the time of the jubilee celebrations reflected polarised sentiments. Because the data was collected based on rather generic hashtags and dates, not geographic location or more specific keywords, it includes both pro-monarchy statements and critiques that stem from various sources. Anti-monarchists sentiments can include reasons unrelated to colonial history, such as concerns about the high expenses of the royal family or scandals surrounding the Queen&#39;s children.</p><p>It will be your task to dive deeper into this data using Voyant Tools to see if more specific postcolonial themes can be uncovered. You will need to look beyond some of the more obvious terms and search for subtler forms of discourse about the monarchy&#39;s role in postcolonial contexts, paying attention to mentions of race, national identity, or the monarchy&#39;s present-day connection to authoritarian regimes abroad.</p><p><strong>Data Sets (collected via the Twitter API)</strong></p><p>The following data sets can be used for analysis:</p><ul><li>Tweets with hashtags such as #queen, #jubilee2022, #abolishmonarchy, and #decolonizebritain.</li><li>Data files are available as both CSV (searchable directly on GitHub) and TXT formats for distant reading.</li></ul><p><strong>Questions for Data Analysis</strong></p><p>Here are some research questions to explore through Voyant Tools, which will help uncover key themes and sentiments in the data:</p><ol><li><p><strong>What is the emotional tone of the tweets about the Queen’s Jubilee?</strong></p><p>Are people’s reactions to the jubilee generally positive, negative, or mixed? Use sentiment analysis tools in Voyant to identify emotional trends and key phrases linked to different sentiments (e.g., &quot;love,&quot; &quot;pride,&quot; &quot;anger,&quot; &quot;resentment&quot;).</p></li><li><p><strong>What is the relationship between colonialism and the monarchy in these conversations?</strong></p><p>How do tweets link the monarchy to historical colonial power? Which regions or countries discuss colonialism most frequently? Use Voyant&#39;s &quot;co-occurrence&quot; tools (e.g. Links and Terms Berry) to analyse which terms often appear alongside “empire” or “colonial.”</p></li><li><p><strong>How do users from former colonies engage with the monarchy compared to users in the UK?</strong></p><p>Is there a difference in how people from the Global South and those from the UK view the monarchy? Compare the frequency of critical versus celebratory tweets, as well as the use of terms like “reparations,” “independence,” and “sovereignty.”</p></li><li><p><strong>Is there a connection between #abolishmonarchy and demands for decolonisation?</strong></p><p>Are demands for abolishing the monarchy mostly associated with particular critiques of the colonial past or neocolonial trends today?</p></li><li><p><strong>What role does the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee play in postcolonial identity?</strong></p><p>How do people frame the jubilee in terms of identity and national consciousness? Are there references to modern-day struggles for independence, such as debates over reparations or royal apologies?</p></li></ol><p><strong>Idea for Further Data Analysis: The Legacy of the Monarchy in Popular Media</strong></p><p>Beyond social media, it could be valuable to explore how popular media narratives, such as documentaries, dramatised films, and books, shape postcolonial discourses about the monarchy. For example, the ITV documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jj90yqcyb9k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Queen’s Green Planet</a> offers a positive view of the monarchy’s role in environmentalism and diplomacy that may hide more controversial aspects. By contrast, the Netflix series <em>The Crown</em> presents royal history as a soap opera with a focus on family entanglements and personal tragedies.<br> Exploring how viewers react to such narratives, e.g. in YouTube comments, can be an interesting topic to explore in a final essay.</p><p><strong>Cited Works and Further Readings:</strong></p><ul><li>Hall, C.
