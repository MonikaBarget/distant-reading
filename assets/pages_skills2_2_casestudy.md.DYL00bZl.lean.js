For beginners, a focus on a limited amount of tools, starting with a simple frequency analysis, is recommended. The steps below can easily be applied to different data sets and offer insights that ideally inspire critical close reading.</p><h3 id="high-level-analysis-with-word-cloud-and-frequencies-table" tabindex="-1"><strong>High-level analysis with word cloud and frequencies table</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#high-level-analysis-with-word-cloud-and-frequencies-table" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**High-level analysis with word cloud and frequencies table**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Look at the word cloud and the corresponding frequencies table. What words are the most prominent? What different topics or themes can you identify in the data?</li><li>Who are the &quot;protagonists&quot; mentioned in the data? Are any people mentioned by name, and who are they? Show hosts, politicians, police officers?</li><li>What places (e.g. cities) are mentioned in the data? Why do you think that could be the case?</li><li>What surprises you?

Put them into the trends tool. How did these emotions develop over time?</li><li>Try to find groups of words for comparative analysis in &quot;trends&quot;. This group of words should be homogeneous in terms of word type or theme. You can, for example, look at different place names or trace the distribution of different adjectives (e.g. &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;exciting&quot;, &quot;boring&quot;). It does not make sense to randomly combine terms from different word groups.</li></ul><h3 id="analysing-co-occurrences-correlations-with-the-links-tool-or-the-correlations-tool" tabindex="-1"><strong>Analysing co-occurrences/correlations with the &quot;links&quot; tool or the &quot;correlations&quot; tool</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#analysing-co-occurrences-correlations-with-the-links-tool-or-the-correlations-tool" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Analysing co-occurrences/correlations with the &quot;links&quot; tool or the &quot;correlations&quot; tool**&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>What words are most prominently associated with the words &quot;police&quot; and &quot;cop&quot;?
