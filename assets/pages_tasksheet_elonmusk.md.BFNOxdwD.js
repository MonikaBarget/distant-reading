The event marked a turning point in discussions about digital governance, online freedom of speech, and the role of powerful tech entrepreneurs in shaping public discourse.</p><p>The dataset we collected in October 2022 was not only controversial in terms of content but also difficult to analyse because of a high amount of advertising and spam, including bot posts. Soon after, we had to stop using Twitter / X data for teaching when academic API access was stopped.</p><p>Nevertheless, Elon Musk&#39;s activities in business and politics remain an interesting case for media studies scholars. Musk&#39;s shifting conflicts and collaborations with figures like Donald Trump and his recent statements about founding a new political party in the US make him a key example for examining the democratic implications of platform power.</p><h2 id="exploring-youtube-comments" tabindex="-1">Exploring YouTube comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#exploring-youtube-comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Exploring YouTube comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To extend this discussion, students may now analyse YouTube comments.
