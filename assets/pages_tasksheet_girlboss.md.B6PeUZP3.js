The movement was a celebration of female empowerment in the corporate world, especially on social media. Under the hashtag #GirlBoss and similar slogans such as #SheLeads, women posted about their entrepreneurial efforts and their ambitions to succeed in male-dominated industries, often combining feminist rhetoric with business jargon and personal branding (Freeman, 2014).</p><p>Despite its initial popularity, the movement has faced backlash, especially when key figures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Amoruso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sophia Amoruso</a> were criticised for harsh treatment of employees and creating cultures of intimidation around them (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.-a). Moreover, several start-ups created by &quot;girl bosses&quot; at the time ran into financial difficulties. Examples are Sophia Amoruso&#39;s fashion business <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasty_Gal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Nasty Gal</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wing_(workspace)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Wing</em></a>, a women-focused social club and co-working space (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.-b; Wikipedia contributors, n.d.-c). Critics have since argued that the &quot;girl boss&quot; image promotes a superficial, materialistic and exclusionary version of feminism whose focus on individual success betrays feminist solidarity and the fight for system change. The term has also been criticized for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;commodifying feminism&quot;</a> and ignoring gender inequality as well as challenges of intersectionality (Petersson McIntyre, 2021).</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-care-girlboss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leigh Stein&#39;s (2020) satirical novel <em>Self Care</em></a>, based on the writer&#39;s own experiences as the co-founder of an online community for women during the 2010s, demonstrates through fiction how the #girlboss narrative can lead to self-exploitation and the exploitation of others (Knibbs, 2020). Similarly, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/girlbosses-what-comes-next/613519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an article in The Atlantic, published in 2020,</a> critically analysed the movement&#39;s rhetoric (Mull, 2020). In July 2020, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-girl-boss-analysis-2020-7#:~:text=June%202020%20was%20the%20month,a%20second%20time%20in%20July" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Business Insider</a> welcomed the fall of the #girlboss phenomenon, arguing that its decline is beneficial for promoting more sustainable and inclusive forms of feminism in the workplace (Hoffower, 2020). <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2022/06/28/why-female-entrepreneurs-welcome-the-end-of-the-girlboss-era-once-and-for-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Forbes</a>, in June 2022, also claimed that &quot;female entrepreneurs welcome the end of the girlboss era - once and for all&quot; (McGrath &amp; Sternlicht, 2022).</p><p>However, it is not entirely clear what exactly the post-#girlboss business woman should look like. The Dutch <a href="https://www.elle.com/nl/carriere-en-geld/a40830883/girlboss-sabbatical-minder-werken-tijdperk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ELLE</a> wondered in July 2022 what might come next, now that the #girlboss is (at least officially) dead, but could not provide a clear answer (Urwin, 2022). After all, the Covid pandemic seems to have led to a certain revival of the &quot;career queen&quot; ethos. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/01/decline-girlboss-culture-career-queen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett&#39;s (2022) piece in The Guardian</a> claims that the &quot;girlboss culture&quot; is, post-pandemic, &quot;more ubiquitous than ever.&quot;</p><h3 id="debating-the-girlboss-phenomenon-on-youtube-and-in-podcasts" tabindex="-1">Debating the girlboss phenomenon on YouTube and in podcasts <a class="header-anchor" href="#debating-the-girlboss-phenomenon-on-youtube-and-in-podcasts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Debating the girlboss phenomenon on YouTube and in podcasts&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Datasets that can give us an insight into how different social groups discuss the girlboss phenomenon and the role of female entrepreneurs more generally are reactions to relevant YouTube videos.

Reviews to these podcasts can also be an interesting data set. To give you a starting point for your data exploration in Voyant, I have already scraped the YouTube playlist comments as well as a small set of <a href="https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/Data_AppStore_Girlboss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reviews for some relevant podcasts</a> that you can explore as one data set or in comparison (with YouTube comments). Many other podcasts also cover female leadership in a single episode, but filtering reviews on just that topic from a larger pool of themes can be difficult.</p><h3 id="questions-for-data-analysis" tabindex="-1">Questions for data analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#questions-for-data-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Questions for data analysis&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Here are some questions that you could explore based on YouTube comments left under videos and talks discussing the girlboss movement and female entrepreneurship:</p><ul><li>What emotions do commenters express regarding the girlboss movement? Which adjectives and phrases are frequently used to describe female entrepreneurs?</li><li>How do viewers evaluate empowerment and agency among women in entrepreneurship? Is there a dominant view or significant division?</li><li>What themes related to gender, race, or socioeconomic status emerge from the comments?</li><li>In what ways do the comments reveal past or present stereotypes about women in leadership roles?</li><li>Do the YouTube comments contribute to more awareness of the challenges faced by women in the business world? Can the comments contribute to a positive change?</li></ul><p>In Voyant Tools, consider employing a variety of tools to address these questions.
