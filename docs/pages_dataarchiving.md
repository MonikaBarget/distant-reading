### 1) Social Media as Key Data for Modern Sociological Research

Social media platforms are indispensable sources of data for contemporary research across the humanities, social sciences, computer science, and natural sciences. They not only serve as objects of study but also as dynamic archives reflecting societal trends, cultural shifts, and digital communication patterns. For example, Twitter (now X) has been a rich resource for analyzing public opinion, social movements, and linguistic evolution. Until early 2023, its accessible API and extensive data archives enabled a surge in research projects, allowing scholars to build large corpora and conduct longitudinal studies. However, the platform’s recent monetization and restructuring have significantly restricted access, underscoring the fragility of relying on commercial platforms for academic research and the urgent need for sustainable archiving solutions.

### 2) Challenges for Research Reproducibility as a Side Effect of Archiving Challenges

The archiving of social media data faces technical, economic, social, and legal hurdles, which directly impact research reproducibility. When platforms like Twitter limit or monetize access to historical data, researchers lose the ability to verify or replicate studies based on those datasets. This creates a “data gap,” where findings become irreproducible if the original data is no longer available or is altered. Additionally, the dynamic nature of social media—such as deleted posts, evolving platform features, and changing user behaviors—further complicates long-term data preservation. These challenges highlight the need for collaborative efforts among researchers, libraries, and archives to develop standardized methods for capturing, storing, and sharing social media data in ways that ensure its usability for future research.

### 3) Initiatives for the Sustainable Archiving of Social Media Data

The German-speaking Twitter Tagung is an annual event hosted by the German National Library and focussing on challenges of making social media data available for research in the long term.
In 2024, the event emphasized the importance of cross-disciplinary and institutional collaboration to address the archiving crisis. Several initiatives and concepts were discussed:
- **Collaborative Networks:** Projects like **NFDI4Culture**, **Text+**, and **BERD@NFDI** are working to create infrastructures for archiving and providing access to social media data, focusing on metadata standardization and interoperability.
- **Data Registries:** Proposals for a **Social Media Data Registry** aim to centralize information about existing datasets, making it easier for researchers to locate and reuse archived material.
- **Ethical and Legal Frameworks:** Discussions addressed the ethical implications of archiving personal data and the legal constraints (e.g., copyright, GDPR) that must be navigated to ensure responsible data stewardship.
- **Derivative Data Products:** Initiatives are exploring ways to provide aggregated or anonymized datasets, which can mitigate privacy concerns while still enabling meaningful analysis.

The conference also included a **datasprint** to work with a long-term corpus of German Twitter data, fostering hands-on engagement with archiving challenges and solutions.
