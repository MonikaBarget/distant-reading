# Distant reading case study "race and diversity"

## Why race and diversity matter in social sciences

Race and diversity are central themes in the social sciences because they shape individuals' experiences and (professional) opportunities. Understanding how race interacts with other social factors, such as gender, class, and nationality, is crucial for addressing inequality and promoting social justice.
As the publishers summarised Michael Root's (2007) chapter [Race in the social sciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444515421500234) for *Philosophy of Anthropology and Sociology, a volume in Handbook of the Philosophy of Science*:

> Social scientists have a reason to use race as a descriptive or analytic category in their studies of individual differences in a social or economic trait even if they disapprove of racial classification or dream of a day when people are not classified by race or when a person's race makes no difference to her social or economic status (Elsevier, 2007).

Social sciences research focussing on race and related aspects can, ideally, help us overcome persisting discriminations against certain groups and contribute to more inclusive public and private institutions.
