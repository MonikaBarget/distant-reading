# Distant reading case study "race and diversity"

## Why race and diversity matter in social sciences

Race and diversity are central themes in the social sciences because they shape individuals' experiences and (professional) opportunities.
Understanding how race interacts with other social factors, such as gender, class, and nationality, is crucial for addressing inequality and promoting social justice.
Social sciences research focussing on race and related aspects can also help us overcome persisting discriminations against certain groups and contribute to more inclusive public and private institutions.
