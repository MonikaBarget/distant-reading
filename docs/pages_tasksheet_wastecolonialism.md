# Distant reading case study "waste colonialism"

:book: I use this case study in my postcolonialism lecture to showcase a postcolonial reading of a contemporary data set.

## Waste management and waste reduction as global issues

The term [waste colonialism](https://stopwastecolonialism.org/) is used by researchers, activists and NGOs. It refers to the practice of affluent nations exporting their waste, including plastics, e-waste or used fashion, to poorer countries. This practice, critics argue, disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations and ecosystems. As developed nations reduce waste in their own countries, also to meet environmental goals in the face of climate change, they often ship their garbage to the Global South, which gives the problem a (post)colonial dimension.

## Case Study: Waste Impact in the Pacific Islands

One data set that can give us an insight how different user communities online discuss the issue of waste exports to the Global South can be the comments left under videos on the [Stop Waste Colonialism YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9MlUgj6K-_ihjD1IlNvjS4uKI6Q--xjP) curated by the Or Foundation. This group is dedicated to choice and agency for all communities. It intends to help disadvantaged groups and regions "escape the predominant violent socio-economic system of corporate colonialism and to change it from within." In this effort, the vision of the Or Foundation aligns with many other groups fighting global waste problems, e.g. in the Pacific Ocean, and NGOs that track the journeys of waste from country to country.

## Questions for Data Analysis

In a data analysis with Voyant Tools, we can try and answer the following questions:

- What patterns do we see in global flows of plastic waste, textile waste, and e-waste?
- How do different YouTube users from different countries and social backgrounds respond to the environmental impact of these waste exports?
- What opportunities for change are discussed in the data set? Who is pushing for change and why?
