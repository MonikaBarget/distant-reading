# Sampla analyses

## Analyses of smaller data sets

The [Sample analyses](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/sample_analyses) folder contains slides / presentations with interpretations of the datasets shared here. Most of the presentations were created by students of Digital Cultures at the University of Maastricht and were (anonymously) shared with their permission.

## BA and MA projects with a distant reading component

The following repositories contain data and visualisations (mostly created with Voyant) from BA and MA theses written at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS) in Maastricht:

- [Querdenker communication on Twitter](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/BA_DS_Querdenker)

This repository contains data sets and visualisations relating to the social media communication of the German "Querdenker" movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected and analysed for the BA thesis in "Digital Society", submitted by Deborah Helmich at Maastricht University in 2022. The visualisations are based on distant reading with Voyant Tools. Data tables in EXCEL format need to be downloaded before viewing. CSV files can be opened and viewed directly on GitHub.

- [Diversity in higher education](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/MA-DC_diversity-in-higher-education)

This repository contains data tables and charts created for the MA thesis written by Xing Yin (@sachixing) in 2022. The thesis covers diversity policies in higher education worldwide and places a special emphasis on internationalisation, ethnic diversity and de-colonization. All selected policy papers have been analysed with Voyant Tools. All the charts published here have been exported from Voyant. This thesis was submitted in the MA degree programme Digital Cultures at Maastricht University.

- [Political parties in the UK and digitalization](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/MA_DC_parties-and-digitalization)

Data tables and charts created for the MA thesis written by Yin Nien Chiang in 2022. The thesis covers digitalization policies in party manifetos issued by parties of the political left in the United Kingdom. The party manifestos have been analysed with Voyant Tools. All the charts published here have been exported from Voyant. This thesis was submitted in the MA degree programme Digital Cultures at Maastricht University.

- [True Crime Podcast](https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ma-dc-student-projects/ma-dc-true-crime-podcasts)

This repository contains data and code created for Nicole Schanzmeyer's MA DC thesis project on True Crime Podcasts and their public perception in the academic year of 2022/2023. This is a repository on the UM Gitlab instance and only visible to members of Maastricht University.

## Full theses with a focus on distant reading

Over time, full theses with a focus on distant reading may also become available in the [UM Theses Database](https://studenttheses.library.maastrichtuniversity.nl/) as more students share their work after graduation. Please note that access is only possible when you are logged in to the UM network.
