You can, for instance, use the <em>Remove Duplicates</em> feature (found under the Data tab) to delete any duplicate entries. You can use functions like UPPER(), LOWER(), or PROPER() to standardise text formats. Similarly, EXCEL has a TRIM() function to remove extra spaces before or after text entries. EXCEL also permits filtering and conditional formatting to highlight special features. Last but not least, EXCEL can be used to create simple charts (such as bar graphs) to visualise data.
