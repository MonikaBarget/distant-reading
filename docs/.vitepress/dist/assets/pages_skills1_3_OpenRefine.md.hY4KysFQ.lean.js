You can use Open Refine directly in the UM DSRI or install it on your local machines.<br> In our course, Open Refine helps us filter podcast reviews to create sub-collections of data for analysis in Voyant Tools.</p><h2 id="using-filters-in-open-refine" tabindex="-1">Using filters in Open Refine <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-filters-in-open-refine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using filters in Open Refine&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can filter the data displayed in OpenRefine by applying a ‘Text Filter’, which looks for a particular piece of text appearing in a column. Text filters are applied by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the column you want to apply the filter to and choosing <strong>Text filter</strong>. The filter options appear in the left-hand panel. Simply type in the text you want to use in the Filter to display only rows which contain that text in the relevant column. You can also use <a href="https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-data-intro/04-regular-expressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">regular expressions</a> in the filter.</p><p>It is very important to note that when you have filtered the data displayed in OpenRefine, any operations you carry out will apply only to the rows that match the filter – that is, the data currently being displayed. This also means that only the current selection will be saved when you export your data while a filter is active!</p><p><strong>Screenshot 1</strong>: applying a text filter to the reviews column to find all reviews mentioning &quot;victims&quot;<br><img src="'+i+'" alt="Screenshot 1"></p><h2 id="working-with-facets-in-open-refine" tabindex="-1">Working with facets in Open Refine <a class="header-anchor" href="#working-with-facets-in-open-refine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Working with facets in Open Refine&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Facets are one of the most useful features of OpenRefine and can help both get an overview of the data in a project as well as helping you bring more consistency to the data. A ‘Facet’ groups all the values that appear in a column, and then allows you to filter the data by these values and edit values across many records at the same time. The simplest type of Facet is called a ‘Text facet’. This simply groups all the text values in a column and lists each value with the number of records it appears in. The facet information always appears in the left-hand panel in the OpenRefine interface.</p><p>To create a Text Facet for a column, click on the drop-down menu at the top of the publisher column and choose <code>Facet -&gt; Text Facet</code>. The facet will then appear in the left-hand panel. The facet consists of a list of values used in the data. You can filter the data displayed by clicking on one of these headings. You can include multiple values from the facet in a filter at one time by using the <code>Include</code> option, which appears when you put your mouse over a value in the Facet. You can also <code>invert</code> the filter to show all records which do not match your selected values. This option appears at the top of the Facet panel when you select a value from the facet to apply as a filter.</p><p>Facets can be a great way to select podcast reviews by user names, time periods, or star ratings.</p><p><strong>Screenshot 2</strong>: facet applied to &quot;user&quot; column, showing all user names and the number of reviews written<br> ![Screenshot 2](../screenshots_distant_reading/OpenRefine_text facet.png)</p><p>Please also read the documentation for &quot;Exporting your Work&quot; in the official <a href="https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/exporting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open Refine</a> documentation!</p><p><strong>Screenshot 3</strong>: using the &quot;export&quot; option to save a data selection in a new file<br><img src="'+s+'" alt="Screenshot 3"></p><p><strong>Screenshot 4</strong>: raw text from &quot;reviews&quot; column copied into a .txt file<br> ![Screenshot 4](../screenshots_distant_reading/OpenRefine_save raw text.png)</p>',14)]))}const m=t(r,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,m as default};
