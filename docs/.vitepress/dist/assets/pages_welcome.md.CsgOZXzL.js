Thanks to generous financial and logistical support by the digital studies lab <a href="https://theplant.maastrichtuniversity.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Plant</a>, I was able to create the current website in 2024.</p><p>This repository contains teaching materials catered to the technical skills of humanities and social sciences students, but researchers without previous programming experience may also find them helpful to explore the possibilities of <em>distant reading</em> for their work. The term &quot;distant reading&quot; (Franco Moretti) is often used to describe computator-assisted and often statistical text analysis as opposed to human-performed <em>close reading</em>. A basis of distant reading is machine-readable text, which is why this repository also provides materials on (automated) data collection for academic purposes. The focus is on natively digital text in the form of social media posts, comments and reviews, but distant reading can also be applied to retro-digitised materials.</p><h2 id="credits-and-updates" tabindex="-1">Credits and updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#credits-and-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Credits and updates&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I have developed the resources shared here in close collaboration with my students and several colleagues / co-teachers. Arnoud Wils (The Plant, FASoS) has kindly reviewed my code and provided instructions for using infrastructures specific to Maastricht University. Susan Schreibman (Professor of Digital Arts and Culture, FASoS) and some of my MA students have inspired case studies and are credited in the relevant sections. More case studies and tutorials will be added over time, and some sections are clearly work in progress. Please also be aware that code can quickly deprecate. If you have any questions or would like to flag missing / outdated information, please use the issue section in the code repository to inform me.</p><h2 id="readings-on-zotero" tabindex="-1">Readings on Zotero <a class="header-anchor" href="#readings-on-zotero" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Readings on Zotero&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For additional readings on text analysis and the tools recommended in this repository, you can consult the relevant folders in my public <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/4457227/fasos_-_digital_society__digital_cultures/collections/YAGEDFPB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Digital Society and Digital Cultures Zotero group library</a>.</p><h2 id="contact" tabindex="-1">Contact <a class="header-anchor" href="#contact" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contact&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you have questions or would like to collaborate, please reach out!
