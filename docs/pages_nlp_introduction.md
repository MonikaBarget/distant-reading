# Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## What is NLP and who uses it?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) encompasses the computational analysis and generation of human-readable language (as opposed to machine language).
Hodeghatta and Nayak (2023) show that NLP is not only of interest to linguists or literary scholars but also applied outside academia, e.g. in the field of Business Intelligence.
In fact, NLP technologies are embedded in many text-oriented (web) applications that consumers use on a regular basis, such as online shops, chatbots, or news and weather apps.

## Why is it difficult?

<blockquote>Natural language processing (NPL) is an extremely difficult task in computer science. Languages present a wide variety of problems that vary from language to language. Structuring or extracting meaningful information from free text represents a great solution, if done in the right manner. Previously, computer scientists broke a language into its grammatical forms, such as parts of speech, phrases, etc., using complex algorithms.
Today, deep learning is a key to performing the same exercises.</blockquote> (Goyal et. al., 2018, abstract)

## What role does text analysis play in NLP?

Text analysis as we perform it in "Machines of Knowledge" is just one element of NLP. NLP also includes text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, the generation of texts through language models, and translations between languages.
Hodeghatta and Nayak outline the broad range of NLP applications in their book.

## What tools are used for NLP in research?

NLP can be performed with ready-made tools like Voyant or the Dariah Topics Explorer, but their functionality is naturally limited and users can only manipulate the underlying algorithms to a small degree.
Working with programming languages such as Python or R offers more flexibility. Commonly used NLP packages that integrate with Python and R are [spacy], [NLTK] etc.
Janco et al. (2019) explain the use of spaCy specifically for digital humanities research.
