### Teaching text analysis with Twitter data in 2021 and 2022

In 2021 and 2022, the coordinators of the Machines of Knowledge course taught computational text analysis with Twitter data because the Twitter API allowed allowed user-friendly access to a large amount of social media data on current topics. Among the topics that we explore in class in winter 2022 were the attack on a gay bar in Oslo, ethical debates around the FIFA Worldcup in Qatar, and Elon Musk's contested acquisition of Twitter:

- [Twitter reactions to the 2022 FIFA Worldcup in Qatar (ca. 100000 tweets)](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/Twitter_WorldCupQatar2022)
- [Twitter reactions to Elon Musk's takeover of the platform between October 28 and October 31](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/Twitter_ElonMusk2022)

Working with these data sets while full academic API access was still possible revealed increasing flaws of Twitter data that made us question whether this type of data was at all suitable for teaching and student research. Among the observations that we made with our students were the high amount of spam and bot posts piggy-backing on every trending hashtag, the many cryptocurrency and NFT advertisements distorting our data, and the problematic tone and quality of many contributions.

### Exploring alternative data sources after 2023

In 2022, the take-over of Twitter by Elon Musk resulted in fundamental changes of the platform's academic and educational policy, which forced us to explore new data sources in the 2023/2024 academic year.

- [App Store comments about successful true crime podcasts](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/Data_AppStore_TrueCrime)
- [YouTube reactions to Judith Butler's video lecture on intersectionality (ca. 2000 comments)](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/YouTube_JudithButler)
- [YouTube comments on Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem (ca. 8000 comments)](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/distant-reading/tree/main/data/YouTube_AmandaGorman)

### Case studies for teaching since 2024

Since 2024, Monika Barget has integrated data stilled used for teaching the MA Digital Cultures course Machines of Knowledge at Maastricht University into more elaborate case studies that also offer students historical and cultural background information. These case studies, which include recommendations for different data sources per topic, are regularly updated in Github:
