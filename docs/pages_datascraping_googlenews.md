# Scraping news items via the Google API

## Use cases and limitations

When working on contemporary political and social issues, getting "treding" news via the Google API can be one solution for a relatively fast data collection. Unfortunately, the way in which Google News entries are ranked is not entirely transparent. The [Google Publisher Help Center](https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/9606702?hl=en) states that "ranking in Google News is determined algorithmically" and mentions "relevance of content", "prominence", "authoritativeness", "freshness", "location" and "language" as the most important factors. However, criteria such as "freshness" are not specified and scraping of news items shows that many articles are ranked highly for several days in a row. This is why working with Google News always requires a critical reflection on the data retrieved.

## Overview of available Google News API scraper on Github

Github has a helpful [overview of code and apps](https://github.com/topics/google-news-scraper) that can be used to scrape Google News. Most of these respositories provide information on scraping metadata, but not the actual text behind the articles (see information below). A considerable number of the scripts for extracting news via the Google API are written in Python, a programming language that is very popular in the digital humanities and social sciences. What you have to keep in mind is that most of the scripts are written by developers who are not paid for maintenance and who may therefore abandon the scripts after a while. API changes on the side of Google can then result in depricated code.
 
## options to scrape content by time or region

Several forum discussions, e.g. on Stackoverflow, cover the different scraping options for Google News and the challenges they may pose. The parameters that the Google News API allows for data selection are documented [here](https://serpapi.com/google-news-api). One problem is that Google News now only permit a collection of 100 items max. per query, and it is unfortunately not possible to scrape news by the hour (see [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73072802/web-scraping-articles-from-google-news) on Stackoverflow and the relevant responses. The smallest time frame that can be selected is one day. But collecting news across a longer time frame is still possible when looping through a longer period of time. It can also help to combine scraping data per day with scraping data per country as the default setting in Google news is to collect US news.

To scrape Google news by country, you can iterate through the list of countries in which Google services are supported. The full list of countries is available for download here: [https://serpapi.com/google-countries](https://serpapi.com/google-countries)

However, in many cases, all countries across the world are shown the exact same news items, especially where international crises are concerned. Testing data scraping for an MA thesis, the student found that Afghanisatan and Australia, for instance, were shown the exact same top-60 news items for the keyword "Gaza" on October 7, 2023, to October 8, 2023, shortly after the conflict between Israel and Palestine escalated:

## running code on Colab

Easy to reuse code that runs well on Google Colab if you register for your own Google API: 

https://github.com/topics/google-news-scraper

## adjusting code for other environments (Jupyterlab)

To run the code in other environments, e.g Jupyterlab, you need to change the first few lines of code relating to Google Colab settings. On the Maastricht University DSRI, you need to import the relevant packages via <code>!pip install</code>, and it may also be necessary to define a specific output directory. 

More detailed documentation will follow...

## Extracting text for distant reading

The Google News scraping gives us a JSON file with basic metadata, such as news outlet, date, and URL. However, it does not automatically give us the text content of the articles behind the news. There are several options to proceed:

### Exporting HTML pages to PDF

1) use a second script to harvest the HTML files behind the URLs with the <code>selenium</code> package for web crawling, then download the HTML files and batch-convert them to PDF as many distant reading tools such as Voyant process PDF input
2) for converting HTML to PDF, Python scripts can also be used but not all packages run smoothly on the UM DSRI (Monika is still working on solutions)
3) PDF documents can also be batch-converted with PDF editors such as [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/hub/how-to-batch-convert-to-pdf.html), including browser-based tools such as [PrintFriendly](https://www.printfriendly.com/)

- this script has an option to scrape <code>article.text()</code> to CSV: https://github.com/pratikpv/google_news_scraper_and_sentiment_analyzer/blob/master/google_news_scraper.py

 ### Extracting full text from news URLs

Newspaper3k is a Python package for article scraping and curation. Compatible with Python3, it leverages lxml and it extracts articles from diverse web sources. Its GitHub integration facilitates collaboration but a deprecated Python2 branch exists.

Installation information: https://pypi.org/project/newspaper3k/
Newspaper3k can be also be installed on the UM DSRI.
