# Data scraping with the Google API

## Why you might need a Google API key

The Google API key can give you access to several interesting data sources such as YouTube videos and comments. Using your own API key, especially when you want to scrape a lot of data for your thesis,
is recommended as the key provided by your teacher may expire or come with rate limits.

## How you can sign up for your own Google API key

First, you need to log in to the Google Developers Console. There you can create a new project. On the new project dashboard, click **Explore & Enable APIs**.
You will now see a search option to specify which Google service you want to use. If you are interested in getting access to YouTube, type "YouTube" in the search box
and then navigate to **YouTube Data API v3** listed under YouTube APIs. Enable the API and select the option to create a new credential. A screen will appear with your new API key.
