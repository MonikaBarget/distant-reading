## Slavery as an important theme in media studies

Slavery is an important theme in postcolonial studies but also societally relevant. As James W. Loewen wrote in 2017, "we are a product of our history — even the history we don’t like to think about." (Adapted excerpt from the first chapter of *Understanding and Teaching American Slavery*, published in [Learning for Justice, Issue 55, Spring 2017](https://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/spring-2017/what-learning-about-slavery-can-teach-us-about-ourselves)) And slavery is undoubtedly a global phenomenon that shaped the cultures and economic fortunes of many present-day countries. One lasting challenge that cannot be detached from slavery is racism. Loewen reminds us in his article:

> In the United States, as a legal and social system, slavery ended between 1863 and 1865, depending upon where one lived. Unfortunately, racism, slavery’s handmaiden, did > not. In turn, white supremacy, the ideology that slavery begot, caused the Democratic Party to label itself the “white man’s party” for almost a century, into the 1920s. > Also during the 1920s, white supremacy led to the “science” of eugenics (human breeding), IQ and SAT testing, and restrictions on the immigration of “inferior races” from > southern and eastern Europe as well as Asia and Africa.

For media studies students, working with slavery-related data from the past can, therefore, be a way to better understand ongoing legacies of colonial power and (problematic) media portrayals of different ethnic and social groups today. It is also important to remember that slave trade and slavery were sustained by many agents, including people from countries which we would consider small and of lesser influence today. One example is the Dutch involvement in the slave trade, which can be overlooked when the focus is on the English-speaking world. According to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's [Slavery and Remembrance](https://slaveryandremembrance.org/articles/article/?id=A0145) website, "the Dutch transported about half a million Africans across the Atlantic" between 1596 and 1829. Moreoever, they shipped "about a half million Africans to their settlements in Dutch Guiana, notably Suriname, where they worked primarily on sugar plantations."

## Data sets related to slavery and its legacies

The broader topic of slavery offers many opportunities for data analysis, either based on historical records or based on modern perceptions and debates. On the internet, you will find several projects dedicated to making records from the colonial period accessible. Here is a list of resources worth consulting:

- The project [Enslaved - Peoples of the Historical Slave trade](https://enslaved.org/data/) links to data collections in several languages and with different foci.
- The [SlaveVoyages](https://www.slavevoyages.org/) website is a collaborative digital initiative that contains records of the largest slave trades in history. The data include details like ship names, departure ports, and demographic data of enslaved individuals. While this data is primarily quantitative, accompanying documents can be used for computational text analysis.
- The collection [Documenting the American South](https://docsouth.unc.edu/) includes full-text narratives from formerly enslaved people, slave traders, and abolitionists although this is not the collection's only focus.
- [Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936–1938 (Library of Congress)](https://www.loc.gov/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/) assembles firsthand accounts from formerly enslaved individuals.
- The archival collection [British Online Archives: Slavery, Abolition, and Social Justice](https://www.britishonlinearchives.digital/) contains documents on the transatlantic slave trade, abolitionist efforts, and economic records of slavery. These documents consist in parliamentary papers, slave compensation records, and personal letters, which especially shed light on Britain’s role.
- The project [Dutch Atlantic Connections (c.1680–1795)](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl/projecten/dutch-atlantic-connections-1680-1795/), hosted by the Huygens Institute, includes a database and transcriptions of Dutch archival records.
- Focused on British colonial administration, [Colonial Despatches (University of Victoria)](https://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/)** is a collection of government records that includes information on (slave) trade as well as the treatment of enslaved and indigenous people.
- The digital collection [African American Newspapers (Accessible Archives)](https://www.accessible-archives.com/) includes abolitionist newspapers from the 19th century.
