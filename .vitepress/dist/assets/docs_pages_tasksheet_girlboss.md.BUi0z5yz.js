The movement was a celebration of female empowerment in the corporate world, especially on social media. Under the hashtag #GirlBoss and similar slogans such as #SheLeads, women posted about their entrepreneurial efforts and their ambitions to succeed in male-dominated industries, often combining feminist rhetoric with business jargon and personal branding.</p><p>Despite its initial popularity, the movement has faced backlash, especially when key figures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Amoruso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sophia Amoruso</a> were criticised for harsh treatment of employees and creating cultures of intimidation around them. Moreover, several start-ups created by &quot;girl bosses&quot; at the time ran into financial difficulties. Examples are Sophia Amoruso&#39;s fashion business <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasty_Gal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Nasty Gal</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wing_(workspace)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>The Wing</em></a>, a women-focused social club and co-working space. Critics have since argued that the &quot;girl boss&quot; image promotes a superficial, materialistic and exclusionary version of feminism whose focus on individual success betrays feminist solidarity and the fight for system change. The term has also been criticized for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gwao.12627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;commodifying feminism&quot;</a> and ignoring gender inequality as well as challenges of intersectionality.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/self-care-girlboss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leigh Stein&#39;s satirical novel <em>Self Care</em></a>, based on the writer&#39;s own experiences as the co-founder of an online community for women during the 2010s, demonstrates through fiction how the #girlboss narrative can lead to self-exploitation and the exploitation of others. Similarly, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/girlbosses-what-comes-next/613519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">an article in The Atlantic, published in 2020,</a> critically analysed the movement&#39;s rhetoric. In July 2020, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/rise-and-fall-girl-boss-analysis-2020-7?international=true&amp;r=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Business Insider</a> welcomed the fall of the #girlboss phenomenon, arguing that its decline is beneficial for promoting more sustainable and inclusive forms of feminism in the workplace. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2022/06/28/why-female-entrepreneurs-welcome-the-end-of-the-girlboss-era-once-and-for-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Forbes</a>, in June 2022, also claimed that &quot;female entrepreneurs welcome the end of the girlboss era - once and for all&quot;.</p><p>However, it is not entirely clear what exactly the post-#girlboss business woman should look like. The Dutch <a href="https://www.elle.com/nl/carriere-en-geld/a40830883/girlboss-sabbatical-minder-werken-tijdperk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ELLE</a> wondered in July 2022 what might come next, now that the #girlboss is (at least officially) dead, but could not provide a clear answer. After all, the Covid pandemic seems to have led to a certain revival of the &quot;career queen&quot; ethos. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/01/decline-girlboss-culture-career-queen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett&#39;s piece in The Guardian, published in 2022</a> claims that the &quot;girlboss culture&quot; is, post-pandemic, &quot;more ubiquitous than ever.&quot;</p><h3 id="this-case-study-is-under-development-suggestions-for-the-voyant-analysis-cannot-be-published-at-present-because-a-student-in-the-ma-dc-programme-at-fasos-is-currently-working-on-a-similar-topic-for-their-thesis" tabindex="-1">This case study is under development.
