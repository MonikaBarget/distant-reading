The only daughter of a prominent Iranian family, at sixteen she is selected from among the most beautiful and eligible women of her country to wed the Shah of Iran. Too young to recognize prominent members of Iranian society made the match—and that her job is to help unite a country being driven apart—one truth is inescapable: Soraya loves the Shah deeply. Sadly, her affections are not equally returned, and her life is shattered overnight. The red carpet is pulled from under her feet as her royal status is torn away. Years later, a chance encounter with a distant relative leads Soraya back on a journey through the tender and tumultuous times of her life as another young woman struggles to come to terms with love and betrayal. Together, they share their stories of defeat and victories of love, hoping to make sense of the ever-fragile human heart.&quot;</p><h2 id="data-set-on-youtube" tabindex="-1">Data set on YouTube <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-set-on-youtube" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Data set on YouTube&quot;">​</a></h2><h2 id="suggestions-for-data-analysis" tabindex="-1">Suggestions for data analysis <a class="header-anchor" href="#suggestions-for-data-analysis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Suggestions for data analysis&quot;">​</a></h2>',11)]))}const p=a(s,[["render",n]]);export{f as __pageData,p as default};
