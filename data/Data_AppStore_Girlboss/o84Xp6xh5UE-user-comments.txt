"My issue with the female character's they've dished out recently isn't at all that they're female. It's that they're bad characters. I can and have named 50+ female Star Wars characters who are well-received by the fandom, some of whom are vastly more popular than their male counterparts. Look up a tier list of SWTOR companions, and almost every class will have female characters at the top of their respective lists. Vette, Ashara, Mako, Kira, Jaesa, Elara, Lana, and Senya are all fan-favorites and tend to be rated higher than the men. Furthermore, many women from the game who aren't companions or romantic options have whole forum posts detailing why they should be. Darth Acina, Rylee Dray, Thana Vesh, etc. 

But that's just videogames and nobody cares about videogame characters. Nerds hate the female movie characters. Right? Well... Leia has been beloved since 1977, and she stole the show from both male leads the moment they met her. Mon Mothma was the leader of the Rebellion (See: The Good Guys) since 1983 and I never heard any fans calling for her removal. Padme was introduced as the queen of a matriarchal garden world so prosperous that the Trade Federation chose it as the location of its blockade to force the Republic to concede on tariffs in the region, and she only became more influential and badass over time, yet it wasn't Natalie Portman who received enough undeserved vitriol online to ruin her career; it was Hayden. I'm not sure where Disney got the idea that nerds hate women, or at least that they could convince people of it, but it's easily the most absurd take I've seen or heard in decades. Nerds love women. Kind of a lot."	[]
Wait, what? Men like sci-fi, action, and war movies? Women like musicals and Romance movies? How do you know? I have never spoken to a human before and had no way of knowing this.	[]
They would try to make the NFL female and woke if they could .	[]
Why do studios think women would rather see a superhero movie about female superheroes than male superheroes?	[]
"we used to call these ""chick flicks"" but something changed in recent years where it's really pushing the viewpoint that women have to act like men and men have to enjoy it or they're pieces of sht. absolutely sick and tired of it. I like feminine women as well as people who aren't ego-driven turds with a chip on their shoulder. sue me."	[]

Do enough women watch action movies to merit catering to women? No, the answer is always no. Its the same reason the Hallmark Channel doesn't make Christmas movies for men because we already have Die Hard and that's enough.	[]

Who‚Äôs here after Kamala Harris lost the critical drinker is right. This is the death of the girl boss.	[]
I think what some people forget to realize. Is that the comic book industry even to this day is mostly male-dominated. So even back in the day the girl bosses were created and written by men. The comic book industry much like the movies is catered towards a male audience. In other words males writing for males and that's why it worked. When you take a male genre and then switch it up with female leads, directors, writers, so on and so forth it loses its poignancy and its audience. I know this sounds misogynistic and sexist. I'm not trying to be either. I'm simply stating a fact as I've come to understand it after years of comic book collecting and comic book movie watching. As the critical drinker stated, movies made by women for women do good just as most material written by women targeted towards women does really well. Of course you have your exceptions like JK Rowling's and Harry Potter for example. Something's crossover and does really well with both men and women. And for the record men aren't opposed to the girl boss I mean look at aliens and aliens with Sigourney Weaver. What we don't like is being told that we suck simply because we have a penis üòÖ	[]
It's almost like superheroes naturally appeal to masculine ideals and therefore male audiences.	[]

"I'm a woman and I hate romantic stuff. I live for Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Action movies. But I hate these new shit as much as you do. The women in these movies are not strong but ridiculous and pathetic. Shitting on men is so low and disgusting. I want good stories and believable chars. Men must be allowed to be men and women must be allowed to be women. They can not be the same and their strength is a different one. Neither is better! Movies like the original 2 Terminator, Star Wars or Alien understood this. Nowadays Hollywood seems to be unable to understand the simplest things.
I liked Maverick but hated Barbie."	[]
the girls that do go to those movies are nerds themselves and just want to see a good movie too	[]
Arya from GOT had a huge hero arc and failed over and over but emerged a powerful character in the end. Loved the struggle and journey of her character so much. Good writing vs scoring political points win every time.	[]

As a guy I went to the barbie movie with some friends when it came out. I didn't find everything in interesting but there was some funny stuff. I do agree with most of this. I like a lot more of the sci-fi/ medieval fantasy /Mecka series. There are people who find the opposite genres related to the demographics very interesting as a guy I am very into romance but I'm also a heavy action fan and I prefer romance more when it's blended as a subplot then a main plot. I also like protagonists from a male perspective more cause I'm a guy. I'm also sick of seeing the male protagonist that can't do anything or the male protagonist that starts off incompetent and learns how to do something it happens a lot on the male spectrum in books especially and it's quite annoying and overdone.	[]
no, u go away!	[]
even if it wasn't a movie or, technically, a superhero story... we have a great example of girlboss in the doctor who. having a female doctor was a great idea... that went as bad as it can go. that wasn't a failure. it was a disaster that almost destroyed the franchise.	[]
Just like the legacy media cannot longer be the gatekeepers to the truth, Hollywood is not anymore the shaper of social attitudes and mores. Their role has been dismantled by social media but they refuse to accept it. Watching them trying to hold on to that waning power is both pathetic and satisfying.	[]
By this logic Hollywood would make romantic movies geared towards men.	[]
why does hollywood struggle to write women?	[]

I'm a woman and my favorite genres are sci-fi and psychological horror. I can't image the writings of Philip K Dick or Kurt Vonnegut or William Gibson being changed to appeal specifically for women. They're already for everyone, it's just that men tend to appreciate them more.	[]

I hope you‚Äôll make more videos about this topic.	[]
I don't really care if the girl boss is gone, they destroyed multiple franchises which was their goal and they admitted that, I don't care what happens anymore, these writers won.	[]
"To be fair on the demographics thing, it's got a sort of, chicken and egg situation. Is the majority of an audience one sex because there's some deep, immovable difference. Or, is the majority of the audience that sex because that's historically who they are marketed for and pitched to. There's a feedback loop, in short, which runs the risk of creating staleness through data chasing when viewed by the risk averse higher ups. It's a part of the generation of the ""modern audience"", following data thoughtlessly"	[]

"women are going to complain there isn't more representatives in games,sports,action movies,

They just like complaining about it.

happily married 40 years and nothing's changed."	[]
One thing they still seem to miss is that even the 30% women that go to see Top Gun Maverick are either going with their husband and boyfriend and want him to have a good time, or are attracted to the action themselves.	[]
You waste your precious lives on nothing else than manmade fantasy nonsense. üòÇ. Experience the real. Be conscious.	[]
Never hire a writer that does not know the material very well. Even if you would try to make altercations, you need to preserve the core and feel. If you don't, you are better off writing something completely new.	[]

"You know what I don't get about the whole thing? So you're a studio, and you want to get female asses in seats. Why take something that doesn't appeal to them and bludgeon it into something that might? Why not just make something that appeals to them? Is there any reason Disney can't just make a good romance, or a good musical, or a good comedy, if they want to get female asses in seats? Is there really no reason they can't pull a Barbenheimer and release two movies, one for the guys and one for the girls? They might even secure some of that ""hey babe come with me to see x I don't want to go alone"" money."	[]
As a female, I don't give two sh*ts about having movies made by and starring females, I care about STORY.....Hollywood will never learn.....	[]
And we all learned we needed to love! Basic outcome of every Disney movie!	[]
"I loved action/adventure  superhero movies and I'm an actual woman. Although that was mostly in the 70s, 80s, and 90s(To be honest only the rare romance movie is any good any more for the same reason -massive disrespect to real women as well as men)
And lets face it the average good action movie is based on male traits and what the hell is wrong with that?
You can have a good action movie with woman. But it either has to be fantasy where a little woman in that world can fight like a man  or they have super powers that put them on the same level as men with superpowers or it has to be based on women's actual abilities."	[]
"I really love how the Avatar novels (the Kyoshi and Yangchen duologies) handle the concept of ‚ÄúOP women‚Äù. 

In the Kyoshi novels, Kyoshi has a lot of raw earthbending power but no precision. She can throw boulders all day but she can‚Äôt bend small rocks pretty much at all. This poses an issue for her in her very first scene, and later on she accidentally disintegrates a precious keepsake with her uncontrolled earthbending. There‚Äôs even a scene where someone close to her is killed, where it‚Äôs implied she could have prevented it if she had more precision over her bending.  Kyoshi is technically OP, and it‚Äôs impressive, but it comes at a huge emotional cost for her.

In the Yangchen novels, Yangchen is portrayed as a bending prodigy. We meet her when she‚Äôs about 16, and she‚Äôs already made a name for herself defeating powerful enemies with her bending. But in this case, Yangchen‚Äôs real enemies are politicians and greedy merchants, who she can‚Äôt just whack around with airbending. Yangchen can‚Äôt use her ‚ÄúOP-ness‚Äù to solve this problem because it would have huge political consequences for her. So she has to copy their strategy and become a sneaky, manipulative, politically savvy Avatar. She has to become what she hates for the good of the world. 

These books prove that you can make an ‚ÄúOP‚Äù female protagonist and still have it work, as long as you put her in situations where her overpoweredness will actively hinder her. It‚Äôs all about creativity and logical consistency."	[]
I could have liked the marvels. I sorta liked Captain marvel and Ms marvel. I feel like The Marvels is the best of the female only super movies.	[]
I wonder if they pursued an audience that didn‚Äôt exist or naively thought they could change the audience that did. Either way, it was a failure, but they did force everyone to evaluate their agenda. It is great that we rejected it, but did it have its effect on the mindless masses? I think to some extent it did‚Ä¶they simply accepted that the world is terrible, women are just men with breasts, and there are no stories worth telling anymore. Even as they superficially repent to save the bottom line they cannot return to the world that made a Lord of the Rings, Batman, or Alien. They have lost the ability to perform their function. It‚Äôs time to wipe the slate and replace these men without chests with those that have them.	[]
Anything that goes contrary to human nature is doomed to failure. Preferences between males and females as to what movies they like is a perfect example.	[]

Well, I would have gone to see all these movies if there had been more naked breasts and hot lesbian encounters.	['Especially interracial stuff.  Nothing like  a blonde haired white woman getting it on with a hot ebony chick.  Like in a 69.']
I really wonder what the girlboss trope does to young women. Are they capable of separating fiction from reality, or will we have to cope with squadrons of women who can't do anything wrong and expect the world to bow to their needs? Guys have show they can do it in the past. I'm really curious.	[]
"Sarah Connor, Diana Prince, Nancy Kerrigan, Ripley.

All great heroes, never bothered me a bit that they were women.
It's not the gender of the lead, it's the insipid and insulting writing.

Men are cruel, stupid, bumbling or weak.

Film art is actually for everyone. There is no distinction between men and women. On the contrary, it is this gender opposition that makes the core of the film wrong from the beginning. I have watched some failed films. For example, She-Hulk is a complete self-entertainment. Men and women are the same in terms of inferiority. But men think about more problems when thinking about problems, while women only think about themselves. This makes women actually more unreliable most of the time. It's like before, male scammers were in power, and now it's female scammers. But they do the same thing.	[]
Remember when the MCU was peak?	[]
It is women like these who bully other girls at work, school etc - terrible role models.  Most of my girl mates have suffered at the hand of a woman like that at work.	[]
"The problem was never female lead characters. Sigourney Weaver in the role of Ellen Ripley is still one of my all-time favourite characters in cinema.
No, the problem is the writing surrounding the character.
No gender, ideology, moral and ethical issues or message can make up for shit writing.

The ""strong, female protagonist"" cliche is just a manifestation of shit writing. They are one-dimensional, completely unlikeable and unrelatable arseholes, often with bloated egos and a can-do-no-wrong attitude.

EDIT: Come to think of it. Add a Newt to a Girlboss story, and see how they'd react..."	[]
Hope rhey stop making cgi trash. I like model effects. Much better	[]
"I think women are generally not into going to movies on their own. It's just too expensive, requires logistics and doing something else while watching is frowned upon.
That's why predictable, easy to watch tv-format shows are immensely more popular with women than movies are.
That's my theory anyway.
Oh and to the wamen who's replying angrily to this right now after somehow stumbling upon this video - I don't mean you, okay? You're special and different."	[]
"There are plenty of well-written strong and intelligent ladies mind you throughout even in contemporary years, the house of the dragon like Rhaenyra,Rhaenys, Alicent, the expanse cast like Noami, Drummer, Draper and the legendary Chrisjen Avasarala which can be seen as feminist icons. 

The problem with girlbosses isnt that they are just badly written, or that they push the blatant political agenda, the problem is that the writers, the directors or the showrunners have a tendency to use their political stance as a shield to disingenuously defend their terrible works and lacklustre skills, simultaneously hoping to call upon people of similar political persuasion to mindlessly help with the defence online and get plenty of free publicity that they hope would translate to eventual ticket sales. Glad to see this is trend is now buckling at the weight of its own apparent stupidity."	[]
Another reason these movies are not resonating with the female audience, is that typically American based Hollywood thinks they knows what females globally actually want. This concept of girlboss/female power is very western minded. You go to countries like Japan/Korea, women are into cutesy culture and bright coloured kawii stuff. Totally missing the mark. Californian liberals say they are multi-cultured but probably have never travelled outside the US and talk to real locals about anything else	[]

"The 10% of males who attend romance movies are trying to get laid. They're not there for the story. LOL.

But you are SOOOOOO correct! I'm a tomboy. Always have been. I enjoy action movies, sci-fi, military fiction, and suspense... with strong MALE leads and strong female leads when they make sense. Sure, women in those movies as a protagonist is an added bonus, but the main thing they need to reflect the target audience of the women watching them, specifically tomboys. Tomboys who aren't there to tear down the patriarchy. The ""patriarchy"" are our best friends, the people we hang around the most. Stop emasculating them! Stop making them the ""bad guy"" for standing up and doing what men do... fight bad guys to protect the people they love. 

The thing I hated the most about the last 3 Star Wars movies were: Poe being treated like an idiot and discredited or ignored when he was clearly a good leader, Luke turned into a total pansy instead of the GREATEST Jedi of all time, Kylo's terrible character arc making him whiny and unenjoyable, and Rey being a Mary Sue!"

Meanwhile you got male superheros that are just trying to do what's right. They're not trying to be right, they're just trying to be the good Samaritan. I feel like captain marvel had a lot of potential as a character even though she's hated in comics. While watching the movie I was thoroughly enjoying up until they started pushing the narrative that because she's a  woman, she can't this and that. And at that point she's just turned into a plot point that won't evolve from I am a woman so I can do anything better then any men because I'm a woman. And the male characters all act like they had a lobotomy because they're main goal is to feed that narrative by becoming obnoxious and unrelatable/unlikable antagonist."	[]

I know some actors or actresses are toxic and you just wanna hate them, but i think the majority of movies suffer not because of the actors themselves but from the poor script they have. Some have even stepped forwards and told us that directly. So ... i think the problem is the industry itself, not just part of it. It needs to be burned to the ground and reforged. Either that or im just gonna focus on foreign films and tv from now on.	"[""Agreed. No matter how talented any actor is, if they're handed a garbage script there's only so much they can do with it.""]"
"It's appalling how in 21st century we still conflate femaleness with femininity. Femaleness is simply being a woman, in all her shapes and sizes. Doesn't matter what she wears and how she behaves, she's a woman through and through. Femininity is a man-made construct, a kind of cage to put women in and force into a premade role, behavior and looks, eg. long hair, frilly dresses, softness and naivety. That's BS.  That's not what women are like and who they are, that's what YOU want them to be. Sucks but we don't care.

Now ladies, some of what these failed abortions called males are saying IS true, there's no going around it. He is stronger than you and your wobbly arms and chicken legs are proof you are weak af  If you really want to one up a moid in a fight, learn the arts of knife combat, baseball bats (those steel ones, there's a how-to self defense on TikTok made by a woman, moids hated it, imagine that) and strap up. If possible, learn which herbs and chemicals can make a moid sleep forever. Aqua Tofana, anyone? They are not called The Great Equalizers for nothing :0 no moid is immune to those, foolproof. They bleed just the same :)

Don't worry about not looking feminine or fckable to these semenal demons, that's what this backlash is all about. They don't want you strong, muscular and independent because that thing between his legs doesn't get up if you are, no, they want you to be scared, helpless but looking absolutely eye candy to them. Fck that, hit the gym, learn how to fire a gun and slice up a scrote. Decenter nem and BS they are spewing all day every day ever since you got the right to vote and own your bank account. Those horror slasher movies of the 70s were nothing but male backlash against women's growing independence. Goddess forbid we do a YouTube video on how ridiculous male leads in movies are. But they won't cuz moids are allowed to fantasize."	[]

Nobody, not men, not women, want to watch dog sh*t like that. Also I am not a lesbian, so I go to watch superhero movies to see strong men, and ""strong female lead characters"" don't do anything for me apart from make me want to vomit. If I want to watch a woman being a woman, I watch chic flics like the Notebook. Female creators have destroyed the fantasy and sci-fi movie genres..."	[]

I think the girl boss in movies experiment has another very interesting sociological result. We now know that movies and media cannot completely change people into something they do not want to become. In the 80's, there was a lot of talk about the lack of female role models in movies and literature. Most women were depicted as weak, supporting and supplementary to their male counterparts. Some were even kind of useless for the hero and mostly a comedic relief or nuisance such as Willie in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I agree that this useless but constantly nagging women trope is boring and not particularly interesting. I suspect that the girl boss fantasy is some kind of over reaction to this, but few seems to like it.	[]

"Genres can be made to appeal to a different audience but you have to be aware of what that audience values and enjoys 
I have experienced this firsthand with one of my own YouTube channels. Romance is generally considered a female genre yet I write romances and my audience not only is growing but all of my subscribers are male.
Why?
Well, because unlike other romances, I imbue my female characters with traits that men find appealing in romance like emotional empathy, the ability to recognize faults in themselves, and the willingness to take risks for someone that matters to them.
If you want to get women in the theatre seats or in front of the television then you need to imbue female characters with traits women find noble and I mean actual women not the feminist fanatics currently writing in the industry. These women do not accurately represent the audience these studios wish to snare and the numbers back that up."	[]

"I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy. I was def on the Oppenheimer side. I also greatly enjoyed Dune 1 and 2. Bene Gesserit are hella badass. Before that I went to see Napoleon, kinda meh. Cinema is expensive - I'll generally only spend money on epic movies that trully benefit from the big screen.  Oh, and I'm also a woman.

These movies do not have me as an audience. They do not interest me at all.
What makes me mad that they're so obviously pandering, instead of actually developing female character. Writers obviously only have surface knowledge of the material and hold no love for it. Just as an example with Marvel - why not tell the story of young Freya for a female character or young Hella and how war and hatred twisted her into a villian. If you want a gender-bending sex for anyone or anything - make a Loki movie. He's cannon shape-shifter that ocassionally gets pregnant.

Why the hell go for female WH40k female custodes. You could go for a badass sister story, or a psyker. Or again if you want a gender ambigous character make a story centered on the mechanicus. The fans would be happy and the non-fan audience doesn't know what they don't know.

Also it makes me unhappy when they erase social inequalities. For me sci-fi and fantasy have always been also a philosophical playground. A place where you can explore humanity vices and ethical what ifs, without the backlash of putting it into our real world and all the historical baggage that comes with it. 

PSS: I'm also Eastern European and hella mad about Witcher. The whoooooole managment team hadn't had a single member Slav/person of Slavic descent present. Just saying."	[]
These people don't understand the basic principle that masculine-oriented products are universally appealing.  Look at cars.  Women love muscle cars, trucks right along with men. The death knell of a vehicle is if it is considered a chick car.  It'll seldom sell well.  Many women have no problem wearing men's, or at least masculine clothing.  Women and men want to see strong male protagonists in movies.  Chick flicks, on the other hand, appeal to a smaller share of women. There's always a handful of exceptions, but it's always been this way.  Men will always make the world turn.  Sorry, ladies.  Not sorry.	[]

It's not completely true that men and women like different things. There are films that pull in both men and women such as Everywhere...all at once, Avatar, Hereditary, M3gan (women I know love smart horror) and so on, but to your point: stop trying to make films clearly targeting women in a genre men prefer but then being disappointed when men don't show up.  Barbie was okay, but Top Gun was a stupid macho reboot. This guy hates that mindless machoness, and it would have been worse with a female macho pilot.

"They don't want to put the puzzle piece in place because it refutes the core argument of their political ideology. That is, ""where men are overrepresented, its because its an all boys club and they discriminate against women"". It is societies obligation to NEVER question ""maybe men are better at some things than women"" or ""maybe men have different preferences than women"", because if that is allowed to be legitimately considered, it will be shown as true, and much of their political activism would quickly be understood to be dogma and not scientific at all.

 These activists also hold to their core that women are JUST BETTER than men, and will never self-reflect to examine why they think so, or how much they are forcing discrimination against men in order to try to prove this. The people who make stories centered around men, while often fantasy, are much more in touch with reality. Men have to work extremely hard to succeed, and even male super heroes dont get free rides. Whereas these political activists are out of touch with reality and have very few real life examples of things like women dying in coal mines, or losing everything in a divorce, or actually facing extreme poverty and fighting to survive without significant help from family or activist policies. The ""male fantasies"" are generally based on actual experiences men run into, and have real life examples to draw inspiration from. These political activist fantasies do not, but their core premise is that ""women are just better than men"", so they feel the need to show women doing fantastical things that typically only men ever achieve, and doing so with easy or little struggle.

 This is where the Mary-Sue trope actually comes from - desiring reality to push one's political agenda when it does not. A  Male Mary-Sue basically never happens in a serious context - because it is so out of touch with reality that it can only occur as a comedy, like One Punch Man, or The Tick.

 The nerdy/gamer audience tends to be in opposition to the self-declared altruistic social activists who always seem to coincidentally only be activists for causes that benefit themselves or their political perspectives in some way. This is why gamergate happened over a decade ago - because gamers tend to not become journalists, and these political activist types who love to be journalists tend to hate gaming and gaming culture, which causes a massive drift between ""gaming journalism"" and actual gaming and the people who play them.

I have never been into super heros or comics, but I imagine it is a somewhat similar situation."	[]

In my opinion; it's the majority of American people's fault.  Their governments (comprised of the people in it), actively push for nonsense things like women in.... everything.  American pre-runners (the British) didn't do that and were fine until a certain couple of wars hit their shores and bankrupted them.  Women have their place in their societies, they don't need to be pushed to everything that males almost always done.  It finally gets into cultural things like movies... if a movie didn't push women to be better than or equal to the men, then they are labeled hate speech or maybe even misogynist, and a group will press a lawsuit onto the studio, and social media (at the behest of the government) will ban the studio.  It's a multipronged attack to keep the movies in this dilemma.  I'm glad that money will bankrupt this foolishness from the studios and compel others to create better stories for people.	[]

Critical Drinker, You should do a review on the Black Sails series.  It was a good series.  To me the series was written by average intelligence people, but, some how, managed to write a good yarn (as Shakespeare would say).   In many ways, the series could be considered Woke.  Normally, I hate anything Woke.  But, historically, Pirates were the most degenerate people (mush worse than how the series portrayed them as).  So, I guess I am saying that the Woke are degenerate people?	[]
The problem with these hollywood writers as of late is that they think they are great writers, but have never written anything great.	[]

The girlboss archetype is a crude mockery of femininity, they aren‚Äôt female, they have no identifiable character, and are not strong in the ways a woman or Lady should be. All the traits deemed ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô in men, are promoted and encouraged in these shallow ‚Äòrepresentations‚Äô, which makes the girlboss into a shrill sociopathic psychopath of a character, a pushy and narcissistic hollow entity that appeals to neither men or women.	[]
I hate to tell you this (ok, no, I don't) but women like technology, advanced fighter jets and logic just as much - and are capable of enjoying entertainment centered on all of those if they want to; Top Gun Maverick had, if you noticed? well-written women among the characters and it was noted, and loved by many women. I adored Phoenix - she was just as sassy, competent, flawed and successful as her cohorts; not because or despite her plumbing. Penny just the same! A successful and capable individual who had weaknesses and strengths. The original Lea in SW 4,5,6 comes to mind. How about Ripley in Aliens? I love how she was written. You don't like how males are badly written in recent movies? Now you know how women feel about 99% of how we are represented in blockbusters and why we don't buy tickets - because we expect to cringe and we aren't masochistic enough to pay to get insulted. Now both women and men are written horribly, in the examples you named!	[]
The retirement of the girl boss will be a glorious day	[]
People don't have a problem with female led movies. The problem is that the writers just make female leads amazing, perfect, and flawless in everything they do. The last thing we want to see is someone perfect who doesn't struggle and overcome their flaws whether it be male or female	[]

"The MCU basically died in 2019 with Endgame when they killed off Natasha and Tony Stark and sent Captain America back to the past. The writers say people have ""superhero fatigue"" but they seem to have forgotten how sucessful those movies were only 10 years ago. 

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still considered one of the most popular MCU movies: but in those days we still had characters like Natasha. She was badass, but she was also flawed and had realistic conflict which was not simply based on her gender. Plus her banter with Cap was some of the best. 

Then of course there's the way they've shafted my boy Bucky (my favourite MCU character). For a while it seemed like he was being positioned to become the new Captain America, which he did in the comics for a time... but alas, that never happened and instead they seem to have forgotten he existed in favour of girlbosses. I guess the MCU no longer has time for white male characters."	[]

So I want to see strong CHARACTERS with flaws that grow and improve, men or women	[]
You want the female audience for superhero movies?  Put in lots of male/female romance, much more beautiful costumes, and love, love, love.  Oh, yes, and lots of male/male fights.	[]
"REGARDING ""GIRL BOSS""/ FEMINISM- FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WOKENESS

Generally, i do NOT have any issue whether a character is ""BOSS"" or not irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, etc .... my PRIORITY is the story, good writing and implementation which includes without contradicting pre-established canon and lore for existing franchises.

For the example.... 

I find it quite odd that folks attack Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies for being  for pro-feminism wokeness yet the EXACT SAME FOLKS love and embrace ATOMIC BLONDE movie which is actually MORE WOKE pro-feminist above both Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies COMBINED.

Atomic Blonde is actually a better movie and many will agree on this yet it is MORE WOKE with *FEMALE EMPOWERMENT*.... Ask yourself why?!?

*Simple.... Because Atomic Blonde is a BETTER WRITTEN MOVIE even with its WOKE female empowerment-ism.*

EVERY MEDIA WE HAVE WATCHED THAT SHOWS A WOMAN DEFEATING A MAN IN ANYTHING IS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT and we have enjoyed many of them such as the KILL BILL movies. 

Some good and some bad.... Applies to ALL MEDIA doesn't matter if its woke or not. 

Atomic Blonde is NOT a perfect movie but still far better and more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels despite being more woke.

Breakdown....

(1) ....Atomic Blonde being able to tank direct hits from well trained MALE agents better than them without superpowers, no assistance or extra abilities makes her more woke than Captn Marvel +  The Marvels whose extra super powers makes her and them  (Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel, Photon) almost invulnerable which provides extra-boost protection from damage.

Atomic Blonde makes the case for women being able to fight trained male fighters in direct combat like in UFC, Muay Thai and Boxing or whatever combat sports which is what the  extremist feminists are pushing IRL.

*Compared to Captn Marvel + The Marvels movies*.....

....that makes the case that women can NOT match men in direct combat without physical augmentation/ extra powers to make the women more powerful.*  Remember the scene at the end of Captain Marvel where the male villain said...

 ...[paraphrasing]... Lets fight without the powers, switch them off and challenge me.... [Captn Marvel refused and instead BLASTED HIM with an energy beam].

The ""message"" here is brutally crystal clear.

 Atomic Blonde heavily implies that if women pushed hard enough (like extremist feminists are doing) under their own natural  strength and endurance without support or assistance  or NO augmentation or extra-powers of any kind... a woman can ass whoop multiple men SINGLEHANDEDLY in direct combat.

 This has been the case for the vast greater abundant  majority (not all) of female lead action movies which involves martial arts and combat.

*And yet Atomic Blonde is much more enjoyable and BETTER movie than both Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies (+ Madam Web) COMBINED despite Atomic Blonde being more woke* .....

This is because of the BETTER WRITING and proper execution of Atomic Blonde made it a better enjoyable movie. 

(2) ....MALE VILLAINS.

Have u also noticed....greater majority (Not all) of such female action movies and/or tv shows have MALE VILLAINS as the final big boss bad guy like in the Black Widow, Atomic Blonde and even the beloved KILL BILL movies amongst very VERY many others. 

This was *NOT* in the Captn Marvel movies (Captn Marvel + The Marvels) as i pointed out earlier whereby both had female villains as the final big boss bad guy in both films.

I know that the final big boss called ""Supreme Intelligence"" in Captain Marvel movie was an alien AI but note that it presented itself as a female form/ a woman throughout the Captain Marvel movie.

(3) .....The WOKE LESBIANISM/ GAY

Notice this in Atomic Blonde movie is literally with a full-on in your face lesbian gay sex scene.

Where was the anti-woke outrage for this?

 Notice how there is no heterosexuality in the Atomic blonde and the lesbo/gay love making is literally shoved straight into the faces of the audience.  It wasn't even subtle or hinted at or innuendo but rather full blast. 

Compared to Captain Marvel movies also did not have any heterosexuality/ male-female love story but it did NOT have any sexuality in it of any kind. Instead it focused on friendship and familial bonds between best friends. 

I have seen some folks online have said Captain Marvel movie had lesbo innuendo between Captn Marvel and her best friend but that's subjective opinion which many disagree with.



TO CONCLUDE ....

Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies had several problems steming from BAD WRITING but wokeness is not part of it. 

Atomic Blonde is a better written movie which is why its more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels.

I apply the same logic to the dumpster fire trash of SHE-HULK tv series and crap-fest SECRET INVASION . 

I enjoyed MOON KNIGHT, WANDAVISION and liked FATW (though i think it NEEDED more eps to be more satisfying but it was still good).

At the end of the day if wokeness is the sole blame for ""BAD WRITING"" then by that exact same logic means that non-woke content are ALL automatically 
awe inspiring and captivatingly superb....which is NOT true.

THERE ARE BADLY WRITTEN AND GOOD WELL WRITTEN WOKE AND NON-WOKE CONTENT IN EQUAL MEASURE.

Anyhow, don't watch what u don't like.....i also tend to do this

Every word again, absolute and total common sense which the fact you are making YouTubes and I suspect not a millionaire (as yet) and there are a bunch of many millionaires possibly billionaires who gave the approval for all these 'girl bosses' movies to be made even after a great many had failed and still continue to do so.

Imagine a final fight where a monster at the top of the food chain is defeatet by this civilian, leaving the woman to be the only survivor.

Comment	[]
"I'm probably the exemption, I grew up watching action/super hero/fantasy/science fiction movies with my dad.  There's something weird about an all female lead  tv show/movie that just doesn't appeal to me.  Trust me, I've given it a chance numerous times.  It just doesn't feel natural, feels more forced, like it's literally being shoved down my throat.  In fact, I waited 5 years, to cleanse my palate before finally watching ""captain marvel"" & see for myself what the fuss was all about.  OMG that movie is so bad, I had to stop less than halfway through, forced myself to restart & watch again.  By the 5th try, it was mostly to challenge myself actually finish a bad movie.  Same with ""barbie"", it's way too girlie + felt childish for me & I didn't like it.  Give me fight scenes, explosions, fast cars, crazy flying techniques and I'm all in!!!  To date, the only girl boss type characters/scenes that I like rewatching to this day is from #TheMandalorian season 2 finale ~ where audiences see Cara Dune, Fennec Shand, BoKatan Kryze & Koska Reeves being badasses.  The best part, those characters felt so natural & they didn't take away from the lead: Din Djarin.  Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni did a good job incorporating girl power in a male lead tv series.  We see female characters winning BUT we also got an awesome fight scene between Din vs Moff Gideon.  So there's balance & Din wasn't made to look like an incapable fool who left all the hard work to his female counterparts ~~ Favreau & Filoni knew that would be pandering & they'd lose a big chunk of their action hero loving audience.  Sure a big chunk of that is male but I'm proud to be part of that audience and, so far, nothings changed my preferences in genre.  The forceful push for female leads did the opposite = totally turned me off & no amount of million dollar marketing campaigns will change my mind."	[]

"2 things WOMEN want to see, a bad *** male who is strong and handsome and HOT.. and a woman who is not some super-powered omnipotent girl boss who can do it all!

1) Women who look at girl bosses are the type they never can be, they sabotage the woman who is more successful than them! They can literally run a fortune 500 company, own a 17-billion dollar real estate property, a nice home with acres of land and a multiple story car garage, nicest clothes and her son is a A- student.. what do OTHER women focus on? ""Oh-Em-Gee!! Can you believe her son is not a straight A+ student. She prances around here like she is perfect, judging us like she is better than us! I think her husband must be having an affair. That is probably why has her kid have problems. Or she is having the affair! She is such a ***** I bet she is doing that gardener that carries the leaf blower! A totally nasty hoe and I am not talking about the gardener's tools!! *hahaha* She can't put out the fires in her own house, such a disgraceful woman!!""

2) Women want to look and fantasize about the perfect man who is all ""I will be there for you baby but I will be here if you need me. I will not fight your battles but I will not let you lose! I will always protect you even when I am the one who hurting you. I will step back out of your life even if it hurts me because i love you even if you hate me!"" That is the type of Men that women go see in movies because they seem like a fantasy they will search the world over looking for the one ounce of the perfect man and settle for the man who MOSTLY fits that criteria..

Going back there has been PLENTY of women who loved comics, plenty of women who watch superhero movies but the thing is you have to focus on the great aspects of the character. Women who find that type of Thor masculinity HOT, the idea of a Iron-Man who can sweep a girl off her feet with everything she ever wanted to experience and leave her breathless, or the angsty Spider-Man who is aloof but deeply loves someone who is constantly ignored.. women see those types are find something SEXY about them, that is why they GOT POPULAR.. Boys wanted to be the Barbarian because girls responded to the Jocks in school, Boys wanted to be Spider-Man because he was nerdy, doing things they wished they could do if they had the chance, Girls who would flirt with the nerdy boys who believed they was undeserving of the goddesses attention, feeling like Icarus.. if they fly to close to the sun they will burn up.. 


Women I know loved the story ""The Night Gwen Stacy Died"" it was George Stacy dying and he promised him to protect Gwen even from Spider-Man, he knew she loved him too much to ever give up. It was up to Peter to call it off. Gwen was confused as why he became distant. They worked it out but eventually she died, Peter never truly moved on even when he married Mary Jane who he believed he was out of her league. Her legacy was so deep it impacted his life more than Mary Jane ever could. He took all that love for Gwen and used it on her. As a woman this is how some women think- ""I taught your boyfriend that thing you liked"".. nothing like looking at their relationship from a distance and seeing how changed that selfish couch potato into a tender loving-caring guy who they can't live without. Who could not smile knowing it. -This is what WOMEN should be doing, not tearing down men to be below them! When you succeed at making them successful, when your friends are better with you in their life people are dependent on you. You start to feel better about yourself and that is how it always was in ""Feminine Culture"" and why Trans-Women just don't get it"	[]
Everyone has a different perspective, but as a woman who likes men, part of the appeal in these kind of movies is the men lmao. I don't need a female role model or to see myself represented on the screen. Sure, I get annoyed if the woman is reduced to eye candy or if she's useless, but you can have a cool female character without turning her into an insufferable girl boss.	[]
Once you understand that the Cultural Marxists don‚Äôt care about the bottom line and have weaponized both capitalism and entertainment to spread as much propaganda as possible to corrupt and destroy Western civilization, it all makes sense.	[]
As much contempt as I have for the girl boss bullshit this whole scenario covers a much broader and a far more critical and insidious spectrum of western culture with Britain and America in the forefront . Say what you want and be outraged as much as you like but America began its gradual downward spiral from greatness to to moral and spiritual bankruptcy when in the early1920s WEAK MEN allowed women to vote , hold office and authority OVER men . Whether you agree or not IReally could care less . You are now witnessing this foolishness coming to full fruition. Wherever traditional and proper male tradition in leadership roles is touched by women those roles and affective leadership is dumbed down and diminished . That includes the military , police forces , judiciary , state and federal government and managerial positions that have ALWAYS been the proper roles of MEN . We now live in an efeminized America . NOT the America I grew up in . Single whorish mother households supported by a socialist regeme . Rampant crime , homosexuality and homosexual marriage , lgbtqrstuvwhyz , This is all DAMNING FRUITS of WEAK MEN and WEAK LEADERSHIP . Whine , cry , wring the hands and knash your teeth but THIS ISTRUTH. America once was .	[]

We cancelled Disney+ and haven't subbed since."	[]
The studios thought the female demographic was a growth market. Female entertainment is primarily reality shows, true crime, and HGTV. There isn't enough broadband in the female attention market for full length movies.	[]
One thing that needs to be considered about females that are part of a target audience is that im guessing a majority of those females going to see these movies are going because their boyfriend is going. Im too lazy to do any research but id bet that there is barely a desparity in male to female audience with romantic movies because most people are there with their SO. Marvel making a superhero movie for females primarily is generally only going to get the percentage of females that are willing to go see this by themselves or with female friends that like the genre also.

"I don't know how you younger guys feel, but do you really want to see ANY women in the cockpit for a Maverick movie?  Realistically, I don't see women ever being able to perform at the same level as men behind the controls.  Yes, they exist but, of course, how many are there to fill quotas?  Like all of them? ¬†When the Israeli military experimented with women in battle, all they would say about it was that it had ""mixed results.""  When the US military tried pitting all male combat teams against all female teams and then mixed gender team, guess what order they ended up in?  All male first by a long shot, followed by mixed teams, followed by all female teams--again by a long shot.  And this study measured all kinds of combat effectiveness from PT through war gaming.

If a girl wants to go see a Maverick movie (probably because her boyfriend dragged her there) and if you want to cater to the few women who end up in the seats, then make girl roles in girl subjects of interest.  Forever it was men doing the action and women who love them, which was reciprocated.  It was always the point in the movie that men would go for popcorn, but it worked.  Each got a part of the movie made for them.  And if there was more guy stuff in a movie it was because that was the target audience.

"""Hollywood can still make movies with kick-ass female heroes...""

No, they can't.  Hollywood can attempt to ""re-focus"" on stories and characters that men like all they want but if the girlboss door is left even slightly ajar, the temptation to return to that well will be too strong to resist.  I can easily see a scenario where there's a tiny blip of stories with competent, cool male leads that are still paired with the same overpowered, hyper-competent female architype, but slightly less so.  And they'll win some decent returns because men are so starved for _any_ strong male hero with a pulse.  But as soon as the money starts flowing again, studios will learn exactly the wrong lesson.  They'll think that they've finally solved the woman-led story problem and revert back to the same excruciatingly awful girlboss trope, just with a slightly less pathetic male sidekick.

It will take a HUGE pendulum swing back to 80s-era action movies with unapologetically traditional sex roles (guy saves the girl) for several years to begin to undo the damage."	[]
They just made Damsel, wtf are you talking about?	[]
"I'm just so tired of these forceful girl power movies that usually just have the same sexist tropes as movies with male protagonists but reversed. Here it's the female lead who can
do anything, has to save the day, is liked by everyone and those who don't like her are either evil or become friends later on. Why not just give us movies with two leads, male
and female, who are both equally important and strong? Or non-binary protagonists? Trans? I honestly don't care as long as we get well-written characters again that one can
identify and empathize with."	[]

It‚Äôs an agenda folks. Emasculate men. It‚Äôs everywhere. Hollywood doesn‚Äôt care about losing money. They‚Äôll make a good movie here and there that makes billions. They are targeting young boys and girls, trying to destroy the strong, kind, caring, assertive, smart masculine identity that male heroes used to portray. Creating beta males, and girl bosses who don‚Äôt need men to protect them, or to have a family of her own to be happy. The family unit is under attack.	[]
South Korean movies and tv shows are good because they have strong female characters that are feminine with character arcs.  It is a pleasure watching them even with the subtitles.

Critical you are the best. I share your videos with my best friend and my 78 year old mom.	[]
"I have to agree and disagree with you. The role of women in classic sci-fi movies (and books) was more or less just ""wife of the astronaut"". That changed during the 80s and you could see more women enjoying those kind of movies (and becoming astronauts or scientists in the real world). So I guess that role models do make a difference and they reduce the gap between ""boy-brands"" and ""girl-brands"". Modern sci-fi-movies with ""girl-bosses"" and ""strong-female-characters"" do not appeal to women, because the characters are absolutely terrible! The studios could have succeded in drawing more women towards the sci-fi or action genres by writing more female heroes (and lead-characters - not sidekicks) that were actually behaving like real people and not like compete idiots. Female heroes like Kira Nerys (Ds9), Buffy Summers, Lela (Futurama), Zoe (Firefly), Susan Ivanova (Babylon 5). Oh look, 30 years ago the future looked bright..."	[]

My best friend is obsessed with Star Wars.  She didn‚Äôt even fall for the Member Berries in Force Awakens because she was so livid that they‚Äôd scrapped every ‚Äústrong female character‚Äù in the extended universe (she read allllll the books) in order to effectively gender swap Luke but give him no character development.

Didn‚Äôt see Madame Web because it looked like crap, the effects were crap, and they recruited some plank of wood from the Twilight fanfic movies to be a born awesome girl boss.

And inevitably when we get the whole ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry ladies you never have to work at anything you‚Äôre born great grrrl power‚Äù message, we don‚Äôt even get fun villains, just paper tigers for the girl boss with all the midichlorians or chi or whatever to neatly dispatch without effort.

The worst examples would be the first Captain Marvel and harley Quinn movie in my eyes.

A lot of people need to realize that we don't have any problem at all with strong female characters as males. At all. Quite the opposite.

We can smell a panderer coming easier than most would think and I never want to be pandered to even in things I do relate to, such as my ethnicity. Lots of female characters are great and I genuinely enjoy them. Ripley is fuckin awesome, Sarah Connor is fuckin awesome, Lizbeth Salander is fucking awesome (pretty much anything Noomi Rapace plays, tbh lol), Katniss Everdeen was pretty great considering the YA tropes, Clarice Starling, Buffy, Jyn Erso, Arya Stark, Xena, Princess/General Leia, Brienne of Tarth and last but not least, motherfuckin Imperator Furiosa.

Girl Bosses are cool, sometimes even cooler than guy bosses ... when done right.  Take Kill Bill for example, Aliens, T2 Judgment day and the list goes on and on.  The issue is the intention behind these stories, they focus on the wrong things just to bring a message without building a good story that makes sense.  Most of Hollywood is focused on an agenda, just deliver the message the lazy way.  You could deliver a strong message if you had a good strong story behind it you know?  I am all for equity and balance and recognition for all human beings regardless of race, sexual orientation, faith etc.  But true equity , true balance, what Hollywood is doing right now is the completely and total opposite.  Overcorrection and over compensation for things of the past have never works well, equity is going back to the middle and staying there making sure the game is fair for every one.	[]

Thank you for pointing out the obvious, who watches Superhero films, boys (or men who haven't quite grown up), I watched a science fiction film on TV with my wife, too many years ago to remember, and she had as much interest in it as watching paint dry and vice versa. Look the sexes are different and they watch different things, you can get boyfriends to watch some romance thing (If they have any sense, we pretend to enjoy the tosh) but get a girlfriend to go to a film with superheroes in, nah she has more important things to do like washing her hair or similar (After all they are more sensible). The above is a gross generalisation and is not to be taken seriously, honest.	[]
"Females are *hypergamous*. Meaning, they aspire to men who are above their station and will leave a lower-status male for a higher-status male. How does this pertain to the failure of the girl-boss genre? The vast majority of women (ie outside Hollywood writing rooms) do not fantasize about dominating men. They fantasize about men who are wealthier, handsomer, more respected, and more capable than they are themselves. This is because of genetic/evolutionary signaling that this male would make the best possible father for my offspring. What they get in the girlboss genre is weak men who fail and lose status. This simply does not correlate with the majority of female fantasy/ideal, and therefore is doomed to fail. The analog would be an action hero flick where the girl rescued by the hero is fat, dumpy, whiny, and slow. It would fail to capture the male rescue fantasy and would be a loser at the box office.

Hollywood can still make a girlboss flick, but they will need to make the male character competent and strong, and probably somewhat aloof and alluring. The girlboss doesn't have to fall for the male - she can still be powerful in herself - but they need to acknowledge that the girlboss is at least a tiny bit aware of his presence and holds a sliver of respect for him and doesn't simply debase him outright. That alone would boost the numbers of men AND women who'd go to see the film."	[]
"These people forget what an actual, well-rounded strong individual looks like, because all of them are weird anti-social narcissists. If you were alive at the time or you watched some classics, Voyager had Captain Janeway and she WAS the definition of a girl-boss without throwing it in your face. Carter from Stargate, Doctor Weir from Atlantis,  Sarah Connor.. I mean the list goes on endlessly if you life isn't a perpetual Twitter/X feed. Same goes for Black actors, or whatever race you want to toss in the bucket.

No one actually cared, or even gave it a second thought, because the stories were incredible and the actors took your mind to another world where these things don't exist. Isn't that what we should be striving for again? Maybe forget about the in-your-face political propaganda and just show how great the world is when we all fight for a common goal."	[]

The big success of the first 3 Star Wars with a powerful female role was the dynamic between Solo and Leia. Leia was a powerful female character on her own, but Solo was an equal and complimentary juxtaposition. If episodes 4, 5 & 6 were made now, with the current pandering, we would see Han Solo reduced to...well...Poe. It seemed Poe's sole purpose was to have inadequacies in any given situation that were easily revoked by any given female character: Leia in leadership; Rey in self-reliance, Tico in dedication; and whoever that Laura Dern character was that just popped-up long enough to make the ultimate self-sacrifice-play. Needless to say, I am done with the Star Wars thing, because the vision Lucas had of making a western genre with spaceships has clearly died somewhere along the trail.	[]

I still think there's a lot of untapped potential in badass female characters. It remains untapped because at first (1990s, early 2000s) it relied entirely on the novelty of women kicking ass, then it became political and went straight from that to horribly done in every possible way.	[]

Why do they think female audiences only want to watch movies with female leads? This is flawed to begin with. Showing female perspectives (meaning, showing what the female characters think instead of treating them like objects with no viewpoints or like a collective character) is one thing, and showing female leads or ‚Äùbadass‚Äù females is another. All the good movies I've ever seen show female perspectives, though most of them don't have a female lead. We just want movies focused on quality rather than a message.	[]

"A good example of great writing for strong female characters is Avatar the Last Airbender. If you notice a lot of the prominent strong characters are female. Katara, Toph, Azula, Ty lee, Mai, and suki. 

We enjoy that one of the strongest character was a blind young girl. 

We dont feel like the characters are strong solely because they are women, they are strong because of who they are as a person.

We didn‚Äôt complain when there was an episode with just Toph and katara doing girl things. I thought it was a great episode. It felt like it was written well and you really feel for Toph. 

It all comes down to good writing for the story and characters."	[]

It's like these people started watching movies in 2017. They just ignore all the movies and media that have already done all the stuff they are trying to do with strong, kickass female characters. One example of them doing this is Jennifer Lawrence going on about how she was the first female action star. These movies are further examples of them failing to acknowledge the past so they can continue to misdiagnose present societal issues (because, of course, they are so arrogant as to assume it is their duty to diagnose and cure societal ills). Their sole creative work is constructing the imaginary world they live in.	[]
The worst thing is that girls belive it is true. My girlfriends 7 y. old thinks she can beat up every boy in her class, ms. Marvel (or whatever) said she can.

Plot can be engaging no matter the the lead being male/female. BUT if you make the plot HINGE on that you can EASILY get cringe on both sides if it isn't written as near perfect as possible. The Barbie and Maverick comparison was great. The gender of the lead can bring depth to the plot without dulling it or making it difficult to follow for action movies. See Dune 1 and now ESPECIALLY in Dune 2. Fantastic female characters, written with incredible complexity, and would be compelling if they happened to be male but are INCREDIBLY MORE complex as female.	[]

The problem is not necessarily the gender. It's mostly the writing and direction. Take Amazon's ROF for example.

"The only Marvel Girlboss is probably Nebula /Gamora but they are never main characters.

However, like it or not, the first Wonder Woman was one of the best displays on the big screen for a super heroine. I absolutely love how badass she is in that movie. Nothing was forced either.

As a woman, I love watching fantasy, action, marvel and sci-fi. But I watch the ones that mainly have male leads.

They make the mistake with recent Disney too, so it‚Äôs not just female bias film types that are failing in this. Soon I won‚Äôt know what the hell to watch. üòë"	[]

Girlboss concepts shouldn't be dead. I don't want them to be dead. I just need them to be written like their male counterparts.  None of us would have enjoyed Ironman if Tony Stark spent 90% of the movie in his suit and was 100% invulnerable to any danger coming his way.  Instead, he was portrayed as an arrogant man with a god complex, and although likable and funny, his traits needed to undergo scrutiny and adjustment throughout many movies...from IM1 to Avengers Endgame. I even liked Wonderwoman.  She had flaws.  She had to learn how to use her powers responsibly.  They kind of derailed her character in the follow-up movie though (leaning into the strong Wahmen trope), and ended up being worse off for it. What pisses me off is that everything strong female characters can overcome as part of their journeys is right there already...primed to be explored.  IF Spiderman could struggle with his anonymity and letting go of his love interest in favor of keeping her safe while he does what he needs to do as a hero, why can't similarly powerful female characters not have the same exploration journey? Why has having feelings for someone from the opposite sex become such a big no-no for strong female characters? Why did having to juggle a personal life and their hero duties become something completely absent from their story arcs? Why have the mcguffin they require to spring into action become so impersonal, mundane and handed to one-dimensional villains with 3 IMDB movie credits. They have the recipe.  They simply need to look at any comic book movie made from 2000 to 2016 to find all the ingredients they need to make a strong female superhero character work. I'm not saying every single MArvel movie ever made before 2016 was equal in quality, but they all (at least) had heart. With a good story, real struggles, and a director that knows what they are doing there is no reason strong female led comic book movies cant work.  But as long as they persist with ding what they are doing right now, they are literally going to continue to flush money down the drain.  I love that Dakota Johnson even criticized the movie. AND didnt venture into blaming the male audience for Madame Web's failure.	[]

"This might just be me: I was heavily into comics growing up. I admit I don't know a lot of the newer stories and publications, but I didn't seem Marvels in theaters because the trailer lacked a plot and I knew nothing about the boring looking villain. We all know, that most of what sells in Marvel is visual and not 'depth or story'. For Madam Web, I just haven't gotten to the theater because 'Dune' and 'Out of Darkness' took priority. Why? Because the Madam Web trailer lacks a plot and recognizable villain; I'm sorry if I don't know how Snake Eye's brother is or how his 1.8 percent presence in the trailer is supposed to clue me in on anything I care about.

wild honestly that females can't seem to figure out whats appealing for themselves... when most people know its rom com style stuff they've never been big action super hero crowd maybe some horror but if theres not some steamy romance or drama probably can count on women not being interested. If you added like a couple hot male supporting characters as love interests creating some love triangle drama it would probably be a bigger hook for a female audience then all female main cast doing typical male super hero stunts. In fact if you played hard into the current OF/high body count culture going around today it would unironically sell basically glorifying banging tons of dudes and not being faithful and willing to sell your sexuality probably would be a very attractive narrative to modern day women who engage in that stuff at least in america over seas it'll probably tank hard though.

"As a woman I loved Starbuck and Buffy and Sydney (Alias), Ripley and Princess Leia and Black Widow and others that rang true in the universe it depicted. They didn't sideline or eliminate or negate the presence of men. They were organic and weren't out to demonize all male characters.
I avoid films that either destroy iconic male heroes (Star wars, Terminator, Indiana Jones sequels) or just drop a bunch of females into a poorly written story and think I'll bite.
When did hot male heroes and super heroes go out of fashion for the heterosexual female? It hasn't for me."	[]
"At this point it's going to take a lot more than just making entertainment that men like to get the male audience to come back. It isn't just that Hollywood tried to make movies that didn't appeal to a male audience, that's no problem whatsoever. It's that they built franchises that blatantly appealed to men, made a boatload of money off of us and then flipped every single one of those franchises to do everything they possibly could to shit on men then called us racist sexist homophobe bigot troglodytes when we inevitably didn't like it for decades on end.

I'm never going back to Marvel. I'm never going back to Star Wars. I ignore most of Hollywood at this point, the only movie I plan to go see this entire year is the second part of Dune. I never cared before, but nowadays if there's certain production companies, studios, executives, actors or franchises involved in a movie I'm NEVER going to go see it because I absolutely refuse to give money to people who blatantly hate me for existing."

I have to respectfully disagree with a couple points here. Feminine identify and not female identity.

I saw maverick 5 x in the theater. It was also appealing to people who loved Top Gun . Great movie on edge of seat and heart warming. And it appealed to those folks (ladies) who like beach scenes. 

And I really can‚Äôt stand the changing of established stories and characters that everyone loves and happen to be male copied  and duped into female characters. As if that is magically an improvement. I hate the copying. It is unoriginal and not empowering."	[]

No man wants to sit in a movie where all they do is trash men. The problem with these female led superhero movies is the fact that they can't just have the movie with constantly taking jabs at men or stating how much women are better than men at everything. If a male superhero fights a woman and wins that's all there is to it but when a female superhero defeats a man it has to be followed up with some kind of smart remark in regards to women being better and stronger than men. Also every woman is a mary sue. They are all more than capable, more intelligent than any man, and no matter their experience they can do anything they try their hand at better than those who are experts at said thing.	[]
"Why i hate lot of these kind of girl boss movies

Girls were bosses in some movies. But being women are biologically and mentally different, they just fit in well when needed at logically lower percentages. Tomb Raider, Kill Bill, League of The Own (Baseball Movie), and tuns more. But it was balanced to only some are, aka normal percentile, not pushed, not a take-over men's rolls thing (aka men are not trying to take over Pretty Women rolls.)And men liked those movies then. So they always had boss women in 1) logical percentages 2) with no push 3) still the right roles spread out for women, not just all power 4)  Way better non-agenda writers.	[]
Excellent observations.  And in a way, the percentages are surely worse than you present.   If traditional superhero movies are 65% male viewers, WHO are the 35% women?   In most cases, they are girlfriends who are going along with, just to 'go along'.   I know my girlfriend would not go to a Super Hero movie alone, or with her girlfriends.  But is happy to go if I wish to.   Same for many of my friends.    How can Studios be so clueless??	['There are many more female fans that that percentage. And have you ever thought the girlfriends enjoy it and are fans too?']

And let's face it, Silk is for men anyway.  It's a story about a Spider Girl character that runs around mostly naked in her first run, and one of her defining character traits is that Peter Parker can't help but jump her when he's around her.	[]
I like girlbosses (not irl), but the problem with western media is that being a girlboss=not showing any sign of feminity, being feminine is bad. Can't they have a soft, feminine side? Can't they open up and show some weaknesses like everyone else? Can they stop being misandrist?	[]
Barbie also worked because when you get women really interested, usually the husband or boyfriend will tag along. Not that he necessarily wants to see it, but because she wants to go with him, and well, you dont want to make her mad, so the guy tags along. Studio suddenly increased the ticket sales simply because the guy tags along. This was the strategy with romcoms in the 2000s. Why was it forgotten?	['Barbie also worked because of nostalgia. The Barbie doll was a cultural icon for girls for over a decade ... and the plot couldn‚Äôt run afoul of the Barbie story ... girls made up their own stories for their own dolls. The comic book superheroes tapped into that similar nostalgia for boys and was wildly successful ... as long as the plots were faithful to the source material.']

Or course women can play the dominant boss and some guys would like it and some guys can act like girly girls and some women might like it, but majority does not. So the freedom ist always there to display this, but people should know that the majority of opposide gender is not attracted to, if they behave like the wrong gender.	[]
Men and women will watch what they want. You can't change statistics. And that doesn't mean making action movies star exclusively male characters. We have characters like Ripley from alien, Laura Croft from Tomb Raider, and Linda Hamilton from Terminator. And a few others I personally couldn't recall off the top of my head because I don't watch many movies. All these female badasses who perfectly fit their role and aren't forcing themselves too much. Because the reality is, those are the kinds of women who would make it in those scenarios, not ones who throw their weight around and act like the sun shines out their backside.	[]

I feel like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, even Marvel and DC need to be put to rest at this point. They have been done to death and beyond.

Out of the females who buy tickets to superhero movies, I'd be interested to find out how many of them buy their ticket because their son, boyfriend, husband, father or some other male influence in their life is the one who actually wants to see the movie and asked them to go.	"[""Why does it matter tho? A ticket is a ticket. It's getting them money. People start exploring different genres for different reasons (including getting persuaded by their peers) and eventually start loving it. It's kind of similar to how most men don't watch romcoms but start getting into because of their female peers and start enjoying it."", ""It matters because understanding who is interested in their movies informs the studios to whom they should sell. The demographic for these movies, in terms of sex, has not significantly changed.  My point is that I bet the percentage of moviegoers who watch action and superhero movies is even more than 70% male.  Moreover, I bet most are non-feminist and non-woke, which begs the question: for whom are they making She-Hulk and The Marvels?  I'm just not seeing where the tens of millions of woke, feminist, superhero fans are hanging out.  The box office isn't, either."", 'Irrelevant.', ""It's definitely a valid component, as my husband is pretty much the only reason I watched. That said, I _did_ enjoy some of the earlier movies, but eventually, the same cinematic world being in constant peril got to be too exhausting for me. Once we hit parallel universes I stopped caring and pretended none of it ever happened, lol.\n\nI would note, though, that having heard good things online about Godzilla Minus One, I was excited to see it, and was definitely not disappointed. If every superhero movie had similarly compelling narratives, I probably wouldn't have to be dragged to the theater anymore.""]"

"Most mentally stable females do not identify with modern feminism. The internet has desperately tried to inject the idea that they do, but when reality is observed, they dont, which is why these trash bag movies do so poorly and flop. Simple mathematics.

Generally, the caste of females that do identify with these films are damaged, hurt, or otherwise victims of some sort of trauma whether self or externally inflicted. Another simple mathematical fact.

Also, the types of females that do revel in these abnormal types of films generally possess attributes of grandiose schizophrenics. A simple scientific fact."	[]

To the minds of the people fighting for movies aimed for women in traditionally male-dominated genres (you'll notice we aren't getting male-oriented movies from hollywood even though, ironically, japan has been pandering to men with some pretty appealing romance like kaguya-sama so go figure) it's not because women tend to plain not be interested in those genres, much like how some people just don't care to interact with certain genres a certain way (I, for one, love running fantasy ttrpgs and can enjoy the occasional fantasy CRPG but being a player in a fantasy world is like water to a cat for me), but it's because there aren't any good options for women, despite the fact that even movies who are good and do what they try to do get a majority male audience."

"It's fucking insane to make films for an audience that doesn't exist outside of social media. Like, 70% of the audience is men, and majority of those 30% that are female show up to watch those films with at least one dude with them, and the rest aren't a bunch of misandrists either. They tried to basically pander to a completely new audience, one that only exists on twitter, and massively failed as a result.

When they make these girlboss films, their audience is fucking nobody from the existing fanbase, because those women who already enjoyed marvel films don't want to watch films that actively shit on men at every opportunity. Just as an example, Loki is a way more popular character among the female audience than the male one. Probably a result as to why Loki, a show that shits on Loki, did so abhorrently poorly."	[]
"What is wrong with modern feminism? Just about everything. We see come to fruition the argument and dire warning that CS Lewis laid out over 50 years ago. If you abandon objective reason all that is left is instinct and appetite led by the emotional state of the day. Morality is relative, not objective  and hedonism and anarchy, from blindly following instinct and emotion, follow in due course. Chaos and inconsistency reigns as instinctual appetites change from week to week, even day to day. Long term planning goes out the window, subjected to short term whim. Truth and justice become arbitrary. The individual becomes listless and paralyzed and many feminists become bitter and hateful, as they can only blame others and not themselves for their misery. 
Modern feminists are dominated by envy for what they don't have which is whatever traits only men seem to have that they covet. And sadly, such women have bad judgement and covet the dominant dark triad traits of poor quality men. They also will promote such men where they find them over high quality men with good traits which they dismiss as weakness. 
In the real world the pattern of feminists is as follows: Men create a profession or other social construct (club, college degree, computer game industry, film genre, democratic system) and run it in a fair and orderly fashion. Women covet what men have built for themselves in society, barge in, commandeer it for themselves, ruin it and then abandon it. Men then leave and create a new social construct. Rinse and repeat.  
What happened to Marvel and Star Wars is just one of so many examples of how feminists behave. The worst part is that feminists seem to be natural proponents of socialist behavior. They want power for power's sake, then they abuse that power to turn whatever organization they took over into a narcissistic version of themselves with only a narrow appeal to a very few like minded individuals. They don't care what anyone else thinks nor do they care what it does to the brand and company. They will continue down this self-destructive path until the funds run out or they get kicked out."	[]

"It's like a leasbianization of women, all these women aren't feminine, they are masculine. It amazes me why this is not mentioned around, it is obvious, the ""woke"" is not about gender equality, it is about the rest of the genders, LGBTQetc genders popularization by imposition. This is a deeper and deeper problem, and the women are getting the worst part of it, they are erasing women characters and replacing them with homosexual female/trans characters, to show that a trans woman can also be a woman. And by this, they are erasing the real woman. 
There is no debating on what is a men, but there is on what constitutes a woman, the women bathroom now is the gender equality bathroom, why, just why is this insistence on harassing women so much? just let them be in peace."	[]

"Saying this as someone liberal and left-leaning... It truly baffles me how people don't get how we got to this point in the first place.

Right wings and conservatives have been making fun of humanities and arts for ages, saying it for fruity freeloader hippies, and sending their kids off to STEM.
As a result, arts truly did become a safe space, or a breeding ground for liberals, feminists, Marxists and so on, and people who get those degrees are the ones with such worldviews, usually skewed far to the left of the population average.
And when that happens, and when those people start taking all the major positions in the creative industry- of course they will tell their girlboss stories, because that's their idea of how the world should be.
You wanna fix that? Start by building more appreciation towards arts among the general populace.

I'm a woman who loves action and superhero stuff, but whatever the hell marvel is trying to do is not it!!! Rather than making me want to watch said movies made for a female audience, I started to stop watching marvel movies altogether... They're releasing trash after trash and the only female oriented one I did like was the Wanda vision show, but then they ruined everything about it in the doctor strange movie. On the other hand pure action movies that has no 'big' plots like John wick ended up being one of my favourite movies.... it's the shameless pandering they're trying to achieve by incorporating toxic masculinity, which no one likes, into women that is ruining all these movies...

I mean its true with my group of girlfriends were more interested in romance. And the only way i ever got into marvel (us girl saw it as scary or too gory for our comfort) Guardians of the galaxy had some level of romance in them when it came to ghamorroah and chris pratt. Thats WHEN I ACTUALLY started getting into marvel and realizing i liked it alot. My girlfriends are still uninterested. The struggles that men deal with are different from the strugggles woman deal with. Just reality. Our escape for woman is romance being protected the hope of finding love. Mens escape is fighting the world and nuclear explosions to offset difficulties they face. Just VERY differenr realities we live.	['This is a massive generalization.']

"To be fair it CAN be done.  If any writer needs direction on how to write an awesome female action lead...just watch the movie Alien. Ripley wasn't a ""girl boss"" ...she was a tough as stone astronaut battling a horrifying enemy that she was trapped on a ship with.  It wasn't an easy victory for her...exactly BECAUSE she wasn't as physically strong as her male counterparts.  She was smart, cunning...and survived based on sheer will, and instinct. She is easily tougher than any MCU hero by miles."	[]
"It‚Äôs also worth noting that the ‚Äúdiversity approach‚Äù is something studios will turn to when a franchise is already stale in an attempt to revitalize it. In other words, did The Marvels flop because of its ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù approach or because the MCU is oversaturated and on its way out? Is Madame Web bad because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù movie, or because Sony‚Äôs spider-man adjacent approach is desperate and exhausting? Kraven might be Venom, or it might be Morbius. People point to diversity as an issue in film success because it‚Äôs a loud detail but that doesn‚Äôt mean it tells the story.

If the 4th expendables movie was more female focused everyone would blame that for its failure. That movie just sucked because it‚Äôs a tired premise with tired actors."	[]

"Just find it funny that a good number of male-led superhero movies have failed big time--The Flash, Ant-Man, Green Lantern, the latest installments of Thor and Aquaman didn't get particularly good notices, Fantastic Four (one woman, three men) is considered one of the worst movies in history,  but did anybody say, ""Down with Boy Bosses!

In world where As You Like It, Emma, Pride and Prejudice and so on and so forth exist, why would I go watch a superhero film? I won't say what I think about them and the tastes of the viewers, but they just don't give me what I want while Jane Austen adaptations usually do. Edit: Why am I here? Well, girlboss isn't toxic only for your favourite genre. Imagine Camembert Knutsen Knuting her way through Pride and Prejudice! Elizabeth would go from a flawed (and immature) young woman to someone you wish spinsterhood on. 'Mr Darcy and his ten thousand pounds a year?

Western women, who follow each and every trend mirror those 'girl boss' characters to the point where they are difficult to sympathise with (in other words, they're bloody unpleasant and unmarriable).  If these tropes (intentionally or otherwise) have become approximate to reality, does this not make them easy for women to relate to?  Essentially the producers have programmed their audience.	['If you said any of this to someone in real life they‚Äôd lock you up in an asylum. Get help', 'One thing someone said(and I can see where they are coming from)that if a lot of these more recently female characters were real, a lot of people would make the effort to avoid talking and/or being around with them.']
I like badass female characters even when they have traditionally masculine traits, that's not the issue for me, the issue exactly as you say: the Mary Sue types that does everything effortlessly without having to overcome any real challenges and do not have any weaknesses or character faults to overcome. It's insanely boring and patronizing. As if we were unable to understand that women can be strong without making them infallible.	[]

I don't even think it's femininity injected into male-dominated media that's the problem.

Very true. Great video as always. Check out Cabrini. It‚Äôs a breath of fresh air and I think it‚Äôs actually what women want. As a man, I really like it too which was surprising.	[]

"This idea of feamle-lead movies being interesting for women is so bizarre. I get it in some slice of life or romantic comedies, but in something that is beyond the scope of interest of this stereotypical female audience there have to something that *is actually interesting to them*. If it's not the genre than maybe, I don't know, a hot male lead? How about that?
They're clearly not making those movies for people interested in superheroes, male or female, but refuse to make them interesting for anyone, really.

(I personally don't think everything should be for everyone but if you're doing something could you at least do it well?)"	[]
"I still think that two of the strongest female leads has been ""Mrs. Frisby"" from ""The Rats of NIMH"" and Ripley from ""Alien."" They are both characters that are scared to death of the opposition. They are the weaker player in the story with all the odds stacked up against them. Despite that, they still find the courage to fight back. Being a strong character isn't about becoming stronger to overtake the opposition. It's about acting strong when the character KNOWS they can't win but still continues to  fight anyway."	[]
Speaking of girl boss. Cabrini is a must see fyi	[]
Yeah, I wasn't a fan of Barbie either but you're right, it worked. I think the real girlboss here is Cabrini. She actually did something great for the world. She stood up when others wouldnt. Curious your take on it?	[]

I thought the marvels was absolutely dreadful. My fiance loves superhero movies, but hated it. One superhero movie that featured a woman which was done right was wonder wonan. It takes a woman, makes her kick-ass, but in a bad ass way. It also involves men who contribute heroism, valor, and some comedy. The second one wasnt as good, but the first was. If you want to make a woman a superhero, make her sexy, but still bad ass. You always keep your focus on your audience unless the audience youre aiming for isnt working much like stanley cups did recently.	[]
Hollywood is too stupid to realize the error.	[]
great superpowered female lead roles have existed for a long time, and sometimes in the same tv show even. just look at katara, toph and azula from the original avatar animated series. but nooooo we have the new age feminism now. every female character big and small must be as abnoxious as possible or the pink hair nose ring karen cartel will spray verbal diarrhea on us on twitter. must pander to their toxicity. right?

"Well said. I'd add that the ""death of the girlboss"" has also been accompanied by a massive drop in interest for superhero movies. The fact that Marvel and DC are flopping one after another while non-superhero movies like Barbie and Oppenheimer are taking front stage in popular culture brings me great joy."	[]
interesting thought i just brewed up in my head. if topgun mavrick had a girl boss as jon hamms character. would it change how much the movie brought in? that would have been a spot to completly change to a woman, and had the same dialog. i suspect the movie would have had the same outcome.	[]
The girl boss is dead, now. Maybe they'll quit trying to push every man being gay for another man. I understand that some men are gay but that is a very small minority	[]
"Of course, the producers have been assuming that the only reason women weren't into superhero films was because there weren't enough female superheroes. But I, for one, really wanted to see a Black Widow origin story after seeing her first Marvel appearance. Instead, the producers waited until she was middle-aged and they woke-wrapped it when it finally came out, making yet another film I shall never watch.

That's all Hollywood seems to do these days. So hate me if you want, while I just watch films I enjoy, including female-led films like The Last Goodbye and Terminator.The women prevailed without having to give up their femininity."	[]
"The more I watching what it is going on screen (both in cinematic and gaming platforms) the more I'm thinking about the actual things behind current narrative pushed there. IMHO, ""gender wars"" - let's call it that way - is not about female dominance to ""equalize"" male ""patriarchy"", or representation of ""alphabet"" minorities. It is about to grow up the true corporatively  suitable human beings which have only one purpose - to make profits; thus every single thing which can distract those pesky humans from doing that (like biological purpose of sex and following by corresponding social institutions, norms and traditions around) must be if not destroyed - then dismantled in a such way it could be monetized and exploitated for profits. Only fans, Tinder, gender surgery - the brightest, distilled examples of that. Currently, we are living in the world, where very little things in human life are left unmonetized, not turned into subscription service or not designed for making profits for corporations, which are failing to do something useful in return, piling up imaginable numbers of stocks prices and believing that's the only beneficial things of modern human civilization."

The biggest problem is that they are attracting female audiences by using female characters that comic books have established and made popular, and then changed them to better fit a narrative. People always liked captain marvel and madame web in the comics, but because they changed the character and their story, then they find the character less appealing and find it insulting they would do something like this to a fan favorite. People loved she-hulk and she was a character men and women alike could appreciate, then they made the show and changed her character and personality to be all about a narrative while also making fun of people who disliked the change, which further pushed people away from both sides	[]
Girl boss. Oxymoron.	[]
My problem with Barbie is while it did well, it still pushes gender politics and continues to feed into toxic feminism which only hurts the shrinking dynamic between men and women in the real world.  Dating and marriage is at rock bottom with many men choosing to either be single rather than put up with the bs that many western women bring to the table.  Divorce and child support laws also have men hesitant as regardless of the situation the woman has favor in the courts whether warranted or not based on the laws.  If like politics the left continues to dominate in the minds of women it will only prolong the inevitable unraveling and dying of western society or transforming into something far worse.	[]

Barbi played by a transgender would have been fun to watch!, i wonder why they didn't do that?	[]

but, but, aren't we perpetuating a patriarchal hierarchy if we don't make these 'statement' movies?   or...?	[]
Finally geez	[]
My mom is nearly militant in terms of her feminist view on life and she worked all of hers for the state government so she‚Äôs quite a smart cookie, but I tried to watch captain marvel with her but within 5 MINUTES she made me turn it off. When asked why she had no other reasons besides it‚Äôs bad and ‚Äúabsolute complete garbage‚Äù that should give you a hint the shit has gone too far. Keep in mind I love my mother very much and we have a great relationship, also we both loved Brie Larson seeing her as an absolutely delight and very cute in every thing she was in up to that point	[]
Yeeeeah I've never watched any of it anyway :)	[]
Excellent commentary with a lot of truth behind it.  The real question remains though as to whether the studios have the guts to face down the withering reviews of the woke media critics they will receive if/when they return to a formula that's desired.  The progressive machine behind these unpopular plots is still small in comparison to the general population.  Yet when they set their sites on a target they can do a lot of damage to a corporation, especially when they get their buddies in government involved in the process (which they nearly always do).  I honestly feel bad for these studios because they are basically screwed either way.  Make their core audiences happy again and revenues will go up, but the media mob will go nuts and suddenly tax breaks will disappear, odd FTC investigations will open up, etc. etc.  There really needs to be a cultural change back to the norm first if they are ever going to be very profitable again.

Someday these studios will run out of money and return to the old practice of making movies people want to see.	[]
The films and shows over the last 8 or so years have been awful. Bad writing, directing and acting is a perfect shitstorm. Hollywood has to re-engage a meritocracy. Hire the best people for the job, not some checkbox chancer with a room temperature IQ and an axe to grind. Disney will continue to haemorrhage money until they come to their senses.	[]
After I saw how bad Thor Love & Thunder was, I was pretty much done with most superhero movies because of the wokeness and the mentality of Hollywood not making movies for the right audiences, especially in the superhero genre demasculinizing men.  I'm down for a movie having a bad-ass and good looking female character like a Harley Quinn in suicide squad or a Black Widow in the Avengers movies or Wonder Woman, but you want to see them kick some ass while it being somewhat realistic that a more powerful character, often a male, occasionally gets the upper hand by being superiorly stronger or having a numbers game or maybe just outsmarting them.  Imagine in the romantic comedies for women if a man just humiliates and keeps the lead female down the entire movie and there is no redemption and the lead woman never goes to find a better partner and have a happy ending?  It's pretty similar	[]
Finally, so draining.	[]
In my opinion what this illustrates is a deep inferiority complex that these female movie makers and writers have.  They feel inferior to men so they will remedy that with on-screen fantasies where they are superior.  They would NEVER admit this, but I think that's what's really the motivation here.	[]
This is such a problem now. They don't know how to do a strong female character. You should watch Cabrini. I have heard good things and am curious about your thoughts.	[]

"At this point, I really don't believe that most of Hollywood and Disney employees actually care about money. I think film studios have been gradually overtaken with extreme-left-wing social justice warriors, who _truly believe_ that if audiences don't want to see ANOTHER movie about ""oppressed"" women rising up and spitting on men, then you have to FORCE more of it down their throats until they agree that those stories are the only important ones to tell. These social justice warriors _really believe_ that they HAVE to only tell stories about the evil nonexistent patriarchy and oppressed POCs, women, and queers, regardless of whether they make money. And if no one will listen, then they believe that it's their job to ""tear the system down"" -- aka, destroy the film industry from within. All because the wider world just wasn't interested in their silly narratives about how evil despicable white men still rule the world and we should hate them."	[]

The biggest flop of the female boss concept is that they constantly try to make these female leads flawless characters, giving them zero complexity and no room for growth. Captain marvel, she-hulk, and rey palpatine are the same person from the beginning of their appearances to the end.	"['agreed', 'Every female character is written like a Steven Seagal movie or One Punch Man. Those 2 things are interesting because they are not the norm; even then they lose their appeal after awhile. There is a reason the trope of a hero losing then coming back is so prevalent. Every now and then a Seagal or OPM throws a nice alternative into the mix, but you cant have every single character in every movie/TV show be like that.\n\nAnd every single female character is written that way. It would get tiring and old if every male character is written that way, too. And thats why most strong male characters are always overcoming and powering up over a movie and generally losing at some point before pulling themselves off the canvas.', 'The problem with growth is that when it is actually done for a good reason, it usually implies that the person in question had a need to grow beforehand. You cant really have a character that shows growth without first showing them being immature, AND actually suffering the consequences of it. But since modern hollywood doesnt dare to EVER show women facing consequences, they cant have that kind of character arc. They must already start at the finish line of the race, because showing them struggling to learn how to run is deemed offensive.', 'They tried to pretend that Rey needed to train at the start of her third movie, though.', 'its because male hero movies are more or less based on reality where it counts, making them relatable to men by showing the extreme struggles most men go through to succeed. these political activist writers can\'t acknowledge reality, they need to push their ""women are better than men"" agenda, and so they make things that require a lot of work and effort for men just come freely and easily to women, all the while the male characters will be so unrealistic and  unrelated to men (just bumbling privileged idiots who mess things up despite them being ""easy""), and EVERY struggle the mary sue character will run into is because of these inferior men.']"

"So glad someone pointed out these corporates not understanding their audience. Try to tear down the divide between genders all you like - it'll be there for centuries to come. Injecting male-centric appeals to a movie for females would have as bad an effect as the female-centric appeals we already have in our movies.

Imagine getting served a veggie burger with carrot fries, when it wasn't what you asked for. It wasn't what you were shown on the menu. The server says
""Well if you don't like it, sir, go somewhere else. We're not responsible for your bad taste. Go find another establishment. We only serve cultured customers.""

"The woke agenda failed because they tried to erase/blend the genders, which just doesn't work. The marketing and social media echo chambers might have made these ideas feel empowering, but at the end of the day money talks. You can't make plastic, overbearing female characters who portray the worst qualities of men and male characters who act like simps and babies and make people want to watch them because almost nobody has any interest in erasing gender values. This isn't ""female"" empowerment, it's female erasure. Just like it's male erasure. 

We already have classic action and scifi movies with compelling female leads: Ripley in the Alien franchise, Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise. You didn't need to erase their womanhood to make them cool. You didn't need to show these physically small women taking on huge men in hand-to-hand combat and winning. They were portrayed as kicking ass within their natural capacities and it was epic. Women generally aren't as physically strong as men, but so what. Galadriel in Lord of the Rings? She was perfectly feminine, but do you think anyone in Middle Earth wanted to mess with her? Nope. 

The way the woke crowd acts like they have reinvented 'strong female leads' is hilarious. Children, it's already been done before, and WAY better. Just stop already and take notes."	[]
I'm a female, and absolutely love fantasy books and movies like Lotr, and musicals, occassionally watch some superhero action, scifi etc. Not very interested in romance genera. I prefer ones with male heros, and I hate this new strong women trope, it's really unrealistic and stupid. Tinkerbell (white one) in fairy animation movies is a far better strong female character than all Marvel female superheroes.	[]

"I hate gender-focused art in general. I can watch movies with a female lead, female direction, female writers, woman-focused soundtrack, etc. It just have to not about this divisive crap with made-up women's issues. There's real women's issues, and then there's the issues women have been convinced by fake reddit stories that they are happening all the time. I can watch a movie about real woman's issues. I watch old stuff like Tolstoy's Anna Karina, and I can absolutely empathize and be enthralled with the story. I can not empathize with She-Hulk and her problems. I think 90% of Studio Ghilbli movies have a female lead, and they are (mostly) amazing. Because they are true adventure, true comedy, true drama, true cinema. They're not filmed struggle sessions with everything that they should care about being phoned in. 

Who's going to make the 'guyboss' movie, where the guy is amazing because he's got 'guy power' and everybody is surprised and on board with everything the guy believes in, including aliens, except for the evil girl, who represents women who disagree with the writer on Twitter? And its a reboot of a Female-driven book, series, or movie? What if we made a Charlie's Angels, but it's actually about a guy named 'Chuck Angels', it bears no resemblance to the original story?

It's the character that has to be written as a proper character. ""Woman"" is not a character, it's not writting and it's not interesting. Prolly that's why people don't watch movies where cardboard cutouts do some CGI for some time."	[]

"Wanna know why characters like Ellen Ripley, Sarah Conner and Jamie Lloyd worked? It wasn't because they were women but because they each had a properly written hero's journey.  You do this and it doesn't matter who is in the role of the hero because you just want to root for the hero.
A lot of female protagonists nowadays either don't have this journey altogether or they have the stepping stones but the writers muck up the delivery."	[]
"I think another problem is that these big companies think they‚Äôre too big to fail, and their audiences will change for them because they don‚Äôt have any other choices.
That‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs so satisfying when an independent movie/game, like Palworld most recently, gets big. It shows the Titans that there are other players who will do the things they themselves refuse to do."	['yeah people will just find those other choices just look at how the comic industry has been dying and the japanese manga market has been rising.']

"I fucking HATE how they've basically ruined possibly my favourite trope.
I fucking LOVE ""girl boss"" characters.
Women who don't take shit, stand up for themselves and are generally bad ass?
That's basically my kryponite. Xena and Buffy were two of my favourite shows FFS. My first crush was a character in a book... who was ALSO a ""female protagonist!"" (the worst witch. I had a classmate that vaguely looked like the illustrations. You'll never guess what my type became. And was the solidified by Christina Ricci in Addams Family)

The problem isn't strong women.
It's not powerful women.
It's not bossy women.
It's not independant women.
It's not even female dominated casts.

The problem is they're making shit.
A secondary problem is the manbashing, but honestly, if stuff is well written you can get away with that too!"	[]

Men watch superhero movie to be aspired by the superhero character, which I dont think putting a female as the main hero would aspire them..

I love movies from the 70s and 80s. Many movies back then wouldn't fly today, especially since people are used to modern special effects, picture quality. People are too fragile to misogyny, racism, history, comedy and so on... and so on. When people are faced with understanding the unknown, they more easily inherit an aggressive stance. Confusion is often discomforting. I still have faith in younger generations these days. People are still beautiful and enjoy the simple things in life, open to learning. Some...	[]

"as a guy, i think the marvels was a good movie. it was extremely short and that is something more people are not going to want to go pay for a movie ticket for. if it was less rushed out, i think they could have made more scenes to fill in where it felt rushed. that being said, marvel hasnt been pandering to any female audience so they cant expect a big showing.

barbie was about oppressed women too. so your theory doesn't make sense when barbie was a success."	[]
"I think the biggest misconception about the Barbie movie is that it is supposedly about feminism. It's just a classical coming of age movie: leaving your safe, a-sexual, childlike, ""make believe""-play-world  to explore male and female identity, overdue it a bit by launching into stereotypes, learning that getting hurt is part of the game and can be overcome and finally embrace adult life with the reward of sexuality you are now mature enough for."

Drinker is confused. On the one hand he does a whole video acknowledging the fact the whole masculinised women girl boss crap doesn't work...but then says they can still have 'plenty of kick ass female characters'. Fackin ell drinker...men don't want kick ass females in their movies. Women also don't want kick ass females in their movies. It is irrelevant if you make them 'more likeable', because it will still require both demographics to sit there and watch 8 stone women acting like men, whilst magically being able to go toe to toe in hand to hand combat with men, which people have just about had enough of. Women simply do not have the magnetism to lead an action movie. This is indisputably proven by the stream of flops we've seen, where the studios force this agenda down our throats, to no avail. So, you are way off the mark saying that studios 'don't need to radically alter' their approach. Yes they do. The 'kick ass' female soldier/warrior/superhero is dead - not that it was ever actually alive.	[]

All these ‚Äúgirl bosses‚Äù are ironically made by man haters.

They completely ignore the countless examples of well written female characters that men, more so than women even, love!	[]
While I entirely agree with this presentation.  Please don't start to fall down the Nerdrotic hole of gasping 'woke... WOOOOOOKE' in between barely held man tears. Your film reviews and generalised diatribes are delightful. HOWEVER, when content becomes centred around a perceived man v girl battle that really doesn't exist nor matter, things get tiresome. To be clear, almost no one on the platform is as far down the self hole of incel wah cry as Mr Nerdrotic but it's important to keep away form the edge.	[]
"It is amazing and concerning at the same time that the normal logic of business and profitability does not seem to apply in these cases. In a standard situation the aim is to sell and be sensitive to what your audience is looking for and then deliver.

Imagine going to your favorite restaurant and find out they turned vegan. And when you remark on that the staff will throw insults at you."	[]

"Here's the funniest part of it all: SciFi and Fantasy absolutely had a lot of female fans. Even Superhero movies had female fans, and quite a lot of them. And all of these old school female fans dislike these new movies just as much as the men do.

I'm a man and I am perfectly happy with a female lead - as long as the character is interesting, likeable and well written.

PS: As a matter of fact the Superhero genre is the one genre where it can make sense that a female character outperforms the male counterparts in combat because it is about the powerlevel of the superpowers, not the ""normal"" physical strength. But even regarding this the character still needs to be well written and interesting and there is no reason to belittle the male characters."	[]

As a woman. I love traditional action flicks. Top gun the original was one of my absolute faves when I was young and the new one was good too. I liked it because it had a masculine womanizing male lead and tons of action. I like media that's traditionally made for men. Call me a tomboy I guess. But I haven't seen anything good aside from top gun come out in a decade. I watch TV to be entertained, not to look in a mirror. I can stare at myself in the bathroom for free already I ain't paying money for a female protag that thinks like me. That's boring.	[]

I haven‚Äôt really watched a lot since the Star Wars movies with Rey, and I think the biggest problem with her was that she was already amazing. You can make a feminist action movie for men, look at Mad Max! However, when Hollywood makes a female dominated action movie the woman is already better than everyone and just needs to unlock her potential which doesn‚Äôt appeal to anybody.	[]
I hate all these feminine power movies. I rather watch women on 24Kitchen than to see them kicking and grinding in the cinema.	[]
That's BS. If the movie has good writing anything works. I can watch Aliens, Tomb Raider, and Atomic Blonde and not get tired of them. Girlboss movies work if the writing is good.	[]

"This kinda stuff and politics in general is what has driven me away from watching *_ANY_* movies *_WHATSOEVER!_* The only stuff I watch for entertainment is Youtube videos from people whom I agree with or who are politically neutral for the most part! And for some reason I've also all but stopped enjoying video games where I used to spend most of my free time playing them, and that includes games that I absolutely *_LOVED!_* I think that's been caused by all the stuff I heard about more and more utter piles of *_CRAP_* being released in the gaming industry aswell, tho so far I can't remember much of that being due to politics.

There's one good aspect to all of the above tho, namely that I make use of just about every minute of good weather for outdoor activities instead of watching movies or playing video games.

Still, sometimes I miss the good old days when there were movies that I loved so much that I tried to recreate stuff that was used in them, such as guns (which I try and rebuild as airsoft guns) or vehicles (which I try and rebuild as RC-vehicles), and the times when my friends and me enjoyed playing games like Battlefield together."

Comics always felt like when I used to play with my toys. These movies feel like when my parents forced me to play with my lil sis. She didnt like my stories, I didnt want to play her way. We had a miserable time. We had a better time when I'd be playing, and she just picked up a toy and joined. I really wish she even did that once, sadly it never happened. Also, i never just walked into her picnic game and had tea.	[]

"99% of movie goers just like the general public could care less about the woke hollywood adgendas, I recall my grand parents just as my parents and now my own relationship with my wife as being an equal partnership and mutual understanding.
This it seems is where the problems are with those Hollywood new age folks.
They are the ones who havent had equality within their careers and possibly personal lives, its always been the dirty old rapey white men that ran it like a pervy boys club and now the new age folk want to get their chance to prove they are...??....as good?
The problem is, they think everyone has been treated like they have and the truth is we havent, not for generations, I mean some have obviously as theres always a few bastards out there.

But the new hollywoke elite have an hatred for their former masters so strong that they are trying to change society and bend it into their twisted image of what they think society should be, strong 'individuals' that dont need any help from men, especially white ones.
This hatred is so strong that not only are they trying to bend society to their own twisted views via crap movies they are also trying to delete the history of these franchises. 
Sure we know these franchises were paid for by mysoganistic dirty old pedos, but they are beloved by many....the movies not the pedos that is.

So to try destroy them and delete them from history just to furthur your adgendas is a big No No that they zeems to be starting to understand.
The oddest thing is, the sci-fi genre already has the most equality and diversity of all already, surely they should be targeting romance movies or dramas?"	[]

But the writing is just bad.
Madam web is a story from a noname to a big bad ass girl in 5 min. No deep bounding. Just stupid action stuff for a character we never seen so far and know nothing about and not care about at all. Its just boring. Overlay it with woman ""problems"" and you have a film thats mostly boring for men thats correct.

Black widow worked very well and its a mostly female film. Female actors is not the problem

"A Sir Isaac Newton quote is rather perfect to kick things off on.

Also, Madame Web wasn't a woke film. Matter of fact, it was a superhero film with NO SUPERHEROES. I think that's even more egregious than it being full of identity politics. I bet you that's why the film flopped universally and Hollywood Reporter was as tough as it was.

Speaking of which, one of the stars, Sydney Sweeney, is beloved by universally everyone regardless of your political stance. Besides being a drop-dead gorgeous beauty, she's basically anti-Rachel Zegler. That could be why she's invited to so many award shows in spite of her fashion sense that doesn't scream ""WOKE!"". She's basically the new America's sweetheart now. And she would be wise to take advantage of it and campaign to be Power Girl in James Gunn's DCU.

Thought I'd bring all that up.

There is a cultic dogma to be pushed however.	[]
Bruce Banner is a genius, Hulk is a brute. Not much explanation needed when hulk picks up a bus and throws it across town, it looks like he can do it. Captain America was given a super soldier serum, attended basic training in the army, fought in WWII, and we can assume he continued training while at SHIELD. Black Widow was trained as an assassin from pre-teen. There is no reason why Kamala Khan can fight. Her powers do not imbue her with agility or strength or keen awareness. This is why many of these recent characterizations suck. (I still love her character though, good vibes and charisma off the charts . Best part of The Marvels) The problem is, nobody believes these women can do what they have them doing. I mean, come on, Stallone and Schwarzenegger looked like they can kick some @$$. Name an action hero from the 80's and they either just plain looked like they could do it, or it was thoroughly explained. Wack plots and crappy dialogue don't help either. But if they want more women looking like a boss in their movies, they are hiring the wrong people. They need to go watch Haywire.	[]
I know this will sound CRAZY but maybe the majority of women in this country don't hate men the way feminists do.	[]
Its more just pandering.  Like fr though, why didnt they just use silk? The already established spiderwoman. Ffs these people are stupid. But the worst thing is that, the female leads these days are all unbearable or mary sues.	[]
I will never go to a movie where a man is shown as constantly aroused and wanting to rape a woman, where a woman is always smart and gets it right the first time and a man is always stupid and subordinate to a woman, this is not equality, this is clearly biased towards women, I think so not interesting, love in films is dead, where kisses, romantic encounters and stories of men and women, everything is dead, I don‚Äôt want any more new crap and don‚Äôt recommend it to anyone!	[]
I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons I love Ghibli films so much. The lead characters are mostly female, but they have weaknesses with their strengths and you have male counterparts that also have weaknesses and strengths. But they come together and help and support one another. It‚Äôs not competitive.	"['This. While both sexes often don\'t understand each other, in the end we\'re just two sides of the same coin. Doesn\'t mean we have the same (dis)likes and want to be the same. There\'s no ""unisex"" human being, a ""one size fits it all"".', 'Ghibli films are peak', 'Cool, like the Sequel Trilogy then!\nAnd personally, not too much of a fan Ghibli movies(My Neighbor Totoro is peak fiction though, very wholesome movie).', 'We need to talk about Ghibli movies more!!! \nThey are the best!!', ""They often end up being foils, and the gender on each side isn't always the same either.""]"

The funny thing, though, is that women like good movies and characters like men. It's why they watch and love movies that men also tend to flock to. There are many good movies, novels, and anime/Manhwa that have female led casts and characters, but the reason they're successful is because they don't do what Disney does, and actually make believable female characters XD.

"['Idk why you stop at civil. There‚Äôs still endgame Infinity war. And a lot of single movies that are still good. Just don‚Äôt pick shit movies you aren‚Äôt gonna watch', '@@Pugerino I\'m in the minority who absolutely HATED 80% of Endgame. So many of the problems people complain about in the MCU are in that movie. Bloated plot. Endless ""jokes"". Lack of seriousness. Total pandering and nostalgia bait. Fat Thor. Tony\'s Dad. Capt back in time. The end of the movie is a fight with a version of Thanos that we just met.

"I've never understood why they've never tried for a Marvel Musical Movie to capture the female demographic. Go full Bollywood with it. If they hadn't messed up She-Hulk so much, that character's innate winky-winky fourth wall breaking would have been PERFECT for a 90 minute musical comedy based around being a female lawyer who happens to have super-strength.

Or Captain Marvel... a fish out of water romantic comedy in which she come to Earth as a hardnosed soldier but slowly warms up to the humans around her. Basically the first Thor movie with dance numbers and a Greek Chorus."	[]
I'm glad I grew up in the 90s and early 00s. Movies and shows back then was not constantly injecting politics in them. If they were, it was subtle enough that it wasn't made focus of the movie. I also miss the time when super hero movies were just about heroes and story, not agendas. Remember how good Xmen and Spiderman was? The height of super hero movies was the 2012 Avengers. Marvel figured out the formula on making amazing super hero movies. Now they started injecting bs agendas that just ruined everything.	[]
Your editorial style has evolved. By counterpointing Barbie and Maverick and (at a bigger scale the differences between appetites of the two demographics) this comes across as way more nuanced than your earlier stuff. Good work.

don't the madame web numbers kinda mean they massively succeded in their goal? going from a 30% to 49% female audience is pretty fucking insane, it's like a 60% increase. but yeah I don't think they are happy to loose that much overall viewership for it	[]

"But some people in the industry dont care who the public is. The public HAS to accept their agenda, because they gonna push it anyway.

"Some of this is because of streaming and the need to grow revenue in a way which keeps shareholders happy. If you have saturated your market for your usual product then the ""obvious"" answer is to appeal to a new market. But they havent done this with new IPs or original stories. Instead they haveused IPs which, lets be honest, are nearing the end of their cycles. So you try and shoe horn in a story, create new characters to replace the old, and generally pander to your desired audience. But you do this with inexperienced writers and rush the production so that bad CGI and expensive reshoots are almost obligatory. No wonder these films fail."	[]

No one learned the (what I thought was extremely obvious) lesson from the all woman ghostbusters remake:  turning men into simping fools in your entertainment media completely alienates at least 50% of your audience (male), and only the ones dumb enough to stick around will be dumb enough to keep lapping it up.  I don't want to pay any amount of money as a male to be told how stupid my gender is to feed the fragile ego of feminist chauvinists.	[]

"Brother I think you‚Äôre missing something here. In Sony‚Äôs case- the most valuable thing is the IP itself. They HAVE to put out a movie/use the IP to re-up the license. 

So your mistake here is taking something like madame webb in good faith. But this is 3D chess. You‚Äôve gotta think a little bigger here. The studio doesn‚Äôt care about madame webb or any of these movies. Especially Sony. They‚Äôre not cobbling together a crack team hoping to push a product with some agenda and win everyone over with their top tier filmmaking. 

They don‚Äôt give a shit. They check when their licenses are expiring. Roll over. Squeeze out a lowest possible budget for the material. Half heartedly assemble a team of meh writers and meh directors and throw a decent size bag of money at whatever A to B level actor they can coax into taking the career hit to be the face of a piece of shit. 

They don‚Äôt care about the reviews. They don‚Äôt even really care if you see it. the LICENSE is more valuable than the movie. 

So you‚Äôre already walking around with egg on your face by criticizing the film as if anyone made it with more than negligible effort. As if you‚Äôre really stopping the presses by discovering it‚Äôs bad. 


They know it‚Äôs bad. They don‚Äôt care."	[]

It's like buyers remorse but knowing you'd hate the end product and then complaining it exists.

The Marvels was terrible.  I have not seen Madame Web... maybe when it streams?  To make a film to force a race, gender or sexual orientation agenda is a HUGE mistake if you want to be successful.  Studios want people to go back to the theater... the problem is that it's not worth the risk if a movie will be good or not.  I feel less ill if I see a poorish movie streaming... when streaming if something sucks, I just stop it and go to something else until I find something I or my family likes.	['What was the agenda?', '@@AspieOperator To push policies that go against what the majority thinks and wants.']
"The irony is that people actually believe that Hollywood invests HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of dollars for the sake of YOUR entertainment. (Please take time to ponder that)

I dont know about you but if i didnt break even on a hundred million dollar investment, (dumb as i am) I'd learn quick and NEVER make that mistake again. Because logically, that makes NO sense UNLESS making A profit wasnt your primary goal. 

I know, the quickest gratification, when seeing an expensive movie flop is to point a finger and laugh because it has all the characteristics of a failure. How they missed their target audience. How the audience could have produced a better film. Etc. but hear me out. 

Now, i dont obsess over this because i stand firm in my own beliefs (as should you) so feel free to respond to my comment as you wish. My purpose is to simply offer your mind a different perspective.

With that being said, what i see when i watch HOLLYWOOD films is an attempt at a subtle cultural assimilation. Hollywood is a billion dollar investment to subtly place ideas into your mind through Entertainment. (Think of the movie Inception) but it's real.

The films mentioned in this video all push overt cultural themes and its laughable because we recognize what they are trying to do and rather than conform to their ideas we mock it.  (But continued exposure to Agendas over long periods of time have proven to change massive cultural belief.)

Its easy to recognize an agenda when its overt. But i believe even the most entertaining Hollywood films that we praise also have underlying agendas too and perhaps we've come to embrace their ideology without even knowing it simply because ""that film was so well made.""

If you can hear what im saying, it's ok to watch movies. But watch them with your mentality on guard. Your values on guard. Your morals on guard. Even if the movie is the best movie you've ever seen, you're exposing your mind to someone else's motives.

Make a conscious effort daily to Stand Guard at the Door of Your Mind. Because a corrupt mentality can be irreparable."	[]
This is why I hope a KaZar series is never made. It'll just be a 2-hour soapbox about white saviordom, colonialism and cultural appropriation.

Great video I wonder why executives disregard hard core fans of anything anymore??? That‚Äôs originally how fan bases became what they are. A company realizes people like their product or project and continue to cater towards the positive reactions. Now that‚Äôs seemingly unheard of in modern times. Star wars hasn‚Äôt had anything for a core fan for a while and so has marvel. If u really resonated with the movies right after iron man 2 or anything up to the prequels in Star Wars I believe your a core fan and none have been born since those early times. That‚Äôs the metric they need to follow is core fans and the consistency that comes from that, then build upon it, not the other way around. No one can force people to casually view media and expect growth. However, you can cause a hardcore fan no choice but to see the new project that‚Äôs from a universe they love, that‚Äôs easy and already proven to work monetarily.	[]

I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with the ‚ÄúGirlBoss‚Äù I think that it‚Äôs just a writing problem. I remember when legend of Korra came out and tons of ppl sh-tted on her character and kept comparing her to Aang. But there was nothing wrong with her character. Her character started out as this Arrogant and annoying character, thought she could take on the world with her fist and the phenomenal writers for that show didn‚Äôt let her get away with shit. She constantly fell on her face, failing time and time again, she had to learn patience, she had to learn that everything you do there will always be consequences, doesn‚Äôt matter how strong and powerful you think you are there is always someone bigger, stronger, smarter. The writers wrote her to be an antithesis of Aang and to this day Ppl hate her for it. I don‚Äôt care about Female characters back in the 90s or early 2000s in todays era at this point I think ppl are just d‚Äîkriding and it‚Äôs cool  to just jump on the bandwagon to hate All ‚ÄúGirlBoss‚Äù characters doesn‚Äôt matter how they are written	[]

Hollywood wasn't 'chasing an audience that didn't exist', they were literally trying to twist perceptions to make our society match their sick feminized movies. That's how Socialism works.

"4:49 it's not that women don't connect to these superheroes because they represent ""masculine ideals"", it's because girlboss characters have no character arc.

 They're not allowed to have flaws or make mistakes by the script so they start out ""perfect"" and end exactly in the same place. It's a Hero's Journey, except you miss a critical part of the journey. And because it's such a shallow way of pandering to a female audience,  you can easily see through it.

A movie that doesn't fall into this trap is Everything ,everywhere, all at once where Evelyn, the main character and pseudo superhero, is allowed to be flawed and makes embarrassing mistakes. And so  she is actually interesting and enjoyable to watch, despite her also kicking a lot of ass in the last act. It feels earned because she had to learn and overcome her mistakes."	['I miss genuine vulnerable female characters who are able to see men as their equals, and not oppressors. - female.']
bruh, you're completely wrong about barbie. that movie ended up resonating with men more than women solely because of ken. he's just a lost male in a girl-boss pandering society, trying to find his masculinity in a place that won't allow him to. that remind anyone of anything? ü§£	[]

"""males make up 60-70% of the audience""

"It is very funny how he describes what It means, from the studio's perspective, to make a film that is supposed to appeal to women. I thought it was just a pandering thing and it had to do with politics. not really as much about gender, but either way they seem to think that an actual statistically effective way to get women to see something is to just put women in it. 

so obviously that opinion is informed not by relevant data at all. it's informed by like Disney princess movie data, at best, and then just the political opinions of people in the film industry which is obviously going to excuse super third wave, super left, basically identitary in narcissists who will not see something if a person who looks just like them isn't in it

"It ain't about ""female power"" or ""strong female lead characters"" or even ""what race are they?"" - and that's what most people don't understand.

The NEW generations want politically correct, politically charged bullshit and are okay with making drastic changes and deviations from established characters and stories in order to fuel a weird power fantasy.

The CORE nerds who just want to watch a damn movie don't care about that shit, we just don't want our stories that we invested time and money into to turn into garbage because of some politically correct nonsense.

Example: Black Panther 2 had the worst female leads I've seen in a movie since Prey. They offered and contributed nothing to the franchise/story, they looked around with bug eyed wonder, they were impulsive, stupid, narcissistic assholes and we're supposed to connect with that? Fuck that, give me the original Black Panther back. You want strong characters for everyone? Go watch Predator 2, Alien or Aliens, Terminator 1/2 , plenty of strong female leads, extras and co-stars that men and women of all races adored. True Lies had a good female lead, Long Kiss Goodnight had a great female lead, but nope, can't have cool shit anymore.

Now it's all about ""how can we shit on the male audience and make women feel super cool by including weird political statements and racial stereotypes into each character that if you call out as bullshit you'll be labeled sexist or racist for, while attracting an all female audience"" - you can't - you get psychotic ""Mary Sue"" styles who love it because - ""no consequences are great!"" - and the actual female nerds are fucking put off.

All nerds of all genders avoided this shit because they didn't want it. Men, women, transgender, no one wanted to put up with the new age nonsense, it's geared towards brain rot mother fuckers."	[]

Most of the women who go to theatres to superhero movies are mostly moms taking they're kids or going with they're boyfriend.	[]

Hollywood is just 5-10 years behind public discourse, I thought we all understood this. It is at least another year before we start seeing a mix of relevant things to 2015-2019 including the pushback on harmful feminist ideology.	[]
"Just gonna put this here: I wanna remind everyone that Women are not the problem. The problem is shareholders and executives that only greenlight the safest, most politically correct movies and shows while rushing the teams making them to reach unobtainable deadlines. Think about some of your favourite movies, were they safe and policically correct all the time? No, a good story can make a viewer uncomfortable, conflicted, and wanting to keep watching. Unpolitically correct character can either create a dynamic antagonist or give protagonists room to grow in a natural way that isn't a ""power up"". I mean just look at Tony Stark for example, he was interesting because we got to watch a rich, alcoholic, playboy, womanizer, turn into a: philathopist, hero, husband, and father."	[]
It's not about money. They can afford the flops. It's about social reengineering.	[]
"And then they blame it on ""sexism"" when they don't appeal to their fan base and the people that it's ""for"" don't even participate. 

It's like the women that complain about female athletes not getting paid the same as men, when those people that complain don't even watch those teams. 

Just another example of women expecting men to do all the work and claiming sexism when they don't."	[]
"Great job Drinker!  I always love your videos.  Now the issue is - How are we going to get our movies back?  The studios have pushed the pendulum so far with ‚ÄúThe Message‚Äù that they think they‚Äôll only have to swing back a little bit to get the audience to come back.  Even if they ease up with these over-the-top in-your-face girl bosses (to try to get the male audience back) they‚Äôll still inject the message in subtle annoying ways because they‚Äôll think they can get away with it, as long as they tone down what they‚Äôve been doing.  Tom Green said, about the movie he made, that they put sooooo much over-the-top raunchy disgusting stuff in it, that they knew the censors would cut, for the sole purpose of ensuring the censors would leave the slightly less raunchy disgusting stuff that the makers really wanted in the film.  He knew the censors would have cut the less disgusting vile content if he hadn‚Äôt put the MORE disgusting vile stuff.  He pushed way too far so he wouldn‚Äôt have to come back as much.

That‚Äôs what these studios are doing.  They‚Äôll tone down the message a little, thinking it‚Äôll bring bake the audience, but it‚Äôll still be there.  Just as ridiculous, annoying, and story breaking as ever, just maybe less noticeable.  I say we can‚Äôt let them get away with it.  To me Disney is dead.  And they killed Marvel and Star Wars.  And not only them but all of these writers and creators who sacrifice good stories and characters to try to ‚Äúfix the problem‚Äù of men and women being different, or having male fans expect the kind of stories and characters that made them fans in the first place. 

I have not seen anything with Carol Danvers in it (except End Game).  I have not seen The Last Skywalker.  I haven‚Äôt seen anything that Amazon makes.  Unfortunately I have to assume that everything made these days is filled with woke messages that would make physically ill, and I only see things that I know are a sure thing.  I know it‚Äôs sad but I can‚Äôt keep giving my money to these types of people and supporting this garbage, even if they start making it less stinky. I‚Äôve been done with these people for a long time and I think we should all be done with them.  They‚Äôve done too much harm to characters and stories I grew up with and cared deeply about to ever get me back."	[]
Asoka was amazing	[]
I keep saying that Marvel dropped the ball BIGTIME not doing a Hella origin movie sometime after her debut. The actress in Thor Ragnarok was fantastic, menacing, believable and gorgeous. It actually made sense but they‚Äôre too busy trying to diversify their movies they didn‚Äôt see this obvious one.	[]
"Do you think Hollywood Studios don't know these. Before greenlighting a project, market analysis report is the first thing they get. But the decision makers in Hollywood think they have moral superiority and they're trying to change the market.
In their mind they're probably fighting a holy feminist war and think that in 5-10 years, audience will gradually adapt to these movies and tv series."	[]
This happens because women literally cry about being in spaces that they don‚Äôt care about being in all for the sake of ‚Äú inclusion‚Äù	[]

Me and my fried went to go see Madame Web just see how bad it truly was we were laughing our asses off the whole movie, not because the movie was trying to make us laugh but we were laughing at how bad it was.	[]
Every writing team in hollywood should watch Arcane to see how to write a good female lead (Vi) who's also an actual likeable human being.	[]
"Pandering ""against sexism"" has given us the worst, most watered down version of Katara to make her a pallatable, corporate girlboss where she was a triumph of maternal power, feminine rage, and endless compassion."	[]
While i agree with whats said, the Way the Narrator talks and his Pronunciation is really annoying.	[]
They don't watch much female sports either. üòÇ	[]
The thing is men don‚Äôt really mind strong female leads. Most men love watching strong attractive women kick ass. It‚Äôs the underlying stories that are written to marginalize or belittle men while glorifying women that are the problem for genres that rely on men to buy them. The idea that women can do everything better than men is clearly a female idea, but most men simply don‚Äôt like or agree with that shit so they tune out.	[]
Ashoka is not a flop bruh	['Yes it was.  They mad profit because of the people that own disney plus.  But the whole series was pretty bad.  It was my last chance at Star Wars, but im done.  Every last star wars show was bad except andor and mandolorian season 1.']
To quote the most underrated Sci-Fi show ever 'This has all happened before, and it will all happen again'.  In the 60s that eras version of political correctness, which was much more right wing, destroyed movie returns.  Just like now a new medium, TV, was seriously starting to threaten Hollywood.  So in the 70s the studio execs decided to swing for the fences.  Major studios as well as small boutique shops all went a different direction trying to solve the problem.  This approach created Tarantino's much loved 70s film making.  I think once studios acknowledge and accept the Panderstone is dead, they'll all start taking chances in a million directions.  Which for us means great movies.	[]
They should make RomComs for men, where the men are average-looking betas who get laid left and right and eventually fall in love with total hotties	[]

I really hope it's the end of the girl boss era... It completely destroyed and entire generation of women who are now alone and starting to wake up to the reality that nobody want them.	[]
Here's the thing, as a woman I'm not going to automatically turn up for a movie where the protagonists are women. It takes more than that for them to be relatable. I'm not going to see myself in a woman character if...being a woman is her overarching character trait. I don't want filmmakers to tell me who I relate to based on this one characteristic that I had no control over. I want characters with nuance, with backstory, with real struggles and arcs where they learn who they are and what makes them strong enough to face what's in their way.	[]

The ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù should have never existed. I‚Äôm not saying girls can‚Äôt be Maria Hill or Natasha Romanov style supporting actors but- The Marvels? a) following a movie with only female supes is a total bore b) their girl villain was the most washed out watered down ‚Äúback to phase 1‚Äù threat out here. Then we were hit with Madam Webb too and wow was that the biggest waste of money. It‚Äôs almost like the women at marvel/sony said ‚Äúit seems like everyone LOVED that girl power moment in end game. Let‚Äôs bring that back. If it ain‚Äôt a romantic comedy, girls are supporting actors at best.	['Girls can be leading heros. They just need to be written well.']
They forgot 90% of the audiences were men and women heroes don't do the trick	[]
"I think of them as ""chick flix"". 

I love watching those shows because Im a woman. Mostly shows like ""the Good Girls"" and ""The marvels"" was very entertaining with the swaps, cat vomit escape, and the planet of singing people. 

Sometimes I dont like it if it is ""one - dimensional"" stoic women- bad writing that is not relatable like in the first Captian Marvel movie, star wars ""Rey"", or even Alice in the Resident Evil series. 

Then the Dr. Who Jodie Whitaker took a bad hit without Stephen Moffett writing. It could have been great like when Missy became the master... But terrible writing made it hard to get interest in. 

I usually argue about bad writing was bad with the first ghostbusters all female reboot. Trying too hard thinking SNL comedians made it great the first time with men.  Its entertaining but not memorable or epic as the original.

The second reboot has better writing based on situational humor and having a gen z girl as a lead protagonist."	[]

The one thing that would have helped Madame Web would have been if Sony had put characters in the film comic fans knew about. Had the film been about a Margot Robbie-played Gwenpool, for instance, I think it would have sold better. Apart from Madame Web, I was not too familiar with the characters of the film; and I have no real idea who the Spider-Man‚Äîesque character is even after reading about him. I haven‚Äôt watched the movie‚Äîprobably will though‚Äîbut this is what I got from the trailers.	[]

Why do feminists think that women only want to watch a gaggle of other women?	[]
"Disney pretty much thought that they ""locked in"" the male audience with their past successes that all they have to do is to cater to the remaining audience which is the female demographic. If they pull this off, it'd be double the money! But it didn't cross their mind that by doing so, they would alienate the former fanbase and only draw a very VERY small smidgen of angry feminists to watch their shows. They're so up their asses that they fail to respect the very audience that propped them up in the first place."	[]
I haven't been to a movie in 5 years, don't like the female leads. Won't be back.	[]

I'm tired of sexism being shouted up and down the streets for everything when it's the exact opposite. Women's sports suffer because women don't watch women's sports. Women's superhero movies don't work because women don't go to see them. I know ten different men, myself included, that got their girlfriend to go see Infinite War and Endgame with them. I don't know a single girl who got their boyfriend or husband to come see Madame Web with them. It's just a simple matter of interest. I love a good female lead in a GOOD movie. Annihilation, alien, alien 2, prey, Everything Everywhere all at Once, Arrival... I could go on. I just don't want a shitty movie with shitty writing to label us sexist because we don't eat the shitty slop they put in front of us.	[]

Where's the romantic movies where the leading romantic interest is a man? Ah right. Nobody cares what men think and if he wants to tease a chase, she'll just respond to any of the other hundreds of people blowing up her phone. Also the audience would still be primarily women. It's kind of like we want equal representation for genders in high salaries, but nobody has a particular itch for gender representation among homeless. Far be it for me to deny anybody their dues, but prestige isn't handed-out at communist slumber parties. It's earned and that will never change. You want it. Take it from everyone else. That is all.

I guess this is why we need a more gender diverse team of storytellers in the entertainment industry. Diversity at the box office. It takes women who hate superhero movies, making a superhero movie with all women actors, to fulfill the needs of the female audience for superhero movies... even if that audience doesn't exist, and even if  women who actually do like superhero movies tend to like non-shit ones, anyway. The birth of the guaranteed flop is tied closely to the new ESG BS, BTW.	[]
Birds of prey was the first sign, then Ghostbusters ATC was another, Ocean's 8 another one...yet for some reason we're getting a Fast and Furious Spinoff...Hollywood will never learn.	[]
Regarding the so called 'girl boss' hype, I hope it dies. I blame the woke cult and their forcing it on everyone else. I miss good female characters in shows or movies. I am a woman and the good shows and movies in the last 10 years have been small and far in between. If the female character is well written then it adds to the movie. If you have people who are writing stories that have not been hired because they can write well, but because the studio can tick a box you are going to continue to get flops.	[]
Only thing I disagree is the concept the girl boss is dead. Until hollyweird and msm is purged of woke ideology, girl boss will remain. Id bet on it.	[]

"Just Another tactic in the ""women empowerment"" movement that's leading absolutely nowhere good for anyone.  For the record I'm not saying all movies with a female lead are propaganda and thus trash.  However most of the ones coming out now have unrelatable, bland characters who's entire being is ""I'm woman"" or ""I'm gay"" just to push a narrative.  There's hardly ever any meaningful development that happens for them, and they skip by every challenge easily with fort knox level plot armor from bad writing.

I dunno who I think is worse.  The people writing this schmutt in the first place to push their ideologies.  Or the ignorant people eating it up because it supports the ideology they've been brainwashed by.  Probably worse yet, the people that originally took over well meaning movements, like Feminism, BLM, and LGB, which started as 'please leave us alone / respect us as people' movements and turned into an agree with everything we say, or else movement.  None of them deserve an ounce of respect or support anymore based on current behavior.  The original ideas they were founded on do, but what they've degenerated into deserves to be destroyed entirely."	[]

The genre itself is not attractive to the majority of the male audience and making a movie about it will most likely not make a profit.

When a woman becomes significantly more successful than the other women around her, the other women work to bring her down.

I like to look at Korra from The Legend of Korra as a great way to do a strong, likeable, female lead. She was independent and head strong but also distinctly still a young woman with feminine qualities. She also had genuine character growth as she changed and improved, she wasn't perfect from the beginning. She had male supporting characters that weren't ever shoved to the side or shown up by her, in fact one of the very first side stories of the show is how there is a love triangle between them. Korra was a great example of a female lead that didn't abandon femininity but also had masculine or dominant qualities.	[]

"Superhero and action movies have inherently masculine values, but that doesn't mean women won't enjoy them. Masculine and feminine values can overlap, men can like feminine things and women can like masculine things. Like you say they don't NEED to pander to women to attract a female audience, they already have the female audience they will attract, targeting a more ""feminine"" female audience will only push that audience away while, as we've seen, will fail to attract the target audience."

As a dude there‚Äôs nothing more that I want for women to have genuinely strong female protagonists to look up to - when the strength of the character is backed up by a setting and plot that gel with the character‚Äôs premise, then the inspiration that women would derive from such characters would be what the whole girlboss movement strove for in the first place.

"Quite honestly, I don't think this is a men vs women problem. I think it's just a shitty movie problem.
Aquaman 2, Shazam 2, Antman 3, The Marvels, Madam Web, The Flash, they all sucked. Both male and female written. Comic book movies just aren't up to par, in fact, I feel fairly certain they're using AI to write most of the scripts.
The first wonder woman movie was female led and female directed. It wasn't my favorite but it did well in the box office and it wasn't complete garbage. Thor 2, Iron man 2 and 3, Spiderman 2, Captain America 1, Batman vs superman, Suicide squad,  Shang Chi, they were all shit too and they were male led, male directed movies. 
I don't think men or women would have a problem watching a female led, female written movie if it was just made well. Movies just aren't made well anymore. It's not a men vs women thing."	[]
"I grew up watching all the action stars in the movies of the late 80s-90s, watched BTaS and STaS, Xmen, Power Rangers etc....they motivated me to get into sports, weightlifting and human nature, psychology and philosophy, pretty much everything that could make you to be a better man.

What I saw over the last 5-10 years was disgusting business practices and don't feel one ounce of sadness for the money these companies have lost.  It's one thing to aim for a demographic, but it's another to degrade and villainize one.

LoTR and Star Wars were it for me; how do you ruin the PERFECT opportunity to reunite Luke, Han and Leia?  We'll NEVER have that chance again.  I feel bad for our parent's generation that grew up loving that franchise.  I honestly don't know if if I could forgive Disney for that, for buying into and pushing sexism and identity politics."	[]
The girl boss movies don't appeal to women because they just cast a woman in stead of a man. It's a male character in a female body. There is zero attention payed to creating an original character and showing an actual woman's perspective. It's doing nothing to empower women and or make them interested in things. It's not pandering, it's underestimating. We are not stupid to watch something so shitty.	['Well they do change one thing: remove flaw.

Let's be honest here. Firstly, preference is really based on individual not gender. Secondly, the movie madame web wasn't that as bad as the media portrayed it to be. I have watched the movie without any expectation and it was pretty good. It was something different from the generic Spiderman movie, a twist to the series. The young characters really did act like a teenager and the adult did act like one too. People aren't going to like what I'm about to say but super hero movies aren't for adults, male or female. The target audience has always been the kids. That is why people find movies like this sucks. I have watched every movie that came out and they were mid. The jokes were simply forced and lame, it's more like a kid's humour. Male or female, maybe ya'll should stop watching a kid's movie if you're expecting something grand.	[]

The sad thing is that even if they start to right the ship, many people have already mentally checked out of the old franchises they ruined. I've personally gotten to the point where I'll only really watch a movie in cinemas if I've gotten to see the previous one for free and liked it. The trust in getting an enjoyable experience really isn't there anymore.	"[""True...\nI was a hardcore movie fan and would even watch a _meh_ movie just for the cinematic experience...\nNow I get that experience on platforms like Netflix when I watch a movie blind without seeing the trailer especially for European or Korean made movies as the stories are captivating... US made TV shows still have magic but big budget movies, I don't even bother to watch the reviews in many cases... It took a lot to kill my enthusiasm...\nEven with pirate copies available for download... Movies like *Bloodshot* are available on Netflix but I will gladly rewatch Gladiator or Black Hawk Down for a tenth time.""]"
Funny thing that this all (not only those two Marvel flops but wokeness in general) reflects an old leftist myth that postulates that all entertainment is a capitalist imposition to create alienation, that is, the popular tastes aren't inherent to the populace but rather engineered by capitalism. Thus, if you seize power, you can just give the masses any entertainment you want -- for instance, woke pamphleteering -- that they'll enjoy. Well... This leftist myth has been proved to be bogus by the woke social engineering experiment.	[]

"I was raised by a single mom. She suffered from awful rheumatoid arthritis which had her in constant pain, unable to walk sometimes, and left her with severely crippled hands. We survived on pathetic disability checks and lived in a horrible part of town in one of the worst cities in America. She loved reading and wanted to be a writer. When I was a teen she started taking some classes at a local vocational college where courses were less than $100. There she discovered the hard sciences and no longer wanted to be a writer; she wanted to be an engineer. She worked her ass off and ultimately graduated with honors in nuclear engineering at a respected university and promptly started working as an intern at one of the country‚Äôs premier energy and defense laboratories. Many years and several additional degrees later she is now the director of research and development. She has ridden in tanks, worked on experimental reactors, oversaw safety for all nuclear operations, and is adored by her staff who she is 100% devoted to. She even recently had a stroke and I shit you not when she was laying on the hospital bed at the ER and couldn‚Äôt move her arm or leg her biggest concern was that she was in the process of giving one of her staff a promotion and she wasn‚Äôt able to complete the paperwork due to being in the hospital. Within several days she was up and shuffling around with a walker. Before the week was out she was sitting in a chair in her hospital room, refusing to lay in bed, and eager to leave so she could get on with her life and get back to work.

My mom is the strongest woman I know. When I see these clich√©d superwomen movies where the heroine stumbles across their godlike powers and then proceeds to bully all the men around them it just grinds my gears that THAT is what is supposed to represent feminine strength in society. None of those characters hold a flame to my awesome mother, and there are so many more women like her out there in the world. THOSE are the women we need to celebrate."

"One problem i have with the asohka show is how they made ZERO FUCKING EFFORT to make ahsohka look like she does in the clone wars show or rebels. Now, i know some retards will call me ""racist"" for this, but fuck it, im saying it regardless: ahsohka in the clone wars/rebels looks and sounds ""white"". From the narrower nose, small nostrils, smaller mouth/chin, white sclera, higher pitched voice (yes even older ahsohka), etc. The ahsohka in the ahsohka show looks like an entirely different tagrootan (the species of alien she is, for those who aren't aware). She has a wide nose and nostrils, large mouth, yellowed sclera and a deeper voice, all of which clearly signify a race swap behind the scenes from white to black. Now, i get that acting ability should be a primary indicator of who to hire to play a character, HOWEVER, you would not recast obi wan as a chinese person.

"This is not a new phenomenon.  I remember the Tomb Raider movies of the early 2000.  Angelina Jolie played Lara Croft like she was fearless, always in control, never worried about anything.  How can I care and be worried about a perfect character that is always in control and doesn't appear to give a damn?
Anybody remember Katniss from the hunger games?  How she had flaws and was relatable?  Did that franchise ever make any money?

"[""Well Laura Crofts appeal was the people who were fans of the game. She was hot, always in control (until she wasn't), fearless and didnt care for anyone else.

Side note: My mom LOVED Top Gun Maverick.	[]
"What Hollywood has forgotten is that no matter how unbelievable you get with stories, the characters have to be believable. 
In Top Gun: Maverick, I found Phoenix to be believable. I've run into women like her before. In aviation, there are parts that women have to be 'rough' because of the nature of who they fly/work with and the job itself. That doesn't mean they have to throw away ever being feminine. I've seen these same women dress to the nines when they are able to. 
I personally don't mind a strong female character. How to Train Your Dragon did a great job of that with Astrid. However, they kept her believable and as such people really came to like her. She got jealous, nervous, sad and made numerous mistakes. It was all a part of great and believable character development."	[]

"There seems to be a trend in long-running franchises these days of building out a niche product then expanding it out into the mainstream in an effort to get more people involved (read:make more money) where a company makes a product that does well with its intended (somewhat minority) audience, then adds elements that others enjoy which has a marginal cost of not including things that the original audience liked. They must think that the original audience is hooked already and will accept anything while moving on to an audience that sees more of what it wants to see in this franchise that didn't already appeal to them.

I've been a Magic: the Gathering player for over a decade now and that's definitely a trend that has been happening more and more."	"[""Yeah, kinda floored me when a friend told me they made a whole Lord of the Rings tie-in that drastically changes the whole game. He was all about it, so I'm happy he's digging it.

In most movies, the actors happen to be men. In these movies, it's women that happens to be actressses. They push the female narrative so its hard to watch as a male.

Imagine if Avengers was just a bunch of guys high fiving and ripping on each other every 10 minutes, we'd lose all female viewers.	[]
The last 10 years have refuted the premise of pseudo-left liberal politics. It states that gender-specific interests are a purely social constructs acquired through conservative valued teachings.

Even include a scene based on a real life event last year where 50+ cops attended an active school shooting but refused to engage with the perp because they were a trans person and didnt want to shoot them incase they get accused of a hate crime.

I actually think the Rey character was likable in nature. She legitimately seemed like a woman you‚Äôd want to follow into war. She more reminds me of a talented wrestler who wasn‚Äôt booked properly by the creative team. Her  origin, arch, and finale as a character was underwhelming, non-sensical, and uninspiring. Her chain of events throughout the trilogy made it impossible to become emotionally invested in her. She was different than Galadriel, Captain Marvel, and She Hulk who were actually insufferable characters who you begin to root against.	[]
"Ok so my whole thing is you can have a badass female But sacrificing everything else just to make her the only thing about the story is the problem.

Princess Leia ,Sarah Connor, and of course Ripley all existed as consummate "" girl boss"" characters before any of this business even started.There are dozens of other examples ,and it wasn't surprising  that the obvious contrivance and forcing of round pegs into square holes for the sake of it wasn't well received ."

The population of women that are superheroes nerds is hardly enough to carry a franchise. They fumbled the bag with these moves. Also, women expect men to pay for dates, movies are no different. Appealing to women is hard to do with things that generally attract men.	[]
Think the focus on woke/the message etc subverts another point you‚Äôve already made in previous videos. We‚Äôre back to idolatry in cinema- I think this is more dangerous to the development of our youth. We are only ever presented with these ‚Äústrong female characters‚Äù/ minorities etc as being fully realised- it leaves young just feeling inadequate and searching for reasons for this, rather than understanding the need to develop resilience in order to overcome adversity. I think it does a disservice to women and minorities who need to develop that resistance- it gives them no understanding of how one goes about developing their character.	[]

Look no further than woman's sports. WOMEN don't support WOMAN'S sports. Why? Because traditional male roles don't appeal to most women if women are the ones in those roles. You see this everywhere from the work world to entertainment. Left to make their own choices, women will NOT choose to support other women in male-dominates roles/fields. At least not in sufficient numbers. These flops happened because they ignored the obvious empirical evidence	"[""I got to make that a half exception it all depends on what female sports it is. Can I see during Olympic time yeah we're going to support team USA gymnastics team especially when it's being taped delayed on NBC. And we will also support some female UFC fighters if the card is attractable to the fans like Cris cyborg versus Amanda Nunez. As for the WNBA and this up and coming pwnhl hell no we are not going to see it. All and all females need to understand that they are less in some markets just like males are less in other markets that is true equality right there""]"

I think Disney is milking the cow dry on Star Wars and super hero related content. Yes some of this is Sony and DC, but people are bored of it. The movies being bad just makes it seem worse.

I think female-led stories are copping more blame than they deserve. Yes, superhero films used to be popular and are now less popular. Partly because they used to be frequently entertaining and are now mostly rubbish. That's happened at the same time as an increase in the number of female-led stories, but it's far from clear there's much of a causal relationship, they may just happen to be happening at the same time. The truth is that superhero film-makers seem to have run out of ideas and we need to try something else.	[]
I'm reminded of Salt, which was written for a male lead and changed to a female one at the last minute. As a result the character avoids being forced into a standard female mould, they're just a spy who happens to be female, and I think the movie is the better for it.	[]

I've actually been watching older movies and TV shows with more traditional storytelling and you know, stories. Disney made a big mistake thinking they could make movies AND have woke people making the movies. Honestly, I've always thought Disney makes crappy movies since they closed down Touchstone pictures. Other studios started to follow suit, even though nobody wanted to see the same homogenized, boring crap. I'm so glad these movies are flopping and maybe they will fire the terrible writers and get back some of the writers and story tellers that were replaced."	[]
"Somehow feminism changed from ""women are just as worthy as men"" to ""women are exactly like men"" . This might be a good thing on an individual level, as no one should be assuming they know about anyone interests or talents just based on gender. But on a population level , men and women have different preferences in entertainment. If some book or movie genres lean 75%  male or 75% female, writers should not try to twist the genre until the ratio is 50:50. Maybe there is an opportunity to market better to the 25% , its totally natural for any company trying to maximize profit to wonder if there is an untapped market. But the core of the artistic work should not be changed in pursuit of some arbitrary equal gender ratio. Some of these studios seem to think that if the world had no sexism, the gender breakdown of viewers for romance movies and action movies would be exactly the same, and any deviation from that is proof of sexism. Which the studio has a duty to fight either by forcing girl power messaging into their work, or outright blaming the customers."	[]

"Conclusion: Women in Hollywood were offended and/or jealous after decades of male-focused movie genres recording massive box office numbers, so they used words like ""equality"" and ""gender representation"" as excuses to to take over the genre in order to get in on the action. But now that these same women have managed to nearly bankrupt the entire industry, their simp enablers are scrambling to win back male audiences. However, the industry barely knows how to make content for audiences anymore, so we are witnessing the slow death of entertainment."	[]

Hollywood writers legitimately don't understand how the free market works; you make a product because people buy it, not the other way around.  People don't buy your product because you made it -- you make it because they buy it.  The consumer is in control here, not the producer.  As the producer, you make anything as long as it sells.  That's how you make money.  The problem is bigger than Hollywood because this is just one head of a giant marxist hydra.  Basically, radical marxists took over college universities, and they taught students a fictional story about how society conditions them to behave in a way that is unnatural to them, when the reverse is true:  society at large is controlled by the preferences of the individuals.  Women prefer love stories over action/thriller, and this controls what movies are produced for women.  Inline with the marxist schooling, they thought the reverse was true:  they thought Hollywood decides what women prefer.  Hollywood is a wake-up call to the marxists of America who need to leave la-la-land and start being realistic about how the world works.	[]

Maybe there was room for a spin-off or two, but I haven't found much interest in them. Particularly not Captain Marvel, who had to be conveniently absent from Endgame because her overwhelming power would have undercut the entire rest of the cast."	[]

Not to mention that even within the small percentage of women that watches these movies, a high portion of them are there as guests, dragged by their male friend/partner to watch a movie they did not actively choose... If the male friend does not go, she wont go by herself... Or you think I ever watched RomCom willingly?	['Is it that low?

It was thought to be a private thingy between husband and wife... Well, we all now what happened afterwards. As the time goes people swallowed that pill along with the other new ideological pills brought by the likes of Alfred Kinsey and playboy founder to the extent where the western society accepted the idea of having sex outside marriage, or even identifying a woman who lived for no more than a year with her pimp as a legitimate wife equal to a respectful house wife...

The same cycle is repeating itself now. Promoting feminism = spreading more competitive fallacies between men and women = destroying the nuclear family model = less marriage, more open sexual relationships = more lost bast@rd children = lost children.

Lost children means lost future generations, the confusion reaches a point where they can't even whether they're male or female... The average trans person who starts at such a young age spends an average of 300k-3M dollars on body modifications, surgeries, drugs and puberty blockers etc... This can be translated to market opportunities. Imagine the number of clinics and pharmaceutical companies that will hit it rich from spreading few misleading ideologies about gender and equality. These studios aren't losing a damn penny. It's all just as planned as a long-term investment for them."	[]
Ill say this again, The Boys actually did a good job with the girl boss stereotype and pretty much made fun of it at one point with advertising Queen Maeve throughout the seasons. The fight with stormfront not only made sense since most of the boys didnt actually have powers at that point, but the girls there had a real reason to jump her ass that was built up through all the characters EQUALLY and they arent shy to show their negative traits	[]

I think that the super hero movies have become oversaturated its always the same plot over and over again. With marvel its always the corny or overuse of jokes that takes away from the importance of the movie.	[]
My guess? It'll be another 10-20 years before Hollywood content is as good as it was in the 90s-2000s, assuming there's a full pivot back to zero pandering and heroic male characters. They fired so many experienced below-the-line workers based off their gender or skin color. That talent is somewhere else doing other things, why would they want to get burned again?	[]
If you break it down the entertainment companies are trying to force women to watch superhero and science fiction action movies and shows. And that is quite outrageous.	[]
It doesn't take a brilliant mind to realise insulting and lecturing the demographic that makes up most of your audience is not a great business plan.	[]
Star wars and LOTR in particular probably wouldn't be that hard to win people back. Those are franchises that a lot of people are invested on and truly want to see them succeed. Seeing them do Tolken dirty like that was almost heartbreaking, they talk about appropriating culture, Tolken is English culture.	"['Not just English culture, Tolkien is the father of modern fantasy and anyone who loves fantasy novels/games/movies should hate them for disrespecting his work.', ""My copy of LOTR and other Tolkien works haven't been edited. All I'm seeing is a bunch of losers making expensive but bad fan fiction. \nI imagine Star Wars fans with original copies of the sequels/prequels feel likewise, though perhaps to a different degree."", 'Star Wars in terms of anything to do with Ewan and Hayden HIT!!!! üî• anything after that and Og Luke sky walker idc but for those two I will see any show any movie any day because those two actors built my child hood', ""Eh, I don't know about SW. I could maybe be interested in a good old republic movie or something like that (and even then I probably wouldn't be that excited), but anything where the sequels are canon is dead to me. Might even have been dead since the day they decided to kill the old EU, to put it frankly."", 'I agree that Star Wars and LOTR could win most of the fans back, but not under Lucasfilm or Amazon. They have tarnished the brands, so it would take a wholesale purge of the current regimes for the former fans to even take notice. Great damage has been done, and it would take great time and effort to fix anything. An apology from Lucasfilm and Amazon for putting out garbage and then blaming fans for their failures should also be forthcoming...']"
I really hope that something changes now. I want good superhero movies again cause I completely lost interest in the whole genre after Infinity War Endgame. I just can't watch the new movies anymore. They are boring, predictable and soulless. Just another Girlboss who is even more invincible than the last invincible Girlboss. And besides that they belittle our beloved old heroes. Can't take this shit anymore	[]
Well put!	[]
A girl boss would be good if you had stuff backing her up like a big Superman like guy then a giant robot she controls making her a legit boss but Hollywood ain't what it used to be and woke has overran everything in Hollywood.	[]
That's how it's done Drinker.	[]
Female lead IP can and has worked, Barbie is the obvious example most recently,  but before that the original Wonder Woman was excellent and of course Alien and Aliens, the issue recently has been poor writing and character development along with a checklist from studios for obvious pandering.	[]

"I have no problem with female leads as long as they are well written and the story is good.  The problem with modern female leads is that they are all obnoxious, insufferable, and had everything handed to them on a silver platter.  They are strong by default and never have any real struggle, or any kind of growth.  

She Hulk has to be the worst offender I've ever seen of this.  She literally masters the Hulk form in seconds, and is stronger than Banner's Hulk pretty much from the get go, whereas it took Banner decades to get as far as he did and still hasn't truly mastered it.  The only ""struggle"" she has is people respecting her Hulk form more than her normal form.  That's pretty much it."	[]

Funny thing is the male audience love strong female leads when theyre actually well written. üòÇ I think the video game industry realizes this way more. Just look and Samus Aran and the OG Laura Croft. Hell I personally even liked Alice in the resident evil movies before she became a rip off of neo. Lol	[]
"What these studios aren‚Äôt understanding is that the women they‚Äôre trying to appeal to don‚Äôt have interests. They became ‚Äúfans‚Äù of comic book movies simply because it was a male-dominated space. They hate that, and so they joined in and tried to ruin it like they do with everything. 

But as soon as the studios give in and start appealing to them, they lost their male audience. But that doesn‚Äôt mean this new crowd of feminists are going to stick around. No, they‚Äôre just gonna follow the men and find the next thing to attack and ruin. Meanwhile, Marvel and Disney have lost their entire core fan base in pursuit of wokeness, and now they‚Äôre trying to blame it on us.

It‚Äôs crazy to watch."	[]
I only believe in Asian Girl Bosses!	[]
"The other inconvenient truth is that bad, shallow movies are bad and shallow. No amount of pandering will ever make up for a lack of substance or intrinsic appeal, to either sex or any...

That is their agenda. And it is working', 'I think a good person would better during those times.', 'A strong man? Yes.

I kind of wonder how many of those women attending the superhero films are there to hang out with men, eg, to go on a date or to watch with a group of friends. Not saying that women can't be into superhero movies, but I do think that it's a lot more likely to have a group of nerdy guys or a group of nerdy guys and girls than just to have a group of nerdy girls. As a female nerd myself, I'm a little put off by the changing of the genre to pander to what they think I want rather than what I actually like about it.	"['Said the quiet part out loud eh. MOst of the young women in my circles just went more as a social event. (and to see the ""hot guys in the new superhero flick"").

Your way forward won‚Äôt happen because it rubs the ‚ÄúHollywood messengers‚Äù the wrong way.  The true solution is nothing but romantic movies for women.  Unfortunately the derangement of Hollywood will make them gay and lame.  Most women aren‚Äôt gay.  Investing in film is dumber than investing in airlines.  CGI is the only path forwards.  That way, the amount of money that is spent is minimized by not having to pay actors.. so even attendance by a small subset of the population (angry gay women) will enough to just break even.	[]

"I remember the women protagonists of the past decades ago, Kill Bill, Kick-ass, Underworld, and many many many others. They were popular and hit-making too. So what happened?

The colleges and Universities were infiltrated by Wokeism, promoting useless gender studies courses and to become the woke factory that manufacture woke-infected activists that would later serve the looming mega woke agenda of the left at that time. Yes, that was part of their plan.

So what do you do with so many talentless woke activists that these colleges produc? Of course, give them jobs, any job that would let them serve in fulfilling their invisible masters' plan to infiltrate Hollywood, gaming industries, traditional news media, and even the health care industry. And if they didn't become HR and DEI officers, guess what, they turned to be script writers. Lots of them. But what do these woke feminist activists do with their new-found fulfilling career? They wrote stories and made their own woke selves into the characters on Disney and Sony. Characters that nobody else can't relate to, plot without human connection, and other overarching stories that's so lame. That's what happens when you have writers whose only qualification was a gender studies diploma or by a recommendation by their woke professors."	[]

If you want to see how to write a great female character watch Full Metal Alchemist brotherhood and take notes, it was written by a women(but a competent story driven writer).

All of the characters are far from flawless but that's what makes them a character and not a god that nobody relates to.	[]

Not that girlboss are bad... it's just so forced and disingenuous that both men and women hate it. There were definitely a bunch of female superheros that were loved (e.g. black widow). You could tell that the writer put time and effort into creating her.

Why is it so hard to acknowledge that men and women are generally (let‚Äôs go with the 80% rule here) different from each other in what interests them. As the Crtical Drinker points out with data they just like different things and the only thing companies really should be doing is marketing to their audience and if they want to try to scope creep into other markets proceed with caution and don‚Äôt antagonize your base.	"[""In the mind of the people who make these movies, women and men are different because the culture makes it so. So they think that if they change the culture they can change society and make women more like men (more equality). In their minds, if they make a mainstream successful movie catering to broad audiences, they are committing the evil of reinforcing the unfair status quo.\n\nObviously it's a complete load of BS, but this is just critical theory applied to entertainment, it's everywhere now.""]"
I love how liberals spend more time and energy defending a movie than watching it.	[]
These guys cant even define what a woman is, your graphs and statistics might as well be undeciphered hieroglyphs to them lol.	[]
I get what you‚Äôre trying to say here, but you seem to be assuming what the cause and effects are in this topic. I don‚Äôt see any reason to think that men inherently like one thing and women inherently like another. Most of the difference between men and women likes and dislikes are socially driven. Men are the primary audience of superhero movies because traditionally they have male protagonist. There are plenty of sci-fi or fantasy movies that contain good and entertaining female protagonists. The issue with the marvel flops isn‚Äôt because they were female leads. It‚Äôs because the stories were poorly written and poorly produced movies. In fact I would argue that one of the reasons why some of these movies haven‚Äôt been successful is because they wrote the stories as if females were going to be more in to different types of characters. If they had just treated the female lead movies as if there was a male lead and not changed the style of movie I think they would have been more successful. Characters like Captain Marvel and She Hulk are power focused characters. They are meant to overwhelm and overpower their opponents. The focus shouldn‚Äôt have been about their weaknesses and relationships. But regardless, Marvels problems are nothing to do with the sex of its leads, it is to do with money hungry attitude and ignoring character development and writing. They are trying to rush through characters with little to no character development and writing stories for maximum revenue instead of focusing on the story.	[]

That's the *REAL* problem with all these movies & shows:  the women are so *masculine and nasty!*	['I remember someone mentioned(and I can‚Äôt say they are off for saying this)that a lot of the female characters nowadays would be people that other people would try to avoid in real life if they were real.', '@@gianthand8130 EXACTLY! Nobody (even women) want to be around a woman who are so nasty & angry all the time. The scowles on Captain Marvel, Defender of the Cosmos (Dr. Strange MoM) and other women are so off-putting. Who wants to look at that all day?']
It's a shame that they've made so many bad movies, bc, despite what feminists say, men love to see bad ass women on-screen	[]
Thank you Critical Drinker! People are finally had enough with this stupid girl boss feminist bullshit. It‚Äôs getting tiresome and it needs to go away. That is major reason why 100% today‚Äôs movies suck. It‚Äôs all about ‚ÄúThe MESSAGE‚Äù to Hollywood, instead of writing a good story. People are done with woke feminist Hollywood. Period.	[]
I'm glad more people are finally waking up to this woke bullshit.	[]
"They aren't interested in turning a profit.  Not a valid assumption.  

They are communist revolutionaries creating party propaganda.  It's not entertainment.  It is programming for your mind.  They don't want your money.

The actual reason for Hollywood's decline into laughable nonsense has mostly to do with the social structure of civilization.   Agriculture-based civilization was founded on the illusion that nature can be controlled by human action.  Nature becomes a machine engineered and operated by specialists.   Generally, civilization opposes the natural cycles and processes of unbridled, evolving nature sometimes to people's benefit and sometimes not.  Truth is .... the more civilized (meaning urbanized) a person or a society becomes, the crazier and more disconnected from reality it gets. The hyper-urbanized, far-Leftists of Hollywood are a great case-in-point.  They are utterly disconnected from reality and thus try to engineer society and nature towards their bizarre political POV, i.e. girls are just like boys and they want the same things in life.  In an earlier generation, Walt Disney did the same thing with his Disneyland.  Disneyland was an attempt to control people and nature towards his particular political POV.	[]
Fun fact: Women actually love action movies	['Not that they don‚Äôt.  But I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt as drawn to the characters the Critical Drinker is talking about and referring to like a lot of Twitter/x simps would lead you to think.']

Maybe Hollywood should take something from the manga and anime world and learn how to actually write a great female character.

Of course after saying that it terrifies me to think that they would actually just ruin the source material instead.	[]
"I think the ""woke"" trend will survive for another couple of years, Barbie delayed things. As for the ""girlboss"" trope, don't forget Furiosa will be a thing this year, there will be a lot of gimmicks on that movie for sure (Miller consider himself a ""feminist"", so yeah). It got annoying, but I don't really mind this trend, it is what it is. Things lose control when people mix up trends with reality, the social debate and so on, that is obnoxious, the fanaticism of both ""sides"". But the mainstream media taking advantage of trends is a thing since forever, at this point you just let it go, Hollywood will show kids being molested if that is somehow ""trendy"" in our crazy western society, they don't care, it's all about the money"	[]
The weird thing is, they should all have learned this in 2016, with the Ghostbusters debacle.	['Not about money, it‚Äôs about sending a message.']

It doesn't really matter if the lead is a man or a woman, as long as they are well written. Ripley was cool because she was well written, so was Sarah Connor and many others. Same for men in movies - when they are boring, they make whole movie boring and that's really it.	[]
"Not sure what the problem is...The box office has proven it, over & over! Tell good stories! Just tell good STORIES! And folks will flock to it!

"I'm surprised we're gargling so much fiction as men that when the 'feminist' movement get female lead roles on movies they flop.
It begs the question if the main audience for fiction is male. And those males dont like to watch boss girls, doesnt it mean women just invest in more meaningful things to them, like a pair of shoes or a new bag instead of going out to a hollywood 'woke' blockbuster?"	[]
I found it surprising how the Disney screenplay writers kept reintroducing male heroes as old drunk layabouts in their latest movies. For example: Thor, Indiana Jones, Han Solo,	[]
"Completely agree with what your ""thoughts""; I would only add something that is really  important.
We're going through a massive change of the industry, cinema is dying, leaving the spot for the streaming services, and social media.
The ""younger"" audience don't even care about ""gender madness"", they simply rely on youtube and TikTok.
Unfortunately we're looking at what happened with CDs, and Mp3.
The ""story"" behind the music simply ended, followed by the rise of the ""singles"".
Only a few a now interested on a LP, 90% will have the ""Itunes way"", 2-3Hits at max.
Same for the films...the ""younger"" audience will probably wait to have everything streamed, so they can jump the scenes they don't like.
So..what next?
The ""cinema"" target is different and rely principally on 35/50+ audience..and that audience inherited exactly what you said.
The problem?
Well..the problem has got a name..WOKENISM.
Companies wants to mercify/capitalise, so, they tried to ""buy"" the  gender audience, mission failed.
IMHO, the solution is boicot, boicot, boicot, everything is consuminsm/woke, and not because we don't want to include, 
but because woke means sexisms and racism, and in their worst incarnation, mercified concepts."	[]

"Good point about men and women having dfferent interest, but i think that you slightly miss the point.
Of course women are not gonna show up instantly to watch superhero movies just because there is a female lead, but there is absolutly something to ""fix"" in that disparity. The easy answer is just cashing out and continue making boy movies and girl movies like a barbie vs G.I joe section in a toy store. That would result in more immediate revenue of course. But is it really what se want to accomplish ? 
If a young girl/boy is interested in a certain genre, would you want it to be seen badly because it is not ""meant for him/her ?""

I was thinking, can all this be fixed someday? Can the movie industry ever be like it was before wokeism infested it? Were the glory days just some unintended byproduct of an undertaking that was always meant to manipulate people for political gains? Or there's a totally down to Earth non-conspiratorial answer to it all? If our Drinker could get to the bottom of that, I'm pretty sure a lot of people would love to hear it!	['My hope is in God.']
I heard in late 2019 that there was an all female cast being written of Fight club but thankfully i think the couf couf put an end to that production so at least we can thank the couf couf fro something. Totally agree with everything you articulately said in this video and if i am honest i think TopGun Maverick was the starting point of this turn as it showed you can have females in leading roles without them having to over dominating the males to make the female characters look good also i think TeNeT had a part to play in that as well. Anyway great video as always and yes i will go away now hehe :) keep up the good work buddy you and Nerderotic are doing brilliant work bringing these issues to light.	[]
This is so on point. My daughters are about as into super hero, sci fi, anime, and all that stuff as anyone, but they are very turned off by this new slant. We even tried to watch Ms Marvel, etc, they hated it.  They never even asked to go see The Marvels.but for the record my wife loves action movies!	[]
"Hi Critical Drinker, i dont think i could have put any of this better myself. It feels like youve absolutely hit the nail on the head. I love the example with Barbie, needlessly injecting guns and tech into the film.. it would go against exactly what the audience is after! Brilliantly flipped on its head.

"I wanna point that problem is not with Girl boss trope. It is in writers. Wemen cant write good women characters. Look at Charlies Angels. You have three different girl bosses. And those movies are great.
I have even better example. Matrix. When Matrix was made by two brothers then all girl bosses where great. But then forth matrix was made by... one of those brothers who change gender. And he imidiently lost ability to write female characters."	[]
Okay I did quite enjoy ROP for what is was though, and thought Galadriel was portrayed well by the actress!	[]
You'd think that Hollywood would use common sense to target the demographic they are making a movie for, but I guess common sense is really not so common afterall. That's why I love The Boys, they perfectly portrayed how these big corporations work and think. Also superhero genre is almost dead, it died with Ironman, Captain America and Thanos. And I'm guessing Deadpool 3 will be the last great superhero movie for a long time.	[]

Sony is the only company that has admitted defeat, first with Ghostbusters, as there's another sequel for the course-corrected 'Afterlife' in production.

"I hate to say it because it will come across as an attack on what was a pretty good movie franchise but I feel the pendulum changed due to the Hunger Games.  It wasn't overnight but suddenly Hollywood had a female in an action role that people wanted to watch.  Not just the women but the men too.  And soon after Hollywood forgot any lessons they might have been offered in that series.  Katniss was good, but she was good for a good reason, she trained and had to break the law to be good to survive.  Now they just get to be good.  Period.  No reason or explanation.  Katniss could win, but every victory came at a personal cost.  From the girl dying to having to sacrifice her love for her guy she had to pay a cost.  Now the only people made to suffer are males and the audience.  At the end, after all the sacrifice and all the suffering and pain the whole reason she went through it all, to save her sister was forfeit.  Now the girl boss just struts to the next iteration.
The real problem is the wimps and simps and female empowerment freaks out there are clearly clueless about what a real powerful and respectable PERSON would look like.  They think Thor was seen as powerful because he had a hammer and muscles.  In the comics he was powerful because though a god he had hills to climb, rivers to cross and pains to bare.  I hope they will find a few good men, now thye wimps and simps to do some of the writing.  At least enough to influence.  Give me 1 Sarah Conners and keep your next 100 Rachal Zeiglers though."	[]

What they don't understand  is that WE, the women who actually enjoy sci-fi and fantasy and superheroes already loved and related to all that, before all the pandering. If they wanted something more balanced they could add more female characters but they would have to be characters, not caricatures.	[]
Drinker, you pointed out that the majority of the audience for super hero, action and sci-fi movies are male.  For that percentage of women who go along to these movies, are they going of their own volition, or are they tagging along with their husband/boyfriend?

This exponential power growth is in itself a problem. Remember how Iron Man had a hard time figuring out how to use his suit? And now i am sure the next girlboss iron-woman will do it instantly and much better.

"I work in marketing and the first thing every creative needs to know is ‚Äúwho is the customer or audience for my product?‚Äù. When you are coming in to market an existing product you don‚Äôt just suddenly change the customer segment you market to just because you don‚Äôt like the old one. You may over time expand your audience, but you never abandon your core customer base! And you certainly don‚Äôt insult your core in the process! NEVER! To do so is to risk losing your customers and your whole business.

Then there‚Äôs the whole issue with ‚Äòtokenizing‚Äô people to appeal to a new audience segment in a shallow way. As Drinker points out that‚Äôs essentially what these writers did with the Female ""Girl Boss"". How are these characters more than a cheap pastiche of what a woman looks like? They aren't. It‚Äôs a shallow, one dimensional portrayal of this demographic that is totally unrelatable. That's exactly what South Park was taking the piss out of in the Panderverse!

I can guarantee that this fiasco will be a front and centre case study of what-not-to-do in Marketing 101 clasess across the world for the next 20 years!

If Disney/MCU/Lucas Films want to salvage their brands they should send every staffer back to basic marketing training and fire the executives who were in charge of this madness. Kathleen Kennedy would be a good start and send a clear signal to the rest of the staff, investors and disenfranchised customers that they mean to start fresh."

That's a decision by leadership at the top - the Kathleen Kennedys. They would then go out and contract the creatives to work on a project (usually third party companies, not wagies).  Clearly the core root of the problem lies at the top, which totally abandoned their base audience in pursuing on a non-eixstant one. As I said, those folks should be fired for such disasterous decision making and absolute ignorance of fundamental business practices.\n\nThat said, everyone else below them is going to need re-training to re-orient them in the direction the new leadership needs to take this ship. Everyone has to be pulling in the same direction if Disney/MCU/Lucasfilm is to be saved from ruin.\n\nSo I think the real question is does Bob Iger have the leadership capacity to axe Kennedy or is going down with her?"", ""I'm a VP of Marketing and co-sign this 100%."", 'My genuine question as someone who knows nothing about how these choices are made, how can people who work in your field seriously look at these trailers put them together and feel people will seriously be excited unless it‚Äôs just new to them, as a nerd of a lot of different things it feels like the same is being done all around and almost every new movie or show feels almost like a parody.']"
I slightly disagree with the conclusion of this video.  There are plenty of women who like superhero films/shows.  Just like there are men who like romance stuff.  I mean, just look at the success of various anime series which have done both.  The underlying factor is how it's implemented.  Tons of men will go watch a romance anime because they like the female characters.  Tons of women went to the early Marvel or James Bond films because it had shirtless hunks fighting for a woman.  What changed is what the video points out.  Hollywood went full contradictory mode and tried to subvert every time-tested archetypes.  Having a movie with a mostly female cast can be a winning strategy.  Just not a bunch of smug bitches.  Even the women who are that way themselves don't like seeing other women acting that way in a movie.  Something even fricken Hallmark learned long ago.	[]

There‚Äôs another percent of viewers that is being left out. Women like me. I LOVE good action and super hero movies. You put on an 80‚Äôs action movie or the original Marvel movies, I‚Äôm in 100%. So you‚Äôd think these movies would appeal to me. But they don‚Äôt. Not even a little bit. They took everything awesome about superheroe movies and removed them and replaced them with overbearing feminist messaging instead of just good old fashioned story telling. That‚Äôs not what I love about watching those kinds of movies. I love watching a big strong man with good morals fighting bad guys. I love action scenes where they physically dominate and fight with everything they have. Watching a 110 lb woman unrealistically fighting stereotypes of ‚Äúbad misogynistic men‚Äù is not interesting. And their stories aren‚Äôt even good. I want to watch the hero‚Äôs journey! I want to see them struggle and fall and share in that triumph when they finally succeed.

I'm a mystery, sci-fi, fantasy loving female. I find romcoms unrelatable. I'm not curling up on the couch with a tub of ice cream to watch a Hallmark movie marathon. But I know I'm an exception.

We need to do something about clothes. Clothes are so unnecessary and expensive. Why don't we run naked in the streets? During summer it would be so nice to let your balls air out. During winter you would need clothes but it would be entirely optional. We need to break boundaries. We need to go to Congress and bring light to a proper nudist lifestyle. Part of the reason why sexual crimes happen is because clothes hold a mystery and creeps want to solve the mystery.  If we were all nude there would be no secrets.	[]
Insulting women by assuming they‚Äôre going to flock to an almost entirely female movie is just as bad as assuming that any male dominated film is going to overjoy anyone with a pair.	[]
I think what's also interesting about trying to make these female-centric superhero/comicbook/action movies is that these studios are actually turning away their biggest female audience: those of us who have always loved superhero stories, comic books, and action. There's already a large group of us that grew up on comic books and superhero shows and don't want to watch our favorite characters and stories be turned into something we don't recognize. I grew up on the 90s Marvel and DC cartoons and have loved them my whole life. I love the sincere and interesting superhero stories that I grew up on, and that's why I would never go see something like Madam Web or The Marvels.	[]

"In my unimportant opinion, I don't think Hollywood studios ""message"" wasn't anything insidious. It's them taking fanbases for granted. ""They'll watch it no matter what"". Once they no longer saw box office growth, they began to attempt to grow their audience by grabbing people who didn't traditionally watch these male dominated movies (on top of maintaining a healthy ESG score which is a different topic alltogether). 

It failed and they managed to alienate and lose their ""unloseable"" audience."	[]

"Men produce super heroes but also men in real life does the same thing, maybe not lift a building but they are fireman they are in military etc.. even ordinary males protect females in the street (well more before but not anymore because of feminism) meanwhile there is not alot of girls that actually do the same as the one in the movies, not even close. Most girls still act like girls, use feminine, act like a victim and their attitude actually doesnt have the same that a superhero has, because its never in a female characteristic to have one... because male gender doesnt fake it, it comes naturally to male( being gentlement, protective, kind ) while women are different, women CAN be kind but most are too emotional ( which the movie lacks for female characters ) most are bitchy ( they got that part in the movie ) and they love ( which for some reason, movies want them to be single and independent ) this is why audience could never relate...... reason why women watch romantic movies and men watch super heroes because it speaks to them

There could have been such a great back and forth between them before credits rolled and the inevitable continuation of the tale of Dracula as we know it.

I believe that movies can benefit in general by not being one dimensional bro-fests or girlboss bonanzas. There's a middle group that exists for good writers who are able to add real depth and character. There's a time and place for everything.

- Make a likeable female protagonist. 
- Action scenes should fit the female body, not a muscular guy.
- They must be as hot as their male counterparts. I bet that female audiences only like handsome guys with six packs in movies. So why criticize men for liking beautiful women?"	[]

"Always hated the term ""Girlboss"" in movies and shows. The way I understood it originally I immedeitly thought of Tangled, Brave and Mulan.

Girls who are feminine but are able to show that they can be awesome at tha same time without feeling like ""Oh they are just like boys!""

No when I thought of Girl Bosses back then I thought of them as people who are able to stand alongside boys without feeling like they are better or worst at things. They just are as good as boys at being awesome and that everytjing they do a girl or boy can do as well."	[]

"I love that you explained WHY these movies are failing and didn't just sum it up with, ""it's cause they're WOKE dur hurr"" like many other right-leaning channels. Men and women have different interests, and Hollywood needs to understand that."	"['Well that‚Äôs the reason they are failing because they aren‚Äôt thinking of the audience but the reason they aren‚Äôt thinking of the audience is because they‚Äôre trying to go for woke movies.', '@@really_dont_know1681 Simply calling something woke doesn\'t explain why it\'s failing since there are a lot of popular movies out there that can be classified as """"woke."""" For instance, a lot of conservatives call the Barbie movie woke, yet it made billions of dollars. \n\nMost of these movies fail because they are trying to appeal to two audiences at the same time. Women generally don\'t watch action movies and men don\'t like getting talked down to by girlbosses.', '@@jorami4838 It made billions of dollars because its target audience was women and many younger women and girls.  Young girls more than likely don‚Äôt care about politics and about 40% of women aged 18-29 in the U.S. identify as left leaning so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that a movie considered woke and aimed at that audience was still wildly successful.  However when it comes to superhero movies or sci fi and action the audience is different.  The reason the movies are failing is because companies like Disney are trying to keep a high CEI score which basically means the more ‚Äúwoke‚Äù aspects that are used in your companies products like adding ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù to movies the higher their CEI score.  Disney has been pumping out all these movies in the hero genre with these aspects and they keep flopping because the audience these movies target doesn‚Äôt want to see that in the movies, they care about the movie and characters being relatable not how diverse they are.  So yeah I‚Äôd say adding the woke aspects to these movies are going against their audience hence why it is part of the reason they keep failing.']"

"1:23 I can't believe I'm about to say this because I want the 'rah rah girl power' movement to. . . disappear. I'll say disappear because I can't use more colorful, truthful language to convey my feelings on the matter while still ensuring the comment stays up. But anyway, the problem isn't 'women.' The problem is 'mid-thirties man-hating women who don't even know why they're there.' Nobody cared that Sarah Connor was the protagonist of T2. In fact, it actually worked out for the best. Same thing for Ripley in Aliens. And, as long as we're mentioning the obligatory, obsequious 'I don't hate women, really' examples (seriously, you people need to learn that they will never stop accusing you of being misogynists, stop trying to convince them you don't hate women, they don't care if you hate women or not, it's just a weapon to use against you), how about Charlie, from the legendary film, The Long Kiss Goodnight, otherwise known as Samantha Caine?

I've got some bad news for those of you who think this is going to mean positive change; imagine the Buzzfeed Try Guys being the new wave of male action stars. That's what will replace this. What? You thought that because they're getting rid of the girlboss (maybe, that remains to be seen) that they're going to go back to making good movies? They _hate_ good movies. They don't believe in human universals like primal fear, love, appreciation of beauty, or death. In fact, they devote their lives to using whatever means at their disposal to convince the public that such things don't exist. You're not getting Ellen Ripley, Sam Caine, or Sarah Connor back, ever. They're gone. They don't make 'em like they used to. It's an actual miracle that we got Jack Reacher, and frankly I still haven't been able to explain that fluke, but you can bet, despite its success, we won't be seeing it again."	[]
"Delayed reaction is result of the project timeline and long term planning. That is why we have ""out of touch"" movies. It is better to push them to completion and recoup something then cancel them outright (we won ever learn about the stuff that was cancelled).

"Well made action movies get more total female audience anyway. Also i don't think people give a damn about actor's or other staff genders and if they ""fit"" with a genre(as long as movie is well made and well written).

It had some examples where in 70s or 80s, cant remember, they basically put children, who are newly began playing with toys, into two different rooms. One full of boys other full of girls. They put all kinds of toys in a box to both of the rooms. And watched what happened.

Simple, boys went to box and picked tigers, cars and plastic guns while girls went for teddy bear and dolls. 

Girls began to play with eachother like they were trying to form a family, while boys were racing and fighting each other.

It really is a wonder that Hollywood has taken so long to realize what a regular person off the street could've told them for free at any given time. Splitting your fan base doesn't work. Hiring people who actively hate the thing they're working on won't work. Hiring staff who not only hate the material/lore but the fanbase itself is a failure waiting to happen. Telling your audience to bugger off because a movie wasn't made for them has never worked nor will it ever because they will happily see something else. Hiring talent based on check boxes gets you nothing but a list of problems. Lastly, slapping a new coat of paint and rewriting history while ruining everything your legacy is build upon is a cheap to do business and everybody knows it. There's a reason why when you do the bare minimum to hold something together its called mickey mousing it.	[]

Men in action movies have it easier because no one is bothered with them being tortured, wounded and humiliated.

So many have said it before, but I will say it again: as a woman I don't care how many women are in a movie. I want to see a good story. I can relate to male characters just as much as to female ones, so just because a movie has only female characters doesn't mean I'm going to like it	[]

Marketing was very clear on who the target demographic was supposed to be. Marvel projects that have had a particular audience for the majority of their existences.

I mean, they made more money than God when they made the origin movies and the Avenger movie when, you know, THEY STUCK TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL..... But now I think now that since they have all this ""FU money"" they're trying their best to desensitize the population and conditioning them to expect less when it comes to entertainment. Hell. It could be just their egos. Who knows. I didn't think anyone could be that stupid but stranger things have happened. It's just that this is starting to feel more like from design anymore. Whatever that design is is anyone's guess."	[]

To be fair barbie should have been written better and a lot of people say only 1/3 of it is great.	[]
I think the issue here is that fans of superhers and barbies are in their late 30s, early 40s. And they are married. That's why there is a a significant amount of men watching barbie and significant amount of women watching the avengers. They are asked to see it by their loved ones. If you have a superhero movie no man wants to see, its not like their wife will ask them, because wasn't going to see it in the first place. Obviously, I am generalizing, but it makes sense. I have seen more romantic comedies that my wife wanted to see than girl boss superhero movies neither me nor my wife cared about. And if my wife wants a girls night out, she isn't going to see a superhero flick over, say, mean girls reboot	[]
It's true, I went to No Way Home and there were mostly dudes, across the spider verse had mostly dudes sitting but Barbie was full of women and a few dudes.	[]
"""Strong, badass female"" has come to mean something very different from the Linda Hamilton/ Sigourney Weaver heyday. Ripley & Connor were both flawed, interesting, asskicking female characters that were fun to watch. 

When I first saw Alien, it never crossed my mind that I was watching a female main-  it was just a very good movie. 

Now, every female is a cardboard cutout- greet every man with sarcasm and a kick to the crotch, expressionless, dead eyes, and perpetually set up in an endless series of contrived scenes where men act like some cartoonish Harvey Weinstein, so the female cutout can put them in their place. 

Also- Ghostbusters sucked, and Lucifer wasn't a tall girl."	[]
"As a female who prefers male-focused genres, I'm glad the girlboss crap is coming to an end. I just want a well written female character in the main cast I can relate to, and she's just getting to do the cool action or sci-fi stuff like the men and otherwise isn't different from them.

The top comment has good examples, and another is Ridley Scott in Alien. She's an absolute fucking badass, and is someone anyone would want to be like, regardless of gender. She just *happens* to be female."	[]
"Do you want to see great movies with real life female super bosses?
Watch Inn of the 6th Happiness.  Madame Curie.  Mother Teresa: No Greater Love.  The Iron Lady.  The Great Raid (the nurse that risked her life to save Allied soldiers).  Florence Nightingale. Band of Brothers (the angels of Bastogne nurses.)  This is just a few.  But none of these movies were Woke."	[]
The premise you use for understanding the wokeist decisions is flawed.  They believe there are no inherent s*x based differences, we are just amorphous genderless blobs of human.  The insane world that they live in says that males and females should equally gravitate to both Top Gun and Barbie.  That is why they say insane things when they smash their face upon the brick wall of objective reality.	[]
"Chinese Wuxia (Martial Arts) movies have effectively shifted their target demographic from predominantly male to increasingly female audiences. This shift wasn't due to a focus on girl bosses, but rather on elements like romantic storylines, attractive actors, stunning actresses, picturesque scenery, and more.
Despite a decline in the quality of their fight scenes, male viewership has waned while female viewership has surged. This shift marks a successful transition in the direction of Chinese Wuxia cinema today."	[]

"I tried watching Colombiana recently, but even though it was a 2011 film it had exactly the same feel of ultimate girl boss from the very beginning. Some how Cataleya who can't be more than 12 or 13 out-smarts, out parkours and out runs all the adults she comes across. Like this is pre-the15 years of training.

The whole film seems to be a riff off Law Abiding Citizen, but unlike in that film, where Gerard Butler gets consumed by revenge and goes on a revenge killing spree and eventually dies because of it... But in Colombiana does Cataleya too get destroyed the vengeful moster she turned herself into? Nope, bus ride into the sunset, a mass murderer goes free."	[]

yes, the US film industry has arguably overcorrected in its representation of heroic female protagonists - and it has certainly greenlit some stinkers as a result - but it only takes one movie where your putative 'girlboss' is well written and convincing to illustrate that these qualities need not be restricted to male protagonists.
and let's be honest, there have been just as many shit movies written by men with male protagonists? maybe you should follow up with a a video titled, the Death of the Badboy"	[]

"Perhaps one problem is the ""Ripley factor"" (or ""Sarah Conner factor"" in a tiny font); the success of portraying a female protagonist in an action genre picture.  Sigourney Weaver said in an interview that her character should never be written ""as a gym coach, gruffly telling everyone: 'Now listen up!  Here's what we're gonna do...'""  That is, the character's actions and motivations must be consistent with their nature.  No one wants to see a flawless heroine anyway.  It's overcoming believable limitations that's interesting."	"['Connor*', 'Well said. \n\nI watched rebel moon yesterday and it was freaking boring because of that. The hero is a female and she never loose pretty much. And you can feel the ideologies in the movie. Its really bad', 'Well said, Sarah and Ripley were not rolling in masculine energy. They are believable characters.', ""Ripley was just used, because it would not be acceptable in a feminist age, that a male destroys the Alien queen with pure force. That's why it's a female, written by a man and made superficially female."", '@@urlauburlaub2222 LOL, \'79 was definitely not a ""feminist age"".

Some of the best action movies of all time have female leads. Terminator 2. Aliens. Resident Evil. The Long Kiss Goodnight. Tomb Raider. All great movies with badass babes. But they were interesting, sympathetic characters you could relate too. Not girl-bosses.	[]
"Secondary point: 
Have you noticed how most of the marketing of ""female led"" / ""girlboss"" etc. seems to be designed like they are apologizing for having a hero / protagonist that is not male? Having a chip on their shoulder about the issue does not change the fact THEY are the ones making an issue out of it. If they really meant what they said about representation, they wouldn't feel the need to over-emphasize it every time they made a film like that. They could just tell a good story, with good acting, and let those chips fall where they may. 

So if the executives' opening move is to apologize for or try to counteract societal racism or sexism, it is their own biases & sexism they are overcompensating for. 
THEY are the ones who expect a female-led action movie will not make money on its own merits. (Or they do not want to invest in it having merit.) 
THEY are the ones who think men only want to see movies about men, and women only about women. (Proven untrue, yet the myth remains? That's literally prejudice.)
THEY think they need a social-justice marketing strategy to justify their film's existence and make money. (Good stories need no justification.) 
 
The audience (society) just wants to be entertained. Make a good & interesting film, something entertaining and memorable. It does not have to be all things to all people/demographics. If it's good, and you support it with good marketing (not bury it in bad marketing or make it entirely a product of cynical marketing), then people will go see it - theaters, TV, streaming, whatever. Nobody is excluded from watching something, and if they hear there's something that's actually good, the audience will find it on their own."	[]

"BINGO. The ""GIRL BOSS"" started LONG ago. Way back with Ripley in ALIENS. It snowballed for years, till it was out of control, and brought us to where we are today."	"[""Yeah, I mean, isn't this arts/entertainement medium in a nutshell? To push out some crap message?""]"
There are still plenty of girl bosses in romance movies. They can stay there.	[]
"I've got no problem with the (hate to use the cliche term) ""girlboss"". If done right, a movie with a female lead can be a hit, can have quality, and it has been proven, can draw an audience. 
Too bad the media megacorporations have no idea what the terms ""quality"" or ""story integrity"" mean. If they actually create one of these hits, try to remember it is some rarity that slipped under the bosses' radar and landed on target, instead of being shot to pieces by executive meddling. (So good movie making is like a drone attack - funny huh?)  

They are too busy pandering, because they think that is what earns them more revenue (even though it's clear now it actually earns them less). 
Are you worried that you are being force-fed ""the message"" because the media elite really believe in it? Don't worry, because they never did. It is (and has always been) a marketing ploy. They actually give zero fucks about feminism, diversity, social justice, or any sort of actual meaningful representation on screen. It is still all about capitalism, milking creative people like cows before sending them to the slaughterhouse. 

These same big money executives will push hard on the ""girl power"" message at the same time as they are Harvey Weinstein-ing their leading ladies somewhere in the back room. And if they have a female accomplice executive, that person is just as soulless and every bit as much their equal when it comes to sucking creative people dry then discarding the dessicated husks of their careers. Those are the real girl-bosses. De-emphasize ""girl"" and emphasize ""boss"" if you want to really understand how and why it works this way. 

The marketing zeitgeist once under-represented some, then over-represented them, and who the fuck knows what comes next, other than the fact it never was and never will be sincere.  The only certainty is that the bosses do what they do because they expect to be paid big dividends by pandering to trends, riding each and every bandwagon until the wheels fall off."	[]

"Female comic book fan here: We don't like being pandered to, dear Hollywood. 
If you want to grow your female fan base, target marketing at the og fans bringing their daughters, sisters, girlfriends, and so on to these films. My dad introduced my mother and I to comics. That's how a lot of the minority female audience got into this genre. Stop effing with the actual product and just shift marketing towards men with daughters, granddaughters, girlfriends, wives, female friends, nieces, and so on. Make comic books the ""it"" thing to do for the men in our lives. Want to get dad something more thoughtful than his 80th necktie? Take him to that new superhero movie you know he's been dying to see! Something like that.
Offer free tickets to women to your films on a certain day or certain showing (bars do that to bring in more women - in turn, bringing in more men, too). Give free comics on opening day with the purchase of a ticket; bringing in more people to the films AND the comics. Why do you think baseball stadiums do giveaways to the first so many fans who buy a ticket to the game? Why do conventions and concerts give swag bags to people who spend a certain amount of money for their tickets? Why does Free Comic Book Day exist? If you want to shift your target demographic without destroying your existing fan base (as this will ensure the business to fail), you have to transition into that new fanbase slowly AND spend a lot of time and money on advertising. Comic book industry, you aren't social media; following trends will lose you money rather than gain it. Leave the trends to us on social media and you go back to creating art. Trends work here because the content is free. Hollywood content is a massive financial commitment to get behind. No one who has their own money (ie: older teens and adults - I don't think you're looking to get 6th graders to your pg13 and r rated films) aren't going to spend it just to follow a trend. Nor will they spend it on a trend that requires a time commitment. A three hour+ long film is not going to be appealing if the entire selling point is ""Yeah! Girl power!"" That's not even what got butts in the seats for the Barbie Movie!"	[]
"I grew up watching Star Trek: Voyager and never had a problem with Captain Janeway or Seven or Belanna. Maybe I‚Äôm blinded by nostalgia but that show did a way better job of having female to male power dynamic and just interplay than any of the new star trek.

"Say what you will about Amazon, but once they get the numbers, the FOLLOW those numbers. Yeah, Rings of Power went off a cliff, but they got the information off of that failure, and now they're correcting course, which you can see by their rework of Silk. It isn't even necessarily about the man/woman audience. Another whole thing lost in the sauce of all this is how every character gets changed characters. Madame Web did this, as the original character was pretty old, well into her 60s to early 70s. Parapalegic, blind and deaf to a disease that has had her living the vast majority of her life attached to a life support rig shaped like a spider's web. She's enigmatic, with remarkably little known about her history and background, despite forty years of comics. Her powers are in-born, she's a mutant, having pre-cognition, telepathy, astral projection, and can perform psychic surgery on a target's mind. Despite ALL of this, she is a hero, in a situation where no one would blame her if she just lived a quiet life away from all of it. Instead, despite the dangers, she works to help the world.

Movie Web is your standard girlboss run, which demeans the original character, and they got way too into linking her and everyone to Spider-Man right out of the box, in a way that drags down Spidey and company. One of the main reasons that Madame Web reveals herself TO Spider-Man is a trait that is unique to how Peter operates: Despite a chain of losses, Peter is still fundamentally optimistic and holds himself to a level of responsibility that no other superhero in Marvel comes close to, despite everything in his life being much easier if he didn't. From my reading, she sees not only something of herself in Peter, but something that she wants to be as well."	[]

"As a woman I have to say Hollywood doesn't actually understand what women want in a movie. These so called female audience oriented movies have all sucked. I have not seen any of the captain marvel movies (refuse to) and I sure as heck didn't go to see madame Webb. I watched black panther 2 in theaters, but that was more to see how they would tie it up with Chadwick's passing and the controversy surrounding the actress who played his T'challa's sister. I wanted to see if they'd keep to the comics and she still inherit the mantel. I was still very disappointed in how they handled the movie over all.

Yes it is great to see a strong female character as the lead. The problem is, Hollywood doesn't know what a strong female is. They think an over powered, fighting the patriarchy, perfect as she is, no character development, no flaws, surrounded by dumbed down males is the epitome of a strong female. I'm sorry, but I'm just not here for that and Hollywood won't be getting my money off it."	[]

"Its crazy how a film made for women by women bombed because women didnt go see it.... And then they blame men.

There are less women that went to see john wick than men, but it was still successful. Meanwhile women would say ""the WNBA should get paid just as much as the males do in the NBA"", while not knowing a single team, never going to a game, and all around not supporting them. There are more women in the world than men, If women supported what they virtue signal that they want, IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL!!!! nstead you take male concepts.... make it female....then say men are sexist if they dont support it......

I not here to say women should or should not read DC or Marvel, but to say as you did you read what you like, and you don't read what you don't like why because it is everyone's human right to do as their please when it comes to what you read because beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I do not behold DC or Marvel, but I can understand why my very old GI father who did love, now hates DC, and Marvel today because it is his right to do so!

Might be a bit easier for you to converse in the future if you squash that and start acting like the adult you want to be seen as.']"
"I actually went to Madame Web this morning (I have a subscription so it was 'free' and I wanted to see if the reviews were accurate). If this was what they hoped would appeal to my sexual demographic, I am insulted. It's slow, it's badly scripted and directed, the actors are all phoning it in (especially the baddie, who I swear was dubbed from a studio in post-production - his speech is WEIRD), stuff happens that is totally unbelievable in-world, they have long shots where nothing happens except a slow zoom in on a face that isn't changing expression at all...

I didn't find it as offensively Women Are Awesome And Can Do No Wrong as e.g. Captain Marvel - at least they tried to give this woman a character flaw (avoidance of responsibility) - but it's just a really badly made film. Ordinarily I never make noise in a cinema because it's rude to the rest of the audience, but at several points I couldn't hold in my baffled commentary. But maybe I'm not the kind of female demographic they're targeting: I really liked Marvel's actual superhero films like Iron Man, Captain America and Thor."	[]

I'm  sorry because I usually agree with you,  but I  don't agree with your premise that this failure was about men and women liking different things.  In these cases men AND women were on the same side NOT liking that men were left out AND that the product was  crap.	[]
It comes down to the same problem. Men are not supporting female projects. Sort of like carnivores aren't supporting vegan restaurants.	[]
The establishment exploits women because they are easier to manipulate. Only problem is they are whimsical and their whim changes from moment to moment.	[]

"I will believe the girlboss character is gone when it is *Gone* not several YouTube channels say so because  Disney/Sony/Hollywood in general made üí© Movie 9,936,552 while blaming fans, white men, and anyone in the center onward to the right before said movie even dropped it‚Äôs teaser trailer.

"This is not a slight towards Drinker here as I am nowhere near as intelligent as he is but  this explanation that men and women are different and like different things comes across as revolutionary to some people. 
Yes, men and women are equal as far as our humanity goes but we are inherently different.
Since the dawn of time books, poems, music, and movies have been made  addressing this issue.
We're different for a reason. 
If it's God, the universe, or Nature itself, We're different because our strengths compliment the other sex's weaknesses and vice versa.
Humanity would never have progressed if we all had the exact same thoughts and never questioned anything."	[]
im gone for good man, i couldnt care less about any form of visual entertainment anymore. movies and tv are dead to me unfortunately	[]
what is still surprising to me is we can show many examples of show/movies where women play the leads and we love them....probably because the writers focused on making a good movie before focusing on what is between the legs of the person reading lines	[]

The problem is that it's forced and not organic.  No one minds a well written movie.  None of the movies featured in this video were well written.

Ignoring that and holding everyone and everything to the same standard, is doomed to fail, and movies are a fantastic example of that."	[]

I wonder if anyone from these studios watch your videos. Fuck I hope so lol.	[]
"Drinker, I think you missed an important possibility.  These studios aren't stupid, and see the same statistics regarding audiences that you do.  Assuming that ""profit"" was the driving force for the studios over the last several years, then there is absolutely zero possibility that this shift towards promoting ""girl bosses"" and diminishing male characters was a business decision. Calculate into the equation that the most ""iconic"" (socially impactful?) franchises were swallowed up by the large studios, especially Disney, then you come to an almost inescapable conclusion that these franchises were purposely ""de-masculinized"" simultaneously.  Also disturbing is the rhetoric coming from the large hedge funds that control the Boards of the studios, regarding DEI and other social engineering objectives.  In short... when you put it all together there is a glaring possibility that these iconic franchises (and new franchises/characters) have been subject to a planned demolition with a structured ""re-imagining""  with the objective of multi-vector social change (engineering?)... all backed by the studios, who are controlled by their Boards, who are in turn controlled by the giant hedge funds.  Now ask yourself, why? Just something to consider."	[]

"I think that the hate leveled at 80s action/sword and sorcery movies by women has a role to play here. Implausible feats of strength, plots that are equally unbelievable, flat characters, gratuitous violence, and a smattering of cheesecake wrapped up into what was described as ""male power fantasy"" worked in a time when we allowed movies to be just fun. We stopped making those movies for the most part at the end of that decade, and the world rejoiced. Commando and Rambo II are fun movies, and still worth a watch, but aren't nearly as good as T2. The girlboss movies are the exact same movies with gender roles reversed, with a heaping helping of ""the message"" thrown in for good measure. Most women didn't love Arnold, Stallone, or Norris, and let's be honest, if they did enjoy the movies it was for sweaty abs. Why on earth would people think that they'd like the same thing if you swapped the genders 40 years later? Same concept: MCU phase 1 movies were fun, but I wasn't particularly impressed by anything other than Scarlett Johanssen in tight outfits, and some of the jokes. Give it up, or give us MCU T2, something that both men and women can appreciate."	[]

Modern women are going to feel suppressed when businesses stop hiring them because they are becoming liabilities. Who wants someone that will be the first to possibly use false allegations of sexual harassment? Who wants someone that constantly complains that That believes that even though they work less hours, take more days off. Expecting that same money as someone that does work longer and takes less days off. Women firefighters can only do 30% of the job required by men. Yet they get paid the same. Plus women want jobs that pay less. Over 90 % of Carpenter's, electricians, block masons, steel workers, military, offshore drilling, and the list goes on and on and on. Even if they did the jobs. For the most part. Men do those jobs better, faster and more consistently.	[]

balanced, epically good, well presented, and Gal Gadot was the perfect actress.
Only real ""HIT"" for a female lead in.. 10-15 yrs ?? out of all the Marvel, DC, Superhero movies ?? maybe longer..??
Discount "" Capt Marvel"" as it simply had fans already dying for ""End game"" and with ""Infinity war"" as its lead in, people went regardless. had it come AFTER Endgame,, say a few months ?? I bet it does HALF that box office..

"Whether it's a male or a female, the protagonist needs the hero's journey where they start out dumb and naive, become hardened by a tragic event, learn how to fight evil, usually with the help of someone older and wiser who has done it before and then in the end they defeat the villain with their newfound strength and ability.

BTW we identify with this because this is how life works. No, we'll never fight terminator robots or Darth Vader, but in the beginning, we're all mouth breathing CHUDS with messy rooms, no purpose, a drain on mom and dad's finances who drive our parents mental and can't get a date to save our lives. Then we grow up. We find a trade. We learn to take of ourselves. We get a little dough in our pocket. We get some game. We buy a nice condo. We settle down and get a spouse, kids, a dog and then we become the Obi Wan Kenobi who teaches our padawan kids how to fight the Darth Vaders of the world if they're willing to listen."	[]

I'm a woman, and I like strong female protagonists like Dana Scully or Clarice Starling or Sarah Connor or Tiana from the Princess and the Frog. Smart, resourceful, reliable heroines who have an equal stand with the men. I do not identify myself with them too much cos I'm a milder person in general, but I see them as role models showing that men and women can be equally strong, capable, and inspiring characters, each in their own way.

I know it‚Äôs convenient for narrative purposes to say things like this, but it‚Äôs simply not correct.

The movie didn‚Äôt fail because it was female-centric, it failed because it was a piece of garbage. With that said, he raises a lot of decent points here and he is 100% correct about the writing teams feeling like they have to create impermeable female characters that nobody identifies with."	[]

As a female that really enjoys SciFi, Fantasy and Superhero genres I find nothing to disagree with here. The other aspect that Hollywood is missing re male characters in girl boss movies is that, in the main, women that enjoy these genres also want the male characters to be appealing in the same way that men want the female characters to be appealing. Weak, incompetent, stupid men are not appealing.	[]
Drinker never misses.	[]
I highly recommend the Apple TV show/first season of ‚Äúhighjack‚Äù with idris Elba‚Ä¶ a good action thriller that makes a point to give the middle finger to the message during the climax.Great show.

If i want to see a ""strong female character"" I want it to feel more natural, not shoehorned in there because they want to meet some form of quota.

A bad movie is a bad movie. Stupid dialogue, bland story, plot holes, unconvincing acting, those are the reasons why a movie is bad. It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the demographics and what gender is the main character. But choosing women character or gender swapping for the sake of it, and forced blatant message about girl-boss or men are animals with bad writings do help in making a movie more obviously worse.	['Really? Because plenty of bad movies make money. Twilight made money. Grown Ups made money. Transformers made money.', 'And in this case, this movie is both bad and unpopular.']

Also, women who liked action, heroes, sci-fi and fantasy already liked them as they were. One thing I am concerned about is that we will see a complete 180 shift. Which I can understand some people would feel justified with. But which I don't think is the best way forward for good storytelling.	[]

"What these folks do not grasp is that stories are born from underlying archetypes that are present in wide swaths of people. You might get someone to watch something outside of their regular wheelhouse, but you will generally not make them the primary audience for something if that something is not at their core.

Men are interested in creating things and saving people.

Women are interested in building interpersonal relationships and nurturing people. 

That doesn't mean men only think of the first two while women think of the latter two. But it does mean that if you use saving the world as the catalyst of a film, it's men who will be drawn in as that is their power fantasy.

What's women's? Beauty and the Beast. It offers the adventure, magic, mystery and discovery of the above type of film, but the core is about a complex relationship between two people exploring whether / why they should get together. 

Instead of Madam Web, they should've made something more akin to Kate and Leopold if they wanted a female focused story with pulp fiction (in that case time travel) element.

But they can't do that anymore because straight romance is forbidden in modern Hollywood unless it's being deconstructed."	[]

It's nice to see you guys have faith they'll change. Even if they try, there's barely any talent left from actors to directors.

wonder woman shows a female superhero movies can totally work. The problem is they are focusing more on making a political statement than they are on a good movie. If they put the concept first, then they can go back to drawing in more fans, both male and female.	"['Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm big on Greek Mythology', ""@@gianthand8130 me neither, but you didn't really have to know any to enjoy the movie. You hear the villain is the god of war, you can get the gist""]"
"Remember I said this on this video: Hollywood is going to keep releasing woke bullshit and when the profit losses are so bad that the major studios fall into danger of having to shut down they will go into what men have built in the underground and try to steal it so they can ""revitalize"" Hollywood with it. MARK MY WORDS. Look at how the AAA game studios are already scrounging around for non-woke titles on Steam and GoG as a way to validate themselves with everyday gamers. They've also started to go back to more macho brutal violence and teen-like toilet humor with some titles. They'll do the same with film, WATCH."	[]
They don‚Äôt get it. Women don‚Äôt want to be the boss. They want to be a girl or female boss. Unwittingly showing they don‚Äôt understand the term ‚Äòboss‚Äô.

"The girlbosses one weakness.

"Woke hollywood and girlboss writing hit the worst wall anything related to women and women's obsession with baiting/trolling men for self-validation can hit - men stopped caring. Look at the numbers for anti-woke media youtube channels, they're in collapse. The Quartering, all the other anti-woke grifters, Disparu, Styx....it's all going to shit. Even TCD is leaking views . 

Men have quit. We let hollywood and the wokists do what they want, we stopped complaining and we stopped getting triggered at ever gender swap flop of a film they release. We moved on without lives and interests since wasting our lives bitching about feminist film flops is not a way to live. Notice how relatively little hate Madame Web got compared to the last 2 years of woke bullshit. Again, men just lost the energy to care or fight - women HATE that. Expect some sort of big story of male abuse to come out that allows the argument to flare up again."	[]
Studios have spent a lot of time and money making superhero and action movies for women. I wonder why they're not focused on making romantic comedies for men.	[]
I have no problem with female leads, if they are well written. The 'girl boss' archetype for superhero movies seems to make them strong from the get go with some sort of compulsion to compare themselves to their male counterparts (She-Hulk for example). The males on the other hand mostly started with no power or no control (Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner) or had to work and build their strength (Iron Man). It's no fun having a character who has all of that at the start with no development. Even Thor had serious development despite being seriously powerful already.	[]
"Them using ""Girls made this so girls will want to see this"" would be the same brain dead logic as saying ""Guys made this so guys will want to see this"". 
Guys don't watch stuff cause guys made it and want to support their fellow guys. Guys watch stuff because its good.
And girls are saying ""This shit is trash, stop making trash"" by not showing up, and I'm glad. Because its women exploiting women when they say ""You don't support women by not showing up"""	[]
100% REAL TALK	[]
Honestly I've dumped enough money in to this woke bullshit. I likely will not be partaking in new cinematic venues anytime in the near future even if they fix their approach. They need to learn their lesson to the dire extent so this garbage doesn't happen again. Can we all agree to boycott any and all cinema box offices for the next two years? Note: It's not that I care who plays the lead role, but the utter perfect female leads and the 'women can do anything men can, but better' is just annoying. I am glad to see they've lost millions / billions over this trash.	[]

Yeah... Like I recognize that Titanic is a great movie... Don't get me wrong I watched it once and found it kinda uninteresting, being interested in history I found it to be 75% made up and 25% actually realistic, I found the characters boring, monotone and predictable (and horny... don't forget horny) - and a ton of the decisions made in the movie were to put it mildly moronic and unrelatable. You do realize that Rose is a giant D to her fianc√© right? Like actually she is not a nice person and in record time wants to bang someone else and Fs off to do crap with him (Because she's horny remember?) I literally will never watch it again! The clips of the somewhat realistic animations of the ship sinking is all I need from that movie TBH! STILL - I recognize that it's a great movie! It's just not a movie made for me!	[]

"""65% to 70% of the superhero audience in NA""........ Erhm..... NO! That number is HIGHER - by a fair bit. The vast majority of women who get tickets to see these movies - are there because their boyfriend/husband wants to see it and that's ""part of the deal"" for him sitting through what she wants to see. I think I personally know about 5 women who would MAYBE go to watch a superhero movie out of their own interest - maybe - the rest are there because that's what the guy wanted to watch and she has her phone out for a fair bit of it! LOL I bet you that number is 90% to 95% - at best!"	[]

"I like to look to Captain Janeway from Star Trek Voyager on how to do a female lead properly in male targeted properties. 

Firstly. They didn't beat you over the head about her being a woman. Sure they acknowledge it, but they don't go out of their way to remind you every chance they get. Secondly. She needs the men of her crew and uses them equally or even better than the women of her crew. She is easily hardest on Seven and B'Elanna. While her number 1 confidant is a male vulcan, her first officer is a man, the first person she recruits in the show is a toxic male inmate who has been cast aside by everyone. Thirdly. She doesn't try to be Jim Kirk or Jean Luc Picard. Does she carry some of their traits? Yes. She is a captain and she acts like it. But while both of those men use Masculine energy to lead their respective crews, Janeway ultimately falls into leading with feminine energy and basically becomes the ship's mother... In a good way. I've always said that between those 3 captains, the one I'd feel most comfortable going to with a personal or professional problem would be Janeway... And that's how I should feel. Women should be easier to approach with things like that. Finally, she is likable!! She is a badass and she is inspiring. Is her character written perfectly? Nah. Not really. But Kate Mulgrew did her damndest to make sure the character always had charm, even when the writing was on the weaker side at times. You can't say the same thing about the vast majority of these girl boss characters."	[]
When will feminists accept that most females like watching feminine women doing feminine things????	[]
"I don't mind ""girl bosses."" What I can not stand are the insufferable, unrelatable, aggressive female characters that are awkwardly compelled to crap on male characters as frequently as possible. 

What made me wake up and realize we had a problem was the scene in Infinity Wars where all the female heroes gathered center screen to fight. 

An EQUAL balance of bad ass men and women is superior cinema"	[]
Sydney Bristow, Buffy, Quake, Electra, Black Widow (before her movie), Carrie Mathison from Homeland. All INCREDIBLE girlboss characters. They need to stop trying so hard to tick boxes and just write natural like they used to	[]
Even the uber macho Rocky and Rambo had to over come the odds, poverty, fear and self doubt to win by sheer grit as the underdog.  That makes a character relatable.	"['Rocky also had support from a loving, devoted Adrian who underwent personal growth from a shy, docile servant of her brother to an outgoing, confidant individual to where she snapped Rocky out of all that fear and self-doubt plaguing him in the third film.', 'Seeing you use ""uber"" in context made me a little nostalgic... \nThank you old sport', 'This.', '\u200b@@jwill6008 Gatsby? üòÆüòÆüòÆ', 'RCU > MCU']"
Probably the best female action character that I have seen is Ripley from Aliens: likable, relatable, resourceful and courageous, not because she is not scared...but because her cause leaves her no choice but to rise to the occasion despite her fear.  This is someone that audiences can relate to, and like, and cheer for.  Not some obnoxious Girl Boss superhero who had everything handed to her because she is female.	"['Yeah, this girlboss stuff just reads as... what do the gender-studies people call it... ""internalized misogyny"". Apparently strong women have to be nonhuman and not experience human challenges and problems, because allegedly human women can\'t overcome them like men can! :P', 'another one is Cat Tully from GOT.. she fucks up constantly but still has good qualities as well', 'I think that is the problem we have these days.  They write in tropes, rather than creating human, relatable characters.  In days gone by, we didn‚Äôt worry about whether the character represented us by label, but rather whether the character represented humanity.  It‚Äôs why some films that seem to appeal to men on paper, like Gladiator, are so popular.  The characters appeal to all human beings, not just a subset.  I think it is indicative of the greater problem of people only seeing people who look or act like them as human.', ""Check out Blue Eye Samurai.\nI promise it's not weeb nonsense.""]"

"Silk will still flop, the only way you're getting male attention to a female superhero-lead show/movie is when the character is actually popular. If they made a Black Cat show, or even a Mary Jane show, people would pay attention because these characters are actually popular from the comicbooks. 

Silk is a D-list Spider-Man ally/antihero/whatever. Scew the scrips how much you want, this won't do crap. The only way it will be successful is if it's like perfectly written, and the word-to-mouth is that you HAVE to watch this show.

That graph was super interesting that comedy skewed most to young women, i wouldn't have picked that one. I wonder if that's always been that way, or its due to the fact 'comedy' is getting so woke now a lot of young guys are tuning out. I would think in the 2000's with will farrel, adam sandler, movies like superbad, american pie etc it would have skewed more male. I genuinely tried to give the marvels a go, as the first one was boring. Turns out 3 'leading' roles just makes a move 3 times more boring, and 3 times less content. They spent so long trying to cover all 3 characters nothing actually happened in the movie....Why must women write so many 'lead' roles...are they saying a single woman cant handle it? It's very odd to me....a good movie only needs one main character, how else is there enough time for them to even progress or develop?	[]

"You don't need to force an entire movie or even character to be themed about female empowerment to have good female empowered in a story. That is what these all get wrong. The audience doesn't need to be told ""wow look at this strong woman"" to see a strong female character. In fact it has the opposite effect, people are told to think something, they will hate it by simply because they were told they should like it.

Look at Alien. It released in 1979, has a strong female lead, and yet everyone watching it saw a great classic sci-fi. Women were empowered by the actresses performance, and the male audience didn't even notice or care it _wasn't a man_ because the story doesn't force the fact that she's a woman and strong onto the audience. All you need to do is tell a great story, have compelling characters, the gender of them is important but it's not a message to tell the audience for a agenda to force onto people."	[]

3) represent ""desired behaviours"" by showing them positively rewarded in fantasy

"Alright, folks, let's talk about a figure who's been stirring up controversy in the online community: the one and only Critical Drinker. Now, if you're not familiar with him, consider yourself lucky. But for those who have had the misfortune of stumbling upon his channel, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the rabbit hole of toxic masculinity and regressive attitudes.""

First off, let's address the elephant in the room: the Critical Drinker's penchant for belittling and demeaning anyone who doesn't fit into his narrow definition of 'manliness.' From his condescending rants about 'girl power' to his dismissive attitude towards female characters in film, it's clear that he's stuck in a bygone era where misogyny was the norm and empathy was in short supply.""

But here's the real kicker, folks: despite his claims of being a 'rational' critic, the Critical Drinker's views are anything but. They're steeped in outdated stereotypes and fueled by a toxic cocktail of insecurity and resentment. And let's not even get started on his taste in whiskey.""

So, to all you disciples of the Critical Drinker, I have just one thing to say: it's time to wake up from that hangover and smell the coffee. The world is changing, and clinging to outdated notions of masculinity isn't just uncool, it's downright insulting to your own self respect. It's time to embrace diversity, empathy, and respect for all individuals, regardless of gender.""

So here's to progress, here's to equality, and here's to all the voices out there who refuse to be silenced by the likes of the Critical Drinker. Keep speaking out, keep challenging the status quo, and together, we can build a future where everyone feels valued and respected. Cheers to that."	[]
üôÑ There is no problem with 'girlboss' just make a good show with a girl as the boss. What you dont do is virtue signal I gues and play into the B.S going on in society.

"something worth noting is that the marketeers tend to market to men and women differently, particularly by putting something into one catagory, rather than another depending on the gender they are marketing to.

For example, my wife and I both love sci-fi, fantasy, and romance books. we both read novels based on 1, 2, or all 3 genres, but depending on the author and the subject, the ones recommended to her are named ""romance"" first and foremost, with fantasy/sci-fi as additions; while the books recommended to me by the algorithms are sci-fi/fantasy first with romance elements.

but the consistent thing is that if the story, characters, or writing are bad, they are bad books. doesn't matter the writer's gender or the ratio of men to women.

Also, my favourite writer is a woman that writes spec-ops sci-fi novels, and she adds romance elements into them and a generally even cast of genders. and she does all the elements wells"	"['nice info', ""Not saying the author's name is borderline illegal"", 'Are you talking about the lunar chronicles?', 'Giving such an awesome sales pitch and then not including the name of that spec-ops sci-fi author is SO MEAN!

"Outline for new blockbuster super hero movie:
Opening scene: generic bad guys pilfering semi dark warehouse when generic girl boss super hero drops down in the ridiculous knee crushing 3-pt landing. Bad guys freeze in place, shocked and scared, caught red handed. Girl boss approaches slowly expounding bad assey threatening dialogue when behind her drops down (on two feet knees absorbing drop) heretofore unknown bad guy who then quickly overpowers smaller female girl boss foe. After assailing her for a solid two minutes with actual fighting techniques not cgi or wire stunts, he kneels over her and monologues for a bit before snapping her neck. 

Next scene: male super hero watches news report about girl boss death while reporter uses exposition to explain that he had been sidelined and back burnered in his role as main super hero due to society's female centric super hero push. Movie then introduces lesser female super hero who had was not as attractive or as infallible as main girl boss and therefore had been overlooked while she actually was the superior fighter of the two. Then she joins forces with male super hero as his sidekick to take on bad guy."	[]

It's crazy that the execs running Hollywood didn't know what they were doing was box office suicide. Even years ago. There has been a holywood formula that caters to the masses not pandering to fringe groups and minorities because appealing to a general audience is what made Hollywood the giant industry it was for over a 100 years. It's crazy to think that women  not giving a shit about marvel or star wars being a revaluation is absurd.  Anyone who has any women in their life knows they would rather watch bridgerton or love island or some reality series than the latest black widow or Rey Skywalker. The me too and BLM movements scared Hollywood into placing in competent people in charge of making movies and it has led to a complete disaster. Hopefully the shareholders will come to their senses and put people in charge that know what they are doing.	[]
"God, when will they learn, that the male audience is what makes up MOST of the Marvel/DC fanbases? Just catering to one specific demographic, especially one that isn't even all that into that respective genre, is just going to cost them money. Just make a movie that caters to EVERYONE, or at least, an character that people actually care about and are interested in. Not this same nonsense of, ""we have a female lead, an all female writing team, and a female director"", because no one gives a damn at the end of the day; especially the people they're catering to."

"My wife is in those 30% of women in the audience for SciFi and Action movies, and she doesn't like the girl boss characters any more than I do. So these writers arent even writing for the existing female fans of the genres. 

They seem to be writing for the women that dont take an interest in these movies and would rather go watch Barbie."	[]
"I used to watch so many movies growing up especially comedies but now 90% of movies are just cringe people forcing what they think is ""right"" for people to watch or laugh at, which basically amounts to watered down versions or just straight copies of the old material with a women slapped on top no effort whatsoever. Make something entertaining again or at least new."	[]
You guys do what you want to do. If last 5 years have taught me anything, it's that Hollywood is dead, I dont plan to go to cinema any time soon when there's so much old content to go through.

Its not even the characters per se. Its the awful portrayal and interactions. Almost all of the heroines are belligerent and unlikable. For example captain marvel. Make her hot, witty, accurately strong per comic canon and fans would love her. Female comic superheroes have always had bodies like goddesses with personalities across the gamut. But they are probably 90% or more smoke shows. Unrealistic, yes. But so is Thor.  Hemsworth is perfect. Scarlett was a perfect black widow. But from there it all went downhill fast. The crusty people on Twitter, Disney acquiesced,  and the heroes of marvel became Much more average pretty fast. Then there is the personality or lack thereof, and interactions...  Thor and captain marvel for example could have had a bit of a rivalry to determine who was stronger rather than turning Thor into the dude and having her tank thanos entire armada. Canon had Thor being true to his moniker and rivaling even galactus in strength, while being not the sharpest tool in the shed. Marvel was *almost* as strong, but a good step behind him. However, she was a better tactician and planner as well as being more fast most of the time. She was also likeable and sometimes funny. Not a condescending cxnt. I could do this all day but I won't.

Tomboys are a thing, but they have been grossly overrepresented. I remember 20 years ago or so they had the occasional media with a girl in a superhero outfit. This was all and good, it was uncommon, but you would see a girl or two trick or treating as spider man for halloween, even 20-30 years ago. I'd say you still see about the same ratio of girls wearing boys costumes today, and even after 20 years of this propaganda.	[]
"There's an old movie that I think did get the balance between romance for women and action for men to work:

""Hanover Street"".
(SPOILER ALERT)
WWII bomber pilot Harrison Ford falls in love with the breathtakingly beautiful Lesley-Anne Down in London.
Problem is Christopher Plummer, her spy-training husband.
So she has an affair with Ford who's exciting and dashing and etc compared to her ""pleasant"" husband.
Unfortunately, Ford falls in love with her (who the hell wouldn't??) which makes him timid and paranoid about getting blowed out of the sky.
Also unfortunately, the Nazis keep catching Britain's spies. And the latest that Plummer is training just isn't getting it.
So he decides to go himself.
To ensure security, a night drop over Germany from a B-17... guess whose B-17...
So as they're flying over Germany, the Germans decide ""nah, can't have that"" and blow them out of the sky.
The only two survivors, wouldn't you know, are the two men in love with Lesley-Anne Down (least believable part of the movie; every man she meets has to fall in love with her...)
So she's back home waiting word with her daughter, and she finds out who the bomber pilot is, and is both distressed and comforted; thinking she was being punished for her adultery, and thinking that Harrison will get her husband through it alive.

So, Plummer owies his ankle and needs help completing his mission. They pick up a uniform for Ford from a French underground girl whose brother is a Vichy pig, courtesy of the German she killed while they were hiding in her barn.

And they go to Nazi HQ (of course) but the safe they're supposed to get the list of British spies from (and plant a fake list in) is changed. Plummer doesn't know how to open it. As they're driving to the HQ, Plummer explains that he took this mission because he's always been ""pleasant"". And he's worried he's losing his wife because of it, so he wanted to do something dramatic.
He tells Ford that Ford is a natural hero; he's the guy who saves the boy who falls through the ice; Plummer's the guy who gives him his coat to wrap around the boy. Afterwards, Ford would be hailed a hero, and get the girl... and Plummer would have a wet coat.

They go back to Nazi HQ that night and everything goes wrong, but they get away after making the swap...

There's an interlude where the two are in the French barn, and they get to talking... and Ford finds out that it's this guy's wife he's schtuping (that's Yiddish for boinking, I believe). 
So the French girl's rat-bastard brother has finked on them, and here come the Nazis. But, the French girl says there's a resistance cell a few miles away across a bridge, and they will help them.
They escape, chased by the aforementioned Nazis, and as they're crossing the bridge... Plummer is hit... and then the mortars the Resistance are using break the bridge, and Plummer is about to fall to his deadness. Ford tries to save him, Plummer tells him to go on, and asks him to tell his wife he tried to be brave, and Ford gets pissed and saves him anyway. 
They get to the other side with the Resistance providing cover, and Plummer says, rather sadly, ""Looks like I get the wet coat again""
To which Ford replies, ""No. This time you get the girl"".
Cut to: Lesley finds out that they're rescued and rushes to the hospital. She runs into Ford coming out of Plummer's room, and there's a teary scene where Ford tells her that Plummer's a good man, and he's got to go on and she's got to go to Plummer. And it shows Ford crossing the street alone.. The End.
(SPOILER OVER)

I like the ending, but I loved the whole alpha male / beta male dichotomy. And they didn't run it into the ground; sure Ford was the hero most of the time, but Plummer was the man in charge at Nazi headquarters; he was the one who was in his element.

But the thing about the movie that makes me sad is that it's the kind of movie you can watch with your girl (and you'll probably get laid afterwards). It has the romance she wants, the action you want, and a story that weaves the two together in a way that makes sense.
(It makes me sad because, while I have a wet coat, I have no girl...)

So it CAN be done; you CAN appeal to two different demographics if you do it right. I don't know how it did at the box office, but it was a good, entertaining popcorn flick."	[]
What they are trying to do is sell a treadmill to a person who is wheelchair bound with the impression it will help you walk.	[]
"So, is the problem with those movies the fact that they failed to attract a wider female audience (understandable! Not all girls are into superhero genre, no matter the characters or the cast), the fact that apparently male audience gave up the moment they heard about the fem!superhero movie, or the fact that they are badly written? Because, from the reactions I observed all of the above apply simultaneously, while honestly only the third option should be the reason they flopped. On another note, as a woman I'm not sure if ""all-female"" superhero movie is even something other fangirl are all that interested in. We usually want normal superhero movies, just with *more* female characters. Give me Avengers where there is someone else than one Black Widow (compared to her, what, five or six male companions)!"

The Barbie movie was in fact targeted to a female audience but...the most enjoyable and popular part of the movie was Ken.	[]
The sad part that Woke hollywood feminists failed to realize was, men always had no problem with female led movies, we loved them when they are written well. Think of Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Alien, Halloween, etc there have always been strong feminine women leading male dominated movies and shock horror men and women loved them because they were written well, they had traits of masculinity without foregoing their femininity and didnt try put down their male counterparts or try to be the strong female character she was always meant to be	[]

There's more to it. But yeah, the center of it all, lo and behold, money. The big businessman only look at the surface and don't have any depth towards what common folks like. So they thought the critics to it, mostly via the internet (because it's where most communication about stuff like this happens) were just being noise and nuisance. It took way more time than I thought, but I expect things to come around. Even Netflix, as a broken clock that only works 2 times out of 24, is getting better.

"All of these superhero movies were a potential cash-cow for the film makers. They had a ready-built comic book fan audience that was practically chomping at the bit to see these movies. Then the political idiots in management decided to push the Feminist -""Woke"" Agenda with overpowering injections of ""cultural diversity"" (race-swapping characters, gender-swapping characters, inserting LGBTQ themes not necessary to the story, and pushing the ""anti-Patriarchal ((AKA ""Anti-Male"")) Agenda"") and now the movies that could have been superheroic masterpieces have become steaming piles of cinematic shite.

 As a comic book fan, I was SO DISAPPOINTED in the vast majority of the movies after Avengers Endgame that I have given up even trying to watch them. I long for the days of watching good movies like Captain America: Winter Soldier, or even the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies. The worst of those movies is still better than pure garbage like The Eternals, Black Panther 2, and several other piles of crap produced by the MCU. Even the Nicholas Cage ""Ghost Rider"" movies are masterpieces compared to the recent MCU movies.

The only place where I differ from the Critical Drinker is his dislike of She-Hulk. Yeah, the humor was very dry, and sometimes it was condescending towards men. The writers appeared to know very little about superhero legal stuff. If the writers had simply read the comic series by Dan Slott and Peter David, there would have been a ton of funny material to draw from. But it appears they did not do so. But the main star (Tatiana Maslany) carried a lot of weight, played her part well, and there were some funny moments. So, although it was not the disaster some people think, it could have been so much funnier if the writers had done their research. But I think they might have gotten over-confident and lazy. I would LOVE to see a better-written (and funnier) Season 2 of She-Hulk"	[]

Lots of women like superhero movies. What Hollywood fails to remember is that most straight women like strong capable men. We go to superhero and actions movies for that strong hot heroic man archetype and we watch the chick flicks for the sexy romantic man archetype. This is why we prefer our superhero movies to not be void of that classic archetype that I described above. Going to a superhero movie with just women in it‚Ä¶is on the fantasy level‚Ä¶a huge let down. Men like to imagine they can be as strong as the superhero and women like to imagine they can be saved and wooed by that superhero. These are truths what will always remain and that‚Äôs why an all female superhero movie doesn‚Äôt fair well with the majority of audiences.	[]

Movies and TV shows used to be about escaping the real world for a little bit. They were a couple hours we could spend without worrying about societal problems. Now they fully inject all the problems and issues into the entertainment and never give us a chance to wind down and relax. We need an avenue to step away from everything and refresh. I hope cinema gets back to that way of operating.	"[""Yeah it's why I have increasingly looked back for entertainment."", 'Movies have always been political.

Valid point that they\'ve always existed. I don\'t think your comment is as poignant as you think it is. My point is, so many movies and shows shove the same narrative down everyone\'s throats. Why does every female lead have to be better than her male counterpart? Speed was a great movie with well written male and female leads. Terminator had a message but was also entertaining AF. Children of Men has a strong political message but has fully fleshed out characters. I don\'t give a crap if there is a message to art, I prefer it. But I want it to be done well. None of this bullshit that\'s coming out now is done well. It\'s strictly a device to push propaganda.

"I honestly don't care whether the female heroes are ""balanced by equally strong and capable male heroes"". Not one bit. I never really specifically identified with a particular hero because I shared genitals with them, or skin color, or anything really. I care about the hero's personality, goals, methods and ethics.

Throw a million movies with female leads at me if you like. But make these female characters believable. Make the entire setup believable. Make the movie feel like a genuine artistic endeavor rather than like some kind of cheap twitter politics lecture, and I won't care at all about ""representation"" because that never mattered to me at all anyway. But naturally, you'd expect that if the people making the stuff don't care about representation either, then by sheer force of statistics, we'll end up with interesting characters of all genders anyway."

"All these dumbass producers need to do is walk into a comic store (if they can find one), card shop, or anywhere that is considered a ""nerdy"" type store and look around at the demographic. Easily 80-95% of it will be male, and the people in these stores are the ones willing to travel or leave there house for a reason. I mean girls are in the nerd culture BUT that is a minority. Not a big enough minority to make a 100+ million dollar movie cause that's a bad investment. Why did early superhero movies make so much money? Answer: Children. Kids like action and a cool looking suite. Don't know jack about the character before hand but it looks cool. Majority of super hero movies back then got mixed reviews by the nerd culture cause loss of accuracy and deviation from the stories they grew up on. Now after so many superhero movies its now not special, and no one cares to go out of their way to watch them. I wonder what's the next movie trend."	[]

To me, it seems that the audience they are trying to appeal to doesn't exist. On the one hand many women are just not interested in this kind of content, while on the other, the women who ARE interested in this kind of content are probably full-on fans who resent the  'rebalancing' of their favourite franchises as much as the male audience does. Ergo, the only people interested in this crap are 'activists' who aren't really interested in the content at all but just want their opinions to prevail over everyone else's.

As a woman myself, I appreciate a good story more than the who leads the cast  male or (but especially) female.

Such poor handling of such strong comic character, it‚Äôs incredibly disheartening. 

I‚Äôm not going out of my way to see a female led movie just because it‚Äôs a female led movie. Nor will I go out of my way to see it because it was directed by a female or has an all female led cast.

WE WANT GOOD STORIES."	[]
As a woman it annoys my that Hollywood seems to think what we want is a film full of women achieving impossible feats all on their own. There‚Äôs definitely a place for strong female characters but they have to feel believable and work with a good story. These superhero  films ‚Äòtargeted at women‚Äô are just objectively bad. There‚Äôs definitely more room for empowered women in the older, male-dominated films, but I think generally, and for me personally, I just like to see believable and relatable women who aren‚Äôt being mis-treated or condescended (unless it is a plot point). I like many of the older superhero films because they were just objectively good but if someone isn‚Äôt into superhero films, they‚Äôre likely not going to go and see one just because it‚Äôs got female leads	[]
"Whenever I hear, read, or see a girlboss, ""Hannie Caulder,"" an old movie I saw long ago comes to mind.  Raquel Welch plays the title character.  She's NOT a Mary Sue.  The character has much more in common with Luke Skywalker and Connor MacLeod than She Hulk or Captain Marvel.  Hannie Caulder has survived brutal crimes against her and needs a mentor in the vein of Obi Wan Kenobi and Ramirez.  She is not instantaneously infinitely skilled.  Even after she's trained by Robert Culp's Luther Price, she's not stronger and faster than the men.  She's still a woman and vulnerable, but believably deadly with an appropriate weapon."	['That is why it appealed to both women and men.  The story arc, revenge, protection, and redemption, is one that appeals to everyone.  You look at films like Gladiator, or Alien, who had strong support but people on the whole, and it comes down to believable characters, and interesting well told stories.']

The problem isn't not making movies clearly for women or men. Good movies resonate with everyone. Barbie attracted loads of male audience. Lotr attracted a shit ton of female audience. These Girlboss movies are simply bad movies. As a feminist, I think they are shit because Hollywood isn't actually liberal or progressive. They are just trying to appear so to get money from an audience they deem to be too stupid to tell the difference. There is no soul or actual understanding of anything behind these movies. That's why they are so hollow and bad. A Barbie movie with spectacular action scenes would be epic if it's made to the same standard as Barbie was. A movie about a female pilot struggling with her career while maintaining a family could absolutely be an amazing movie if it's well made. It wouldn't be a Top gun movie, obviously, but would be its own thing. It's bizarre that anyone thinks Hollywood is feminist. They simply switched from one type of caricature of women to the next. Girlbosses are just toxic masculinity hiding behind a female wrapper. The idea that women are only worth anything if they out-man the men is the least feminist thing possible.	[]

nice to see CD finally admit he got it wrong about Barbie, as did all the right wing culture warriors who were rubbing their fingers with glee believing it was going to be a huge flop. which kind of shows that it's not about politics; it's about good or bad story telling, and - as CD says - giving your audience what they want. it's a shame about Madam Web because they missed a huge opportunity to base the film on the original SpiderWoman, Jessica Drew - she has a mutation which makes her completely repellent to other human beings (that sounds like a joke in light of Miss Marvel and Rey Skyflopper, but it made her a genuinely interesting and tragic character)	[]

"As a female who likes scif, fantasy, and superhero movies I can say that the worst way to attract/keep female audience is by creating a terrible movie with a pompous, arrogant, Mary Sue female lead while insulting and degrading all the cool characters we liked in the past. 

Want a female lead look toward the first two Terminator movies, or the first two Aliens, or many of the coleads/ensemble casts in movies prior to the current itteration of movies. You could have even had a female lead in Star Wars if you did not take a dump on the original characters and made her someone that learned from them.

Yes in general women like other genres but the women who like this genre liked how it was. Sure introduce cool female characters like Storm and Rogue but they dont need to be better or one up Cap and Stark. They dont need to take over and we dont need them all being besties, eating cake, giggling and talking about how the boys are so dumb. That just makes them dumb (she hulk tv show most freaking insulting thing ever).

Why does a fictional female character need to have ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù abilities? Why can‚Äôt the reason why ‚ÄúThe Marvels‚Äù and ‚ÄúMadame Web‚Äù suck is due to studio interference and incompetent, meddling studios executives chasing a fat check. 

Women love fantasy. ‚ÄúHermione Granger‚Äù from Harry Potter is a Balanced, likable, book-smart and intuitive female lead. Belatrix is a great and humorous hence-woman to Voldemort. Professor Mcgonagall is the second best professor in the whole series, after Snape. 

Those ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù films made millions for Lionsgate, and their female lead. 

Overpowered women aren‚Äôt the problem. Bad writing is."	[]
"Movies from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s knew how to portray strong, female characters who were strong in many ways OTHER than physical strength.  They certainly had other issues, but they were relatable, original, and they were willing to learn and better themselves (just like the male characters).  Older movies embraced EQUALITY; not Socialist-based ""equity"".  Unfortunately, today's Leftist ""activists"" will never go back to that because it contradicts their false narrative...which is why they need to be purged from every facet of society and government immediately."

BRAVER: A Tale of the Afterlife is coming out this month, to Amazon and Kobo, possibly more book platforms later.

Here's the synopsis:
Ben Freeman, a videogame concept designer, is placed in charge of the Craig Manor, a 19th century house with a dark past, where he is expected to develop the latest survival horror title for his company. Grieving his late mother and socially despondent, ready to give up on our World... Until a fated confrontation with the World of the Dead. Between the forces of Darkness and the healing of the Light, he finds in others what he had lost: Love and Hope.

On a Journey that spans the globe, meeting several timelines of human History, his newfound Family braves through countless horrors, which threaten both dimensions, armed with the power of imagination and reasoning, to create a place where the Dead may 'live' in peace. However, to navigate this strange and terrifying place, one must not lose their memories. For without those, Souls become broken and join the endless masses of shadows at the mercy of Despair, which had so far, ruled unchallenged.

This is the Story of the Heroes who changed the Afterlife, forever.
----

Go get it. Hope you enjoy it this year, more to come in the coming years, for a full trilogy of spectral combat, lots of comedy, tears and good feelings, with strong admirable protagonists who regard Family as the highest value of the human condition. I'm building a full mythological take on the Afterlife where the Mother is the spiritual core of our species and it is those qualities in a woman that make her powerful, admirable and lovable. And I think it's about time we start having that conversation about motherhood, even if fantasy is the way to get the foot through the door. Support my work and I'll help steer this stuff in the right direction.

I got a plan :)"	[]

"Saddest part is... this is so much of an missed Opportunity. 
having a precognitive blind Spider Woman is dope AF! think of the norns or moirai. But for a story that jumps in time to work you really have to put the brain cells in . You have think hard and sharp. But if you do. Results can be mind blowing expecially if you order the scenes backwards or not linear , or repeat them to show the different outcome of different decisions (Memento , butterfly effect, ) ... 


Just sad to waste such an opportunity.  

You could go all out with mythology ... having one girl being an Historian / Archelogist (seeing the past) one being some kind of hacker / influencer / trend chasing Profession (seeing the present) and lastly one who can predict the future (both with computer models and of course mystical powers or something) ... 

Hell they could even have had a super white old guy (Chronos) being allknowing and having him fail by choice because hes so f***** tired of an existence as omnisciencent ... 

So much you could do to.

"Since Final Fantasy 7 is getting it's second installment in the ""Re"" series (Which seems not to be Remakes), Tifa's breasts is once again the topic of discussion.
Let's ignore her breasts for once though. Because Tifa and Aerith are probably two of the best versions of female representation in entertainment. 
You have Tifa who on the surface is there as eye candy - as proven by all the discussion of her breasts - and yet she's such an endearing and caring character, very feminine and soft personality. But, she's also a kick ass and capable woman who runs a bar in the slums. A DIVERSE character because she has more than one dimension to her.
Then there's Aerith. Who on the surface looks like a damsel in distress. She looks vulnerable, and more geeky. Not really the ""eye candy"" (Although still very pretty). And yet, Aerith is a strong willed person - what I would call a ""strong female"" in that she doesn't act like a damsel in distress. She leaps into action, and tries to fix problems caused by her. She might not be physically strong, but that doesn't mean she isn't powerful in a feminine way.
The point is that the two women's personalities are the opposite of what their visuals would suggest, which makes them interesting. (Swap their bodies around and I think people would find both characters a lot less appealing).

So yeah, you can have strong women that are also feminine. People don't ""hate strong female characters"" they just hate characters that are just ""strong"" with nothing more going for them, and who happens to be a woman too.

I never hear a good movie that appealed mostly to men being highlighted by the fact that 'only' men worked on it.
A lot of the most successful movies had women touch at the very least in them and it always works best if the most capable people are actually working on it, or cooperating with each other instead of trying to push meaningless agenda.

The original Star Wars and George Lucas masterpiece, editor's was Marcia Lucas (n√©e Griffin) and lot people contributes big part of the success to her work.
We also had so many great female lead be it Sarah Connor, Ellen Ripley or perfect duos like Silence of the Lambs or Million Dollar Baby. And it works, it works great. 
Because the focus WAS the movie. 
Not checking some idiotic points such as color, gender or outright mental sickness and disabilities.

Younger women tend to be more sensitive to negative impacts and feel entitled to everything. After all, that's what has always happened for them.

I liked the female superheroes in the marvel movies, before they were just there to pander and push an agenda. Like it's fine if they have power and are cool, but there has to be a balance. And like the Star Wars movies, there is no balance. Instead of taking a mostly male franchise and flipping it to the other side, they should have focused on great stories and great character, both male and female ones. But instead they got rid of the males and and the ones left just became a joke. Also race swapping is some really racist crap. You notice how many redheads are disappearing from entertainment?	[]
This should be learned in schools. Thank you Drinker	[]
Women go and see superhero movies because they thing the guy in the movie is hot. End of story.	[]

"Mattel should make a movie called ""Ken"". Where Ryan Gosling, as Ken, leaves Barbieland, accepting her rejection of him, and explores other Mattel worlds. He meets G.I. Joe and Transformers, and learns about heroism, sacrifice, and doing what's right for the greater good."	"[""I'd watch the shit outta that. You wouldn't even have to lure me in with topless Ryan Gosling (which didn't work to get me to watch the barbie movie, and I like both Gosling and Robbie ... what a waste).""]"
"I sometimes wish they'd realize that women who watch superhero movies actually just want all the Chris's, Henry Cavill and Sebastian Stan in spandex. I don't want to watch a bunch of women being girl bosses. I just want beautiful, muscular men in spandex being Alpha males! I'm a WOMAN, which is why I watch Reacher for the plot. Sorry, the original MCU and Superman movies's greatest appeal were the handsome male actors, and that is why women watched them. Lord of the Rings had Aragorn and Legolas, and The Hobbit had Thranduil, and I know how you feel about the Hobbit, but you have to admit that Lee Pace is a great, and beautiful, fucking actor. So. Sorry. I don't want to watch feminist crap, I just want to be entertained.

Also In the original Star Wars movies what was better than Han Solo walking down there to get his medal from Leia and then winking at her! Just the way she smiled at that little wink was awesome. I loved Princess Leia for being sassy, and bossy and the way she just looked at Han Solo. I can fill up pages with things like this, and I think that's where Hollywood goes so wrong. They took the feminine out of feminine roles and made them... soooooooooooooooooooo boring. Also, oof, Harrison Ford still makes my little heart flutter."	[]

I get tired of paying money to sift through all the woke trash in movies. Top Gun Maverick was a good film but too many other movies that promise that type of action simply don‚Äôt. Instead they want you to pay money so they can show you just how much they despise you. I say Hollywood owes particularly straight white men an apology in the way of making films that cater to them for a while, say maybe a solid ten years. Hollywood hasn‚Äôt been very nice to us and I think they need to earn our respect again‚Ä¶or enjoy the empty seats!	[]
"I don't think the problem is female action leads, female directors, female writers or writers trying to cater to a female audience.  The problem is bad writing.  Madame Web could've been good if it made any fucking sense.  Instead they just thru some Spiderman adjacent shit into a blender and said ""Is this a movie?"""	[]
"It's a case of numbers.  Like a Ken doll.   Or Asia...
   If movie makes 5x on a film with a 70% male audience,  Theoretically there is a huge untapped female market with potential to make 7x if they can bring them in.
It's capitalism at work.  A part of it is definately annoying people sprooking ""the message"".  But it's mostly fat cats trying to figure out how they can make themselves fatter..."	[]
"The problem I have is that Studios don't consider the characters as characters anymore, nor do they treat the audience as humans with an actual brain.
Like, the character used to be relatable, a ""person"" who you can watch and grow feelings for because you can somewhat see yourself in said character, so when the finale hit, you can root for the character to win or becomes sadden in they lose, and this extends to the side characters and even the antagonist. But nowadays, main characters are just a stand in for a message they are trying to send and the other character either fall into ""also a message"" or cannon fodder to show case the message.
Then there's the aweful writing. Like I'm not in film school but I took a class or two on filming and one of the golden rules is ""Show don't tell"" because audiences do not like things being directly pointed out to them, also it hits harder when they do understand. But no, literally it's shoved down our faces and just in case we didn't get it the first thousand clues, they'll just directly say it on screen in some cases."	[]
Perhaps attempting to cater to target audiences is the problem. Whatever happened to... making good movies for the sake of making good movies?	[]
I just recently watched Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and the way Gwen and her story were portrayed was magnificent, how can they do that and also can't in other movies is baffling to me.	"['There\'s a catch, Gwen does mention how Miles ""can do whatever he wants"", just like that. So it remains to be seen how this trilogy is going to wrap things up, because Miles acts like a selfish asshole through the movie, meanwhile Gwen acts like a braindead fangirl, so it\'s a weird situation', ""@@RRRRRRRRR33  Indeed we need to wait how things will end up. I'll go to see it even if just for the visuals."", 'That movie needed more Diversity.', '@@scavysaimon2637 The visuals are mind blowing, they justify these animations already. But as a Spiderman story, Spiderverse 2 feels odd in my pov. A work in progress, the first Spiderverse was better structured, A to B, Miles learns to be responsible, to trust in himself, etc.. now it\'s a transition, to me Spiderverse 2 tried way too hard to be ""punk"", breaking the norms of the Spiderman characterization, the story is literally about two teenagers running away from home, no wonder there\'s a lot of ""contraversion"" in this movie']"
I say this as a woman. And this is a sweeping generalisation: women don't like women. They especially don't like 'girlbosses'. They want strong ass male characters. Eye candy. Confidence. Have they never grown up in school yards or offices where women can display the absolute worst, vile, nastiest bullying against other women?	[]
As a woman I only care for hot superheroes give me henry cavil I don't ask for much.	[]
"It's like no one in Hollywood learned the lesson of Arcane. You can have a bunch of dudes rooting for a lesbian slowburn romance and at the same time have a story and plot that also rings true with women. You just need good writing, conflict and characters. Arcane really stuck the landing there. Hell, Sabaton wrote a banger about the most decorated female soldier (Lady in the Dark), and no one complained that they were ""pandering"". 

If you tell an interesting story well, it matters not if the lead is a man or a woman, black or white. But if you emphasise these things, the result will be shit."	[]

"""that's like a vegan restaurant offering meat!""

That actually happened quite recently. Was in the news and everything. The owner was actually quiete reasonable about it too! Stating that while he doesn't eat meat he still has a business to run and his worker depend on him to provide them a paycheque. Actually felt a bit sorry for him as he seemed quite balanced about it all."	"[""It is doable, so I am upset people would believe it newsworthy like it's a revelation.

This video is brilliant.	[]

Has nothing to do between male and female. It‚Äôs just crappy writing. Every dude I know was super on board with black widow, which is a female lead obviously.

Because wonder woman and the first 3/4 of Black widow were legit good movies.	[]

Hey, my wife really enjoyed Maverick and the new Mission Impossible movies. Women also like spectacle, just a well executed one <3	['Yeah, we just like a little character with our Hulk smash.  Used to be that it didn‚Äôt matter the gender of the character but the story arc is what determined if it was aimed at men or women.  They also seemed to understand how to utilize the gray area, women who were physically weaker but strong of mind, men undergoing emotional transitions while being inherently men.  Alien, is as beloved by men as women.  Harry Potter same.  Both had interesting story arcs, character development, action that made sense, and human (flawed) characters.']

This female empowerment has gone too far, and I think it's time to end all of this pandering that Hollywood keeps barfing up. They need to cut out the crap, and start making movies that doesn't require girl boss characters.	[]
A movie can be unisex if it is truly good enough. The issue is that those movies dont come around every summer. Instead they are usually once in a generation type movies. Like trading places, forest gump, the original star wars, and super bad. There are more but the point is movies good enough to cross sexes also tend to cross cultural boundaries too. Its hard to due. Funny thing is those movies never set out to do that either. They need to stop trying to manipulate one group or another and just make a good movie. You'd be surprise at who shows up when its something worth watching. Look at moonlight. No one expected that but because people appreciated the story. So a movie about gay love got way more support from other communities.	[]
"It's not just that men like action movies with real men, women like those kinds of movies too - and for that matter, men can appreciate romantic comedies to some extent if they're well made too.  The sexes mostly enjoy in the ""thing"" of their sex, but the thing of the opposite sex is not totally alien to them either.  People are quite nuanced.  

However, genre product does still have to _mostly_ skew to the preferences of its biggest type of audience."	[]
"What's telling is that even though they continually try to make what used to be traditionally male movies attractive to a female audience, they never bothered to do the same with what were traditionally female movies.  Instead, they simply stopped making them.  When's the last time you saw a good romance or rom-com movie?

Because its not so much that they wanted to make movies that appealed to everyone.  They very openly didn't want to make movies that appealed to men.  That was it.  They said as much in multiple press releases and interviews.  And when you tell people thst you're intentionally NOT making something for them, guess what happens?"	[]

The real thing hollywood needs to do to stop the nosedive they are in is to just let old franchises die. We dont need anymore star wars, marvel, star Trek, Lord of the rings, dc, doctor who, ect. Those franchises have told complete stories. I dont think it  would matter if they got better writers or actors, or directors. It is time to let These franchises die to make way for something new. Dam near every interesting film that has come out in the past 5 or so years was made outside of hollywood for this very reason.	[]

I was truly hoping to hear they have NOT learned their lesson and would continue to push their pathetic products into the abyss with no hope of salvage.
I suspect the biggest culprits though, such as Disney, will barrel through and continue in their pathetic chase for the DEIA nirvana.
Which is great, as soon enough, they will slide into bankruptcy still thinking they did nothing wrong and it was the sexist - racist -  chauvinistic audiences fault for EVERYTHING.

"The big studios have clearly had a ton of pressure put on them to place a huge focus on politics and...yep, the Message. 

My theory is they saw how many people were seeing tentpole movies like Endgame and wanted to pull those same people into their agenda. This applies to Harry Potter also, with its creator leaping headfirst into the trans conversation and thus drawing the millions upon millions of Potter fans around the world into choosing a side, whether they liked it or not. All part of the plan IMO. Certain quarters have always hated how much kids loved Harry Potter. Even 20 years ago there were movements to burn all the books etc. This time they came for the fans in a different way. Ah well...!"	[]

Good grief. They may actually be realising who their audience is. Instead of virtue signalling into the void.	[]
"1) I thought Batgirl was supposed to be where the pendulum started to swing back.

2) As Drinker quoted Newton at the beginning, I'll paraphrase his first law.  ""An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.""  To liken this to the Superhero genre, they used to have objects in motion.  People would show up to an MCU movie solely BECAUSE it was an MCU movie.  Star Wars and Star Trek also had a similarly unstoppable motion.

Now?

Even if the pendulum swings back, it'll be an almost Sisyphean task to get that momentum back.  The momentum is gone and the enthusiasm is the proverbial boulder at the bottom of the hill.  Sure, I'll watch Venom 3 (even if Michelle Williams isn't in it).   The third Spiderverse movie is a definite must see.

But Kraven? Maybe?  
Deadpool 3?  I'll wait for reviews to see if Kevin Feige is smart enough to get out of Ryan Reynolds way.
Anything else MCU/Sony Marvel-related.  Meh.  Probably not.
The Gunnverse?  With this, the Boulder is made up of the materials that you find at the core of stars.  

Probably Joker Foile a Deux or The Batman 2 but those aren't part of the Gunnverse.  

While I didn't watch The Flash, I would have given a Sasha Calle Supergirl movie a fair shake.  But that's still not the Gunnverse.

The Gunnverse has the biggest hurdles to gaining any traction and, with the only thing that they have to recommend them is John Cena's Peacemaker, the future looks grim.

Star Wars:  They have Andor Season 2.  I admit that, out of all the other projects, the Rey Star Wars movie is probably the closest thing to me having any form of curiousity.

Star Trek: Lower Decks.  That's it.

All of these franchises have massive hurdles to get enthusiasm back much less get butts in theaters and seats."	[]

Random internet nobody here. Not a huge comic nerd - so the MCU was a big entry to me for many of these characters. I remember thinking this Robert Downey JR guy is way too full of himself - and his entire arc from start to sacrifice finish was beautiful. I remember thinking this Thor guy is so OP, nothing seems to stop him - then he was taught a lesson in humility by his father and what an arc he had from start to finish. So many of these characters were written with a goal in mind and a story to tell over many movies, and I really bought into the whole universe. Maybe I'm the problem though.	[]
The WNBA effect in movies. üòÇ	[]
As a female myself, I always thought the whole girlboss fad was lame and cringe. It can't die off fast enough. I love strong female characters, and many of my all time favorite 80s and 90s movies have such characters. Except back then, they still made them relatable and they were actually humans who made mistakes like everyone else. I'm just sick of today's female characters who have to be flawless and perfect all the time, which is not relatable at all.	[]

"They MIGHT be able to realign the paradigm but I think they did SO much damage to learn what the previous generation already knew that alot of people just don't care if they ""fix"" it now. Do you really think all these tyrannical and priviledged women in Hollywood are just going to say ""well, damn, we really screwed things up, here take back the keys because I was an idiot""? Next they'll just try to make romcoms called action movies. It will be The Notebook with a superhero who has to apologize for saving the life of the female star because he didn't ask to touch her first or something else just as stupid."	[]
"What a moronic take, as if Morpheus, Ant-Man, and Aqua man hadn't flopped just as hard, with a male-focused cast, male writers, and a male director. It's not about male versus female, its a about good versus acting, directing, and writing. The Eternals wasn't bad because it was overly female focused or ""woke"", it was bad being it was boring and didn't understand what made the comic book counterparts interesting."

I wish it was that simple. Unfortunately, I think the problem is much deeper than that, and you touched upon it in a previous video: filmmakers recently have no life experience. They also aren't nearly as literate. If they stopped being woke, not only they would have nothing to say, they still wouldn't know how to make good interesting films.	"[""A problem for them but not a problem. The people who know how to do this are still alive. Writers who are actually writers and not little girls who read the TVtropes website. (Actually frequent use of the word 'trope' is an excellent litmus test.)"", 'They wouldnt even have to come up with something new. There is so much existing material from great books. They would have just to follow the books. I think the problem is more that the filmmakers are not filmmakers, they are activists.']"

Can't blame men you have 50% of the world population being women. You could make massive amounts of billions of dollars if WOMEN cared to watch the movies and sports. They don't.
Yet here they are ruining franchises completely because apparently appealing to the RIGHT audience that has always been the main audience. AKA Males. Is somehow bad and sexist.
Why? No man out there is harping of forbidding Hollywood to make female romantic dramas that women love to see.  

They keep doing it. Disney is spearheading the downfall and they have replaced all their executives so no one there can even tell them, it's not working out.

I'd like to point out that there is some overlap -- women like me, who love sci-fi, fantasy, and action movies (as long as things are not too gory, because I'm a sissy) -- but I guess there are not enough of us to offer much support, AND we really do prefer great writing, original stories, and heroes who actually earn respect.

Fantastic vid, i agree with ever point but i think the one thing that trumps each genders preference is good quality film. Each gender most certainly has their preferences for what they like to see on screen but time and time again we can all come together and enjoy cinema if it is of high quality. I believe word of mouth is a highly powerful thing and alot of the time when I've been convinced to go see something i wouldn't otherwise see,;its because enough my peers have praised it highly. As you said, most women are already not enticed by the superhero genre and they definitely wont be if they've heard  that their all female cast superhero film is garbage. Take a look at everything everywhere all at once: absurdist physical comedy, heavy fight scenes and action, sci-fi premise but was still a smash hit across all audiences. I dont think anyone came to the cinema to see it because there was a female lead but because they had heard it was amazing. I think the real reason why the female oriented superhero films were such a failure was because they were just crap. And as the drinker said, it was already in a genre yhat doesn't appeal to women so they were already at a disadvantage challenging the status quo. It would be very interesting to see if women were now more interested in superhero movies had all these female led sci fi, fantasy and superhero media been of high quality. I would like to believe that there would have actually been a shift in interest because women would have more well written characters they can relate to and stories that resonate with them. As the drinker said, what's been actually made - doesn't appeal to anyone.	[]

It's probably a good thing that production times have gotten longer and more expensive for blockbusters. 2020 and beyond has been failure after failure totalling hundreds of millions in losses for the big budget studio wank fests and I think we're finally hitting the point where the powers that be HAVE to step back and rethink things.

"I was shattered to grounds when my daughter refused the original Star-Wars at the age of 8. I might give it a second try at the age of 12. If she still dont get the movie I need to make a new daughter.
She loves Ghostbuster though (the original). So not all hope is lost.

Also switching to economics: when you already have all the data about viewership on certain gengres available why the heck you place your bet on the 1% chance that it might hit? And also: It's not about sex. Alien was loved by audience and is a stable in my watchlist. Not because the leading character had a vagina, but the movie itself was great. And the leading actress was top notch in her role. Other examples where the plot and movie was great and featurted great women: Fith element; Silence of the lambs (and all the spawns); Contact; Arrival. 
So why so few: because women in general do not tend to cinema except ""sex and the city"". Take it or leave it."	[]

"The thing is, women know women, and women hate other women. There is nothing more catty and competitive to a cruel degree than that sex in particular. If women get into a hair pulling fight, they will grab, bite, pull hair, pull tits, bash, drag, and claw till someone pulls them away, or the other woman is unconscious, and even then the fight might keep going. Then they will hate and grudge against each other till the end of time. Guys on the other hand, will compete against each other, and when they get into a fight, will generally knock the other guy out, then maybe buy them a beer and become best buds afterwards. Respect is earned, the hierarchy is established and maintained, and peace is the end result. So movies about guys for guys tend to be better than movies about girls for girls. Okay, this may be ""sexist"" and may be a little gross exaggeration, but there is truth rooted in what I said. I'll just leave that here for all to digest a bit."	[]

"The thing to realise with Hollywood is that they benefit from movies no one wants to see. Producers and higher executives are paid using the film‚Äôs budget; it‚Äôs why they make disgusting amounts compared to the workers.  Doesn‚Äôt matter what it is; if the budget exists, they can pay themselves a bonus just for okaying the film. They push gender/race/regular politics because 1. It makes them look progressive and ahead of the curve to shareholders and 2. Because it‚Äôs so divisive now that it‚Äôs a great scapegoat for why films fail. The ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an ist‚Äù pejorative is a great way to excuse a film flopping which is why it became so popular, especially in 2019.  Anyone who complains about the film is made a scapegoat to hide shady tactics. Film budgets are exploding when film returns are diminishing simply because the higher the budget, the more they can pull in.

They‚Äôve set it up so, win or loose, they make fuck you amounts of money. If the film over-performs, good. More for them to divy up. If it flops, good.  They write it off and pocket a lot of what‚Äôs left because of how film studios work. Titanic and Jurassic Park are legally complete gongs because they were produced through shell studios that then sent all the money to Warner. Therefor, the films never made a penny. It‚Äôs a system designed to insulate the money and give little to the directors which is why horror stories of directors never seeing a penny for thier projects exist. Hollywood survives because of private capital, ignorant shareholders,and because they produce so much content that it‚Äôll make them profitable even if every single film they produce ends up like The Marvels. It‚Äôs called failing upward and it‚Äôs a disaster. 

Why does this problem exist? You can blame the collapsing middle class. In the 1920‚Äôs, anyone could make it on the stock market. Today, only the rich and richer can get anywhere due to the sheer price of stocks among other factors. How much control you have over a company is determined by the amount of shares you hold with the CEO almost always holding the most.. When the only people who can make it into movie studios are the ‚Äúget rich by cutting throats‚Äù type, creativity dies. As George Lucas once said ‚Äúcompanies used to be owned by people  who love film. Now they‚Äôre corporations. They don‚Äôt loves, they don‚Äôt go to movies. They don‚Äôt know what a movie is and they use focus groups to try to determine who will go see a movie. And Hollywood does that. They try to change the movie to fit what the polling was all about.‚Äù"	[]
The One Piece live action movie and Arcane are two perfect example of how diversity and strong female characters can be incorporated into a film without any of it being woke pandering.

I think I have a solution that can fix all the problems in modern media. Can we please stop getting bogged down in the politics of characters and just tell a good fucking story? Please? I get representation is super important to a lot of people but there is a point where you stuff in so much representation that the story meant to portray it is completely lost in the subtext. You want to have a Female Lead in your movie? Watch the Aliens franchise and learn from Ellen Ripley's example.	[]

"The ""girl boss"" trope is innately misandrist and has alienated the main audience for the films, resulting in commercial failure. The Barbie movie is also misandrist but appealed to the prejudice of its main audience and was spectacularly successful. The lesson is obvious: give audiences what they want and they will reward you handsomly, even if what you are selling is bigotry dressed as entertainment.

Sometimes audiences don't know what they want until they see it, which leaves room for experimentation, but how many times do you need to repeat an experiment to know that it is an abject failure?

"I also want to add something. I'm a woman and I LOVE Marvel films. I've been a fan since I was a kid in 2008 when Iron Man first came out. I also love all the ""male"" genres listed. And I know other women like me. We LIKE the qualities that make those movies good! I loved Barbie but I also love action films that are male-audience made like John Wick. What these studios fail to grasp is that women who actually watch the genre like, for the most part, every aspect of it. It feels weird when you make a female lead that acts like a male lead. I would love an amazing female-led action movie of some kind. But it is so weird for writers to impose male attitudes onto female characters. Women can't relate to perfect girlboss characters. The strongest women I've ever known, and most women know, are imperfect."	"[""One correction - the female doesn't ACT like the male lead. She just merely replaces him. And then they bring in the complexities of female issues into the role, and then it's not even an action movie.\n\nNo, they don't act or behave in any convincing fashion that they are like men. It just highlights the problems that arise when you bring in a woman to replace a man -- they're not interchangeable. Just like how you wouldn't want to see a man replace a woman in her role....it's just entirely unattractive.\n\nThere is no point in fixing what's not broken, and you'll never convince me that it was broken to begin with."", ""i wonder if a big piece of it is because although the demographic leans male, the movies themselves don't align with some sort of gender identity specifically the way that the newer pandering movies do. IE themes in Lord of the Rings may resonate with male audiences, but the movie isn't expressly trying to BE male, and instead puts effort into other arguably more important things like good overall characters, storytelling, etc. to just make a good movie outside of gender constructs. These new movies put all of that below pushing a political/social narrative and in doing so the plot and character development suffers and the end goal becomes transparent thus appealing to nobody."", ""At this moment, with messaging, they just can't do it right. I had high hope for She-Hulk, but it was just a disaster."", 'Which is why it\'s funny when centrists always say ""the best female character is a character who happens to be a woman"" that\'s just not true. Women aren\'t just reskinned men.', '\u200b@@MALICEM12 tl;dr What the centrists are saying is correct. You are destroying an either accidental or purposeful oversimplification of what the saying means.\n\nI mean, you\'re right and you\'re wrong. You are absolutely right in that women aren\'t just reskinned men. You are wrong when you imply that centrists saying ""the best female character is a character who happens to be a woman"" means that they\'re saying you can just slot any sex to a well written character. That\'s because you\'re purposefully leaving out the fact that a ""well written character"" takes into account not just the character\'s role and importance in the overall plot as you imply but all of their characteristics including believability and portrayal.\n\nI\'ll use an example: Percy Jackson & The Olympians. Could Rick Riordan have made Percy female and still had a perfectly good book? Not if he just changed the sex. Would Rick Riordan have to significantly change the plot to make a female Percy work? Maybe on a micro scale. He absolutely could have made a female Percy work in that exact same story role with the exact same overarching plot line, it would have just required effectively a different character and portrayal.']"

Through thr course of the film, you discover Cap Marvel basically wrecked a planet's ecosystem. She thought she was doing the right thing, but had unintended consequences.
That's a GREAT way to give her a challenge to overcome, since she is so powerful.
A humbling journey that can't be resolved by her powers. Awesome.

I really hope the Borderland movie is going to have good female characters	[]
Superhero movies and action movies were designed for the targeted audience which is mostly men as that's their main interest. Making them appeal to women, which most don't even watch them and that's a recipe for failure.	[]

Women don't even like those fucking movies anyway. You want women to show up at your movie, make shit like Black Swan. Beautiful, psychologically thrilling, mysterious.

"My suggestion is to do what I did. Let it all go. The Star Wars, Marvel, Lord of the Rings, etc. that we loved are never coming back. Even if they did it's too late.  Nothing other than total erasure of everything post-2014 would ever bring me back to Star Wars. That's never going to happen. 

So I moved on. That's how real life works. Holding on at this point is sheer, infantile folly."	[]
Nailed it.	[]
All my female friends and me love marvel / lord of the rings etc. It is appealing to all genders. The problem with Girlsbosses and MSHEU is not the female lead , its the fucking crap of a movie!!!

No one is forcing you.""

But when the new audiences fail and ignore these franchises. then what are these Social Justice Wankers doing? They blame the old target audience that they no longer do this for but are told ""This is not for you"".

Considering how much they've alienated their core audience I don't think the Marvel/Star Wars franchise's have a good future, they might make a few passable movies but I think the days of everything them making being a hit are long in the past and they'd need several years of doing the right thing to get that back.

It's a anti female mindset. We like women but only if they fit our female ideal.

"The most frustrating thing about all this is that the blueprint for ""strong female lead in a male-dominated setting/genre"" has EXISTED FOR DECADES. Ripley, Connor and Trinity have absolutely grinded themselves against massive odds and used determination, intelligence and aquired skills to overcome them.

I hope they all go out of business so actually creative people can make stuff again	[]
I know this is what we're talking about because its the speaking points everyone are using, but while I agree that using a male centric genre to push female idealisms was forever a bad move, I think the point that is constantly being missed is that the writing and directing for most of these movies is also terrible, and a big factor for why they are failing. Mind you, Critical Drinker does mention this specifically, but more as a product of what happens when you write characters that don't suit the target audience. Just like the failings for the Thor series, the writers and directors need to do a better job selling a more coherent story and quit it with the comedic punchlines when they don't call for it.	[]

"Yesterday Overlord DVD (Dictor Van Doomcock) released a video where his spies interviewed a high-profile actor whose identity wanted to remain a secret. The actor stated with confidence that there is a network of feminist ideologues who are at the highest levels of influence, run by an entity codenamed: The Broker. Apparently, this individual or group of individuals are intentionally trying to inject this feminazi bullshit much to the dismay of investors, audiences, and everyone in between. Now, I will be the first to admit that ""The Broker"" sounds a bit hyperbolic and, well... fabricated. But at the same time, I also 100% believe that there is an uncanny level of coordination between these different projects at different film studios, where it all lines up a little too perfectly for it to be a coincidence. And these feminist writers/directors/producers who all run under the same flag all seem to write themselves into the movie they're making. I don't believe in ""The Broker"" like this anonymous actor reported, but I do believe in the network they're all reporting under. Times may be a changin' and male-dominated stories can have male influence again, but be VERY wary: these feminazi Broker assholes don't have any intention of giving up whatever power they have and they will rear their ugly blue-haired heads again."

I slightly disagree. I think most men dont mind a strong female lead if it is a good story.

I like gangster, war and superhero movies and I'm a woman. It's all about a shitty script, when someone treats the main audience like an idiot, that's how it ends.  A well-written character is one in which you can rotate the gender and race and the character still maintains the level, e.g. the character Ripley could be played by a man with Chinese roots and still be an equally cool protagonist.	[]

"I think it's interesting that by trying to be more inclusive, Hollywood actually comes off as more mysoginistic.

"['They are not characters, they are caricatures: invincible Mary Sue super-beings. Thus they make them unrealistic, unlikable and unrelatable for anyone; more comical than heroic.

And their Success would never be measured in the total annihilation or fall of the US for example, but simply by destabilizing those Countries enough by polarizing the citizens and pitting them against each other to create dissent, chaos, lack of patriotism & mobilization of the unified population towards a goal, they would have been successful in destroying the Social Fabric of a Society and its Moral backbone (or the one of enough of its citizens) so that the influence it exerts on the International Stage, the Power it Projects, its own Credibility, all would weaken it, alienate it, and allow other Malicious Parties to Grow without Opposition.', ""Otherwise it would be even less of a boss.

storytelling shouldn't be so black and white - different genres may cater to different audiences but it's what you do with the story and how you want to tell it that sells it in the first place, whether the main leads female or male, and that can be applicable to more female centered roles or male centered roles. just make a character feel like a character and don't rob it of it's integrity is all we ask	[]

Once again, The Drinker says it all succinctly and with humor and style.	[]
Hollywood has come, economically speaking, to a place of having to deal with democracy.  Everyone gets a vote, and the votes of those who don't spend ridiculously high prices for theatre tickets have just as much influence as the ones who do.  You see, dear viewer, that populations of voters in this equation who don't buy tickets are much more important than the votes of those who do.  A non-vote is even worse than a no-vote.	[]
"This was my point that I wrote in comments here and under nerdrotic clip. Barbie wroked so well cause it is female-oriented material made by female for female. I believe someone created ""modern audience"" on some strategy-house slides, presented that to boards that believed that they will make more money and also make sort of ""woke-washing"". Which ensures that leftists will not target such companies and allow them to do what they want to do with employees.
I will point out one thing - If there is around 25% males on female productions (and otherwise) it doesn't mean you have a potential to grow that part of audience. It is important who drives a decision to go to cinema and watch that movie. For example - I am sometimes viewer of some romantic comedy - my wife's turn to choose a movie. Next time I will take her on Dune 2, which is not interesting choice for her :). But she has to go. But there is no chance that she will choose such movie on her own even if Paul Atrida will turn himself into girlboss. 
It is ok to make some good female characters in male oriented type of movies. We had those ""decorators"" type of characters in old Bond movies and it is not what we want. It is also more appealing for that females that join their boyfriends or husbands if such well-written meaningful character exists."	[]

While I know i'm in the minority of females who prefer sci-fi, comics and action films, none of the female-centric shows appealed to me in the slightest because I can't relate to a bunch of mary sues and i also don't hate men.

Seeing a bunch of flawless forever-single (or if they're lucky, lesbian) 'girlbosses' is just bad writing and boring when that is all you do. These women have no personality and the writers don't have a clue how to write a compelling character.	[]

Ridiculousness goes only so far.	[]
Let's get down to the bottom of this, shall we?  Women and Men are different.   Women, except for the confused lesbian or trans ones, don't want a female hero.  They want a man.  A real man.  Just like in real life.  They want and, actually NEED a real man.  In the interaction of men and women and children, there's no doubt who does the heavy lifting: women.  Women just need the space a real man provides in order to raise the next generation.  If you think I'm being sexist, well, then you can s**k it.	[]

Yeah, because there's nothing I want more in a superhero movie than to watch a bunch of girls running around as opposed to seeing a bunch of ripped men beating the crap out of each other. üòè	[]

As Bill Burr said: women are failing women, not us.	[]
In short what they have been doing up until now is put a chick in it and make her gay	[]
Another key part of this problem is that the woke fools of hollywood (that sounds like a film title) listened to gender ideology to the extent that they persuaded themselves that gender wasn't a thing anymore and that they could treat the audience like it was one big blob. After all, if you believe that a man can be a woman and that non binary is a thing, why would you bother to cater for sex based preferences?	[]
Good riddance to woke torture	[]
Hollywood cannot recognize a cote target audience based on gender because gender is supposed to be a construct that isn't real. And the billions of dollars lost is happening because people that should be in crazy houses, medicated, and ignored when playing the activist is instead unleashed and platformed.	[]

Just as I been saying. In the past two rant videos. Women care more about shopping, talking about guys, and looking attractive. If they go to see a movie it's a chick flick. Not a lot of action movies women are into. Some women like them. But vast majority are into dramas. Guys are the main majority for action films cause that is what guys like. Same applies for video games and Legos.	[]

Hollywood trying to force beloved chracters and failing, also thinking women only want women in their films, its still men in charge just setting up all women projects, and watching them fail and wondering why, like just stop trying to push a message or trying to find the right formula to get 100% of the audiance and make actual normal movies to be enjoyed	[]
What did you think of Babylon??  I loved it personally but I know most hated it.	[]
If I want to go see a certain superhero/comic book movie my wife will go with me‚Ä¶if I don‚Äôt want to see a different superhero/comic book movie my wife will not go see it alone or with her friends.

I think right move at this point would be stop making massproducted pg13 superhero movies. And focus doing some R rated or more mature superhero movies and shows like Punisher, Spawn and Blade. Smaller production bringing steady money. Then when marvel fatigue has blown over do some bigger movies New and fresh.	[]
Oh - I didn't like Barbie either!	[]

I'm a woman - and can't stomach or watch any of this 'shove the message down your throat' crap.  I grew up where it wasn't an issue. Ripley in Alien, the movie The Women (original), Sarah Conner. Same with people of different races - it was NEVER a thing - we just enjoyed the films! Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, Predator etc. We just enjoyed the movies. Loved them! No issue - no race or political agenda - just fun great films. Now this is all being pushed down our throats not interested in any of it. And I'm not alone - I know we are the majority!	[]

"I remember when people just called movies made for women ""chick flicks"" a stupid name, but isnt that just what they wanted to make? Movies that appeal to mainly women? I feel like they just showed that there was nothing wrong with the status quo. Movies made for men, movies made for women, movies made for kids, and movies made for families. We already had that back before the mid 2010s. After all their work, shit talk, and pandering theyre moving right back where they started. Just without the dumb ""chick flicks"" name."	[]
my girl refuses to watch itü§£ yes im being a bad npc on being so bored figured wed watch horrible movies, was about to buy maam web and she actively does her best to prevent me to do so, watched shitty comedy movie instead and think its still a way better call than mine, love my girl	[]
"Chasing an audience that doesn‚Äôt exist.  Sounds like Bud Light.  Marketing 1A - who is your target audience? I‚Äôm not even a marketing major and I know that.

Now that he‚Äôs married he goes with his friends, his WIFE, a woman has NO interest.  The exceptions for me would be the first Star Wars and Star Trek movies because they had good reviews, stories and production."	[]
Women don‚Äôt want to be a girl boss. If you wanted to court the female audience they should have put in a stronger male superhero, capable and not a cuttlefish beta.

a female Superhero Movie that appeals to women would still need a male superhero, probably best would be one antihero (aka bad boy) and he falls in love with a women that reforms (controls) him  to become the real hero, bet lots of women would show up for such a superhero movie	[]

I have an idea: romance movies for a male audience	[]
Let's be honest.  Why would women like Madam Web or the Marvels.  Women would have, as a rule, a problem relating.  Again, as a rule, women hate other women, they just do.  Seeing four women working together is just a foreign concept to a majority of women.  Look up Bill Burr's women failed the WNBA.  His point was that women would rather watch Housewives of wherever tear each other down than five women working to together.  Men, on the other hand,  work together extremely well.  Both of these conditions are probably a result of biology.  Men hunted and to be successful in a hunt you had better work together or everbody dies.  Women gathered, cooperation for the most part was unneeded and at time would not be beneficial.   Just because we have progressed from that lifestyle doesn't mean the evolution has caught up.	[]
They run into this problem because they make movies for loud minorities today. So you don‚Äôt have the literal numbers to even break even, let alone net a positive.	[]
I liked the stand alone movie Black Widow. It made sense. Action filled. No plot holes. And it was funny because it made fun of the whole super hero genre.	[]
I did see the Marvels in theaters but I won't be paying to go see Madam Web. Not because of the pandering to a female audience, but because the movie looks and sounds REALLY bad.	[]

And they treat the female movie-goer in the same way: What (most) women enjoy is bad, and they are wrong to enjoy it. They should like superhero movies, dammit. 
They portray themselves as feminists, but apart from looks there‚Äôs actually nothing about women they like. They‚Äôre chauvinistic misogynists."	[]

It may work with kids and Happy Meals, but not with adults with mature brains who better understand what they want and why they want it."	[]

I hate that this whole quarter assed attempt at female action heroes will result in fewer or no female action heroes and more stereotypically female characters in the fantasy action shows i enjoy, where I and other women have so long wanted more awesome female characters.

If those women would actually watch sports like men watch sports. Actually go to the sporting events. Actually buy the merchandise. Do the payperviews and buy tickets.
Then the women sporting teams would make more then the male sporting teams because there are more women to spend money then males to spend money.
But they don't do any of these things for their sport teams so why would they do it for movies aimed at them?"	[]

1:30 They say that Madame Web was made to appeal to women, but I completely disagree. Women aren't so vapid that all they need to want to watch a movie is to know there are girls in it. Madame Web looked like crap. That's why I didn't see it. And that's why a lot of women didn't see it too. Good movies get an audience. I love fantasy (LoTR) and I enjoyed Phase 1 and some of Phase 2 of Marvel. I like stories about interesting characters. The problem with these movies isn't that women are in it. It's that the characters are unlikeable and the writing is lazy.	[]
Disney seems like a simpy nice guy trying super hard to attract women by catering to what he thinks they want and then getting upset when they‚Äôre not attracted to him	[]
"The problem isn't that this stuff is being made for women when it should be made for men. The actual problem is (much like with making stuff for kids) everyone assumes that if you make it for women, you don't have to put any effort into it. Because they'll watch it anyway.
In other words, the problem is that it's just garbage.

As an example, look at My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. A great show made by a woman for little girls. But everything before it (and after) has been garbage, because as far as they're concerned, you don't have to put effort into media made for little girls, because they'll enjoy it anyway.
But Lauren Faust actually did put effort into it, and in the process attracted all audiences, young and old, men and women. Because as it turns out, good quality appeals to everyone.

Madame Web didn't fail because it appealed to women. It failed because it was garbage that hoped that merely appealing to women would be enough to carry it. And then failing to realize what even appeals to most women!"	[]

Apparently, women don't need men.	[]
I think the problem is more on the side of, as you said, they're writing characters that _nobody_ can identify with, than that you have to make movies for a certain gender. I think normal boys and gals generally like the same things as long as it's of quality writing. This may to some extent be attributed to the fact that girls are very often influenced by stuff their boyfriends like, more than the other way around (for some reason). So if you lose your male audience you inevitably also lose a significant part of your female audience.	"['No, as the data shows ""normal boys and girls"" don\'t like the same things.', 'I\'m not even sure about this ""relate to"" idea anyways... Is that what makes good storytelling? Is that why the fiction you prefer is most enjoyable to you?\n\nGrounded in truth - as in stories that speak to the realities of the human condition - is what\'s missing. They\'re just bad writers, frankly. It doesn\'t matter if the audience personally relates or even synpathizes with the characters on screen - it just needs to be smart and compelling. \n\nIt\'s the intersectional left libs who think media is about ""representation"" and that everybody\'s such a raging narcissist that they only enjoy seeing their own personal fantasies or reflections of how they view themselves played out on screen. \n\nI think it would be cool if these producers just accept that Hollywood is chalk full of trash writers who can\'t produce a good story to save their own lives, and they ought to just mine classic fiction for adaptations (there\'s so much out there that modern audiences have no clue about) - whether it\'s scifi/fantasy, historical drama, thrillers - and faithfully adapt those already-good stories until they figure out what makes good fiction again.', ""@@SquareNoggin there is something to representation and one's roots, but the left lean too heavily on that as an excuse""]"

The entire idea behind girlboss is false and in reality doesnt actually exist and heres why: women cant physically beat men, period. Sure a woman can be your manager or possibly a ceo, but she cant beat a man in a physical contest, a man under her leadership knows this, and therefore, no man will ever view her as a superior because no matter what, physical domination wins the day, every day...thats just reality on a basic level. Yes someone can be more intelligent and overcome strength with wits, but thats like any human, male or female, pushing back against a moving builder and expecting to win; it wont happen. The only option is to get out of the way in order to survive and find a new solution and in the case of man vs woman, its no different. Thats what these people are missing: real women know this and men have always known it. We dont feel subordinate to women and pushing this kind of agenda makes us role our eyes and find something else to do, meanwhile most women who arent on a power trip and wishing they had swingin' dicks, arent interested in roles of physical prowess. The elites in tinsel town have no grasp of reality and they expect us all to verify their delusions and its not happening.	[]

For a long time I thought the girl boss trend in action and superhero movies was just plain greed with the production companies wanting to make as much money off of women as they were making off of men. Now after watching them stick with the same exact recipe flop after flop after flop it doesn't look like they're interested in making money. It seems like they are dead set on catering to an extremely small (but vocal) part of the population which doesn't really work well when it comes to making huge budget movies.

The ways things have been going the past few years, I don‚Äôt think Marvel or DC will go bankrupt. But for films and tv shows? It‚Äôs pretty much over for them. DC still has some good animated content to keep up momentum. But it really feels like the super hero trend is dying now. Companies like Disney killed it. Audiences aren‚Äôt fatigued of superheroes, more so badly written stories. Superheroes being involved in the bad writing however, has turned people off from the genre now. Leaving a mad taste that won‚Äôt quite go away. But, it feels more like videogame movies, and foreign/indie films and shows are what people are seeking to substitute the mediocrity Hollywood‚Äôs been offering for years now. Things will only get worse for Disney, if studios like Sega and Nintendo, keep up the momentum of films from Mario, Sonic, and other titles. Disney doesn‚Äôt have nearly as many iconic IPs of they wanted to follow that new fad.	[]

"Until the lockdown, my best friend and I used to go to the cinema 2 or 3 times a month. We would see a wide variety of different genres but we especially loved superhero films. The reasons for that? Well, women like eye candy just as much as men do so all the gorgeous guys were a big attraction at the start. But we wouldn't have continued going to see each new installment if we hadn't enjoyed everything about the films themselves, not just the cast. We went to see the first Aquaman because of Jason Momoa but thought it was awful so didn't go to see the second one. We also enjoy a good action film, so loved Maverick. Saying that, we're big fans of Tom Cruise and never miss one of his films, especially the MI series. Initially, we went to see some 'girl boss' films but quickly decided we were wasting our money. I was so disappointed with Oceans 8 because normally I really like Sandra Bullock, but thought the film itself was dreadful. Now, if it's a cast full of women, that screams ""don't bother"" to us. We never bothered with Barbie (even Ryan Gosling couldn't tempt us) but we have friends who loved it and kept telling us to go see it, but we just didn't want to. In 2022 we went to the cinema twice and in 2023 we went 3 times. I often drive past my local Vue and wonder how long cinema chains can keep going when I'm sure that we are not the only people who used to spend a lot of money on nights out at the cinema but now . . . don't."

"I really don't think I am against female heroins or bosses, because I enjoyed watching Ripley in Aliens and Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 so much.  It's always about the story telling and character development.  The ""strong female characters"" in recent trend are more like entitled Karens and bossy bullies to me than heroins.  And the worst part is, why do they feel the need for ruining and destroying male heroes in order to build these ""strong female characters""?  They destroyed Luke Skywalker, Ben Solo, Incredible Hulk, Gerald in Witcher, and many more, by making them like morons and arses.  I can see that Kathleen Kennedy holds a huge grudge towards men, but why does the whole Hollywood suddenly feel like she is the path to follow?

The problem isn't female lead characters, they've been written extremely well, many times over, for decades. Ironically, they tend to be written by men. Yet still, women find those examples to still be inspiring. This is because those women are written to be part of a well written film. The current method is to come up with a flimsy concept and make sure it's led by women. That's not how it works, if you have a great story, it is a lot easier to write a great female lead.	[]

Men and woman are ... well, humans, individuals and tend to deviate from ther roles more and more until they magically seem to not have much of a stereotype. You see this on girl gamers enjoying classic 'male' stuff more than the pink products. 

But buisness marketing/survey goblins don't go for them but easy-accsess demographics, trapen in heavy role models, and by that miss the mark and pass on this bullshittery - prolonging it a bit, but ultimatily fail with all of the connected industrys.

"Among the mess in this era. Only three female characters that I think they‚Äôre so well-written and outstanding.
.
Mizu from Blue Eye Samurai, Evelyn from Everything Everywhere all at once and Kim Wexler from BCS.
.
All of this character has stories on their own and their reason to be ‚Äústrong‚Äù not just the plot.
.
Mizu is a skilled Samurai who seeks vengeance, yet she is not that perfect, her fiery hatred often brought her in near-death situation or absolutely dead if she is not getting rescued by her friends that she didn‚Äôt care.
.
Evelyn in every universe, no matter she is the chef, action star, hot-dog fingers person or a rock, she is the strong woman, who wants to control everything, including her own daughter, as the reason why her daughter becomes the antagonist.
.
Kim Wexler is a smart woman, she can even outsmart Lalo in order to save Saul, yet her wits are the main problem of her downfall with Saul
.
And what are those characters development for them, a skilled side character no matter make or female. While we‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúGirlboss‚Äù trending, don‚Äôt you just love how those characters grow??? Despite of the Woke Witcher, Guyladriel or She-Hulk that creating a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù character without any improvement further.
.
While Mizu is always goes on her suicidal pilgrimage, she still got Ringo and Taigen, saving her life so many times.
and while they think that she is drowning in vengeance and beyond reasoning, The swordmaker Eiji still got her back, making her realize the true purpose of the blade she wields once more.
.
While Evelyn is bold, her husband Wang is the opposite side, he always find the wayout with no violence and also put a faith in her, making Evelyn believe in herself.
.
Kim Wexler is smart, along with Saul‚Äôs slick talk, they‚Äôre both unstoppable, until she realizes the consequences of her actions.

"One of my favourite characters growing up was Evie from ""The Mummy"". I related to her a lot: our love of Egypt, reading, and being a little clumsy (lol). Evie was strong in her own ways and supported the other characters where they lacked. They were a team. And where she lacked, she asked for help.

I think something that people need to realize is that it's not the all female cast, crew and everything that make people hate the movie. It's just that the movie is utter garbage. Get yourself an all female cast, crew and writing team who actually cares about the story and how it fits in this amazing wide world and I guarantee the movie will be a banger.	[]
They simply need to look back at some of the best female characters - Emma Peel (The Avengers) with John Steed were essentially 005 and 006.  A James Bond duo back in the 1960s. The great Diana Rigg. She was tough smart witty and still feminine - sometimes she would save Steed and sometimes he would save her. They were equal.  How novel. 70s Doctor Who had the smart Sarah Jane and followed her with the knife-wielding Leela and then the Romana's. Sarah Connor, Ripley, Marion in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Others have mentioned Tarantino - man he is in LOVE with women. Not much more fun than watching Uma Thurman slicing her way through - everyone. Star Trek has had great female characters in every series and they were doing it decades ago. It all comes down to the writing. Brent Spiner has said many times - if it ain't on the page it ain't on the stage. Write a great character - have that character make sense and say the right things and it shouldn't matter - Doctor Who didn't fail because of a female doctor it failed because the writing was utterly atrocious!

Its logicall to try this if you want to expand your business. You already know that men are going to see superhero movies, so how do you pull the female audiance in.

I watched Echo and i loved it, thought Captain Marvel 2 was mweh and Sony's Madame Web is just horrible. Disney/Marvel, needs to get their act together and fix Marvel and Star wars. Nobody said we hate Rey as a character, no the character itself was written badly and you mishandled legacy characters. Just make a good movie!

"To be honest, the idea of a women in power and making choices. Works in well written stories. Prime example of this is Princess Leia. The old one not the new one. She is the leader of not only an entire planet, but the rebellion. Yet she can be a bit snarky, comedic and at times diplomatic. as she is a multi faceted character who plays multiple roles in the story. And thus been idolized so well within media and pop culture. 

Compare this to any other girl boss character, and you find them all either have this strange sense of entitlement. They lack any kind of foresight or creativity. They just get what they want form life for no reason other then ""Women"". Yet they always feel oppressed even when their holding the whip. Like ""woe is me, i have to whip you slaves.

"I actually loved the Avengers movies and would be so up for a female led super hero movie. The issue is every character in these movies have the same cookie cutter ""strong female lead"" sarcastic takes no shit personality. They are written so terribly and never have any kind of character arc. My favourite characters of all time (in movies and series) are women but the women in these movies are souless. They think this is feminism or something when really its actually offensive to think we will eat this bullshit up just because it's female led? We arent robots, we want to feel something!! Give us women with  passion and flaws who overcome obstacles and adversity!! And we don't just want copycat lesser versions of male superheroes! Create new ones? Like ffs. It can't be that hard?"	[]

"they can easily recover franchises by declaring all that woke crap. non-canon and either stop trying to do sequels and remakes,or actually listen to the fans.
Star Wars as TONS of ready made plots already,all they needed was to cast and shoot.why did they do that crap?
Terminator should do a PROPER movie (or better yet,a series) dealing with the future war.they could do a pilot movie about John Connor,how he rose through the ranks ultimately leading the human resistance,and the series could follow a bunch of grunts just trying to survive like Band of Brothers,but way more tech horror.
So many franchises could be easily fixed...
so many series get canceled or show promise and they don't fund them not because of money,but because of ideologies..."	[]
6:09 that's one thing I loved in Maverick. It had diversity, but it didn't say anything about it. When you saw those people, how they carried themselves and treated others- you didn't for one second think that they were diversity hire fighter pilots (if such a thing even exists). You saw them, though: another fighter pilot, or second seater person, and moved on with the plot. Excellent inclusion that didn't feel forced. I rooted for every character in that movie, because even if they were arrogant, and confrontational- it made sense. They were the best, and they knew it. They all wanted to survive the mission and they knew if they didn't get the best from their team they might not make it back.	[]

I find it funny the idea that men would be less inclined to watch a superhero movie with a female lead. Like if they made a super hero film that was good and the lead was female we'd all me like nah fuck that. I mean I probably wouldn't watch it because I have super hero fatigue at this point but let's say it was a war movie and the lead was female and the movie had a good script. Like I'm not making choices of movies based on the gender of the lead I'm choosing movies to watch based on whether they look good to me and whether they are getting a lot of praise from everyone. I've seen Alien so many times and always enjoy it because it's a good movie and no one cares that the lead is a woman.	[]

They actually work together to stop the Mummy. Just IMAGINE it, guys. They work as a TEAM. No such thing as men-bad, women- good. No. Everyone brings something to the picture and somehow it works out! And there is adventure and action, and romance. Just imagine this kind of movie made today.

It‚Äôs almost like modern writers have never seen Alien/Aliens, Silence of the Lambs, Contact, Arrival, Gravity or the many other great movies with strong female leads often with strong male secondary characters with conflict without having to resort to the heavy handed know-it-all superiority focus. Even older more lightweight fare like the detective/comedy shows like Remington Steele and Moonlighting show strong female leads working with goofy guys but it worked because they played off each other as a team and the writers exploited the ‚ÄúOdd Couple‚Äù inter play instead of one character bashing the other over the head all the time.

Facts	[]
"So interesting to see the figures! Also shows that my instinct is correct to find a male co-writer for my show, so we have both perspectives, especially as the main character is a man.

Personally, I'm a woman with a preference for fantasy, historical drama and superhero stuff. I also like action movies and sci-fi, but to a lesser degree. I do know a good deal of women who like fantasy and historical stuff and are also a bit into superheroes, but I've noticed that some of them do focus on the love relationships in these genres. Not necessarily my cup of tea to dwell too much on it unless I'm freshly infatuated (been a while), although I think it's important for character depth to show the relationship if they have one. But seems to confirm the figures here.

In any case, I've never had issues with male heroes, I think it's just outright wrong to assume that an audience can only relate to characters that are like them on a superficial level like gender, age or cultural background. It's the beauty of fiction to allow us to walk in someone else's shoes for a while and to safely dip into the experience of things we likely won't ever experience in our own lives and often don't even want to experience in our physical reality, yet it expands our lives and horizons. I do relate to characters who have some trait in common with me, preferably a character trait. But I usually become the biggest fan of characters who are very different from me, but touch me in some way on a deeper level (often an antagonist or villain with a vulnerable aspect). Then, there is a difference between relating to and sympathising with a character and admiring them. 

But for me, it doesn't really matter if relatable or admirable characters are men or women. The only difference is if I find them erotically attractive - which, by the way, is something often appreciated by women: looking at male bodies in action. ;)"	['Agreed with everything. \n\nAnd yes, men doing manly stuff and using their powerhouses they have for bodies make many women swoon ... or at least catch their interest. Fighting prowess and just competency in general are very attractive.']

Here's a thought, simply take a great story that already is a proven success or popular and then get the best people to make it. And when I say 'best' I mean good at their job.	[]
"Alien, Wonder Woman, Kill Bill, Underworld, Tomb Raider, Atomic Blonde, Salt,  Lucy,  The Hunger Games, Alita, Resident Evil, Prey,  Hanna, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Scream, Halloween, etc.. all made money and all with female leads.

So it's not like men hate  movies with female leads nor that men don't wanna see a strong woman in action/scifi/horror

It's that we are sick of: ""taking a beloved movie and gender/race swap it to push an agenda (mostly feminist agenda)."", instead of making a new interesting story with a really good female character. 


Look at Underworld: Selena was a strong, intelligent and badass warrior who saved and protected Michael. 
Look at Ghostbusters (2016): Every men is evil or stupid af, even slimer! Janine was never stupid in the original Ghost Buster.

maybe if superhero movies were actually targeted towards women they would watch superhero movies??? not talking about madame web; nothing about that movie is feminine in any way shape or form. it looks like every other generic super hero movie. i think there is a big gap in the market for feminine superhero movies, but no one is making them. women (unlike men) are actual visual creatures. we want to see nice color palettes, cute and comfortable outfits, a wide range of different characters with different personalities. and throw in a handsome dude actor somewhere in there. but no one is making these movies.

"Yeah, Disney is in trouble either way.

Star Wars has become unsalvageable. They would have to go the ""It was all a dream"" route and retcon all their movies and most of their other nonsense out of existence. Maybe even completely reboot the franchise to get some fans back, because after what they - and traitorous actors like Hamill - did, many can't even watch the old stuff any more.

And Marvel will probably never be as profitable as it was when they established the MCU. Superhero movies are dying out. Most people are sick of them, like someone eating nothing but their favorite snack for a whole month.

Even if they fix their approach, they won't be able to churn out movies and series like crazy and be profitable.

So at this point, they probably need to sell off their two big acquisitions - both of which they massively devalued - and just focus on their fairy tales (and by that I mean making good fairy-tale movies again)"	[]

I can understand why Barbie was a success. I can even understand it's appeal even though I'm a male but in all honesty it was a bad movie. It was over the top feminist propaganda.

Marvel & Co. could probably keep producing movies that some guys would watch forever, yet they wouldn't be any better AS movies (see Scorsese). Some guys/girls just want to see their avatars kicking ass on the screen in juvenile fashion while others are kept in worshipping/supporting roles and that's just the way it is whether anyone wants to create a business model to serve it or not. Gender politics IS being played out onscreen, but it's neither any indication of, nor any substitute for, quality... it's just merely an attempt to play to and cash in on bias.

Even if it's true that Marvel's (and others') experiment to win over female audiences is a failure, it doesn't prove anything about the quality or ""cohesiveness"" of their projects either way."	[]

I‚Äôm a female with traditionally ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô interests. I can‚Äôt stand the majority of romances and musicals. And I still have zero interest in watching any of these shitty superhero films. The idea a film is ‚Äòcatered‚Äô to me because it features a bunch of one dimensional and boring female characters is insulting; I find the idea I will automatically relate to them because they also happen to share my gender to be incredibly sexist. I‚Äôve never given a shit what gender the characters are, only that they‚Äôre interesting and written well. And honestly, I think the majority of people‚Äî men and women‚Äî feel the same. My favorite films are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, an infamous sausage fest‚Äî and guess what, nobody had a problem with Eowyn being a badass in that.

Seems to me, the way to appeal to a female audiences is put strong leading men in films. The aphorism women want to be with them and men want to be them still holds true.	[]
Don't women want to see men?	[]
"This video is nice and funny, and insightful, but the issue is way bigger than anyone could talk in a small video or a comment.
In a nutshell, it starts from a point: everyone is equal. And by equal, the same.
In movies, that means that a certain genre will appeal to both men and women (and others), young and old, white and non-white. And if you don't like a genre or product, the fault is your as an individual, due to your bigotry."	[]
Unfortunately, I think it's too late for a lot of franchises. The A-list characters are dead or have been dragged through the mud, and the fans have moved on. The best we can hope for is saving video game and anime adaptations from being butchered by Hollywood just as bad as superheroes as those are going to be Hollywood's next cash cows.	[]
"That's exactly what actual popular characters have in common: they're idealized, but not perfect. Looking hot doesn't mean you have no qualities beyond that, and being strong doesn't mean you can't be vulnerable. The views of the ever angry Social Media mobs are so focused on being ""accurate"", yet also unable to take any criticism, that they end up destroying power fantasies for both sides with their incredible lack of imagination and critical observation. 
Wonder Woman used to be an inspiring warrior, one to prove that women could be strong, too. But she still had her feminine side, sometimes seductive, sometimes romantic, sometimes empathetic, which further compliment her abilities and strong will. And as the last of her tribe, she carries a great responsibility to uphold the values of the Amazons. Eliminating those traits means eliminating what makes Wonder Woman, well, a woman. Which is exactly what's happening to her now."	[]
"I also dislike how they think a female lead and characters and even producer are what women want. Seems to be very obtuse and limiting on women infact.  James bond was cool but not because there were zero women to be seen meanwhile men to them only serve the purpose of the evil white cis villain male except when they need to hit a diversity quota and then maybe theyre not white. The normal non agenda filled relationships between the male and female characters are vital to so many movies and the fact there is romantic tension elevates the movies and gives a whole different dynamic and depth these female power movies severely lack. Its like they forgot the insane amount of romantic novels that exist that women enjoy that are solely focused on just that.

I'm not saying movies that cater to women have to be romances, But even a hardy Clint Eastwood movie about gunslingers and gangs has a romantic aspect to it. Its not just soulless action for the sake of action and plot moving and expanding the hot stinking multiverse."	[]
"You know whats hilarious it's the fact that even when their audience try to tell Hollywood what they should add in the Superheroes shows to get more people to watch their movies they will go out of their way to shame you the AUDIENCE and call you misogynistic just for suggesting that they should make a movie that caters more to men for a genre that's mean't for mostly young boys to invest time in.
Like it's not rocket science it's common sense"	[]
I loved the scene in Endgame where Wanda confronted Thanos. It felt so natural and justified.  Conversely the girl power scene is the worst scenes I've ever seen.  So contrived and forced.

"You're just describing modern feminism , in the entertainment industry. Same present, different gift box.

A thing has to first be alive to die	[]
The studios try very hard to establish powerful women (actually to force them upon us). Why, I don't understand. There has been a lot of powerful women roles in the past in almost every genre (even without sexualization) ... and nobody complained. The problem is... that know men are degraded to sissies to upgrade the womens status in their respective roles and underline their prowess.... again, totally unnecessary.  Best example is the aliens series. Sigourney Weaver plays the mother of all powerful women without ridiculing the involved male characters. And she rocks the role with her charisma and all-around presence which is, and that's the very important part, carried by an awesome story. So... stop searching for excuses why movies with leading female roles bomb at the office. The answer is easy: the stories lack originality, credibility, continuity and common sense and often disrespect the source material (Echo would have had such potential if they would have taken the slightest clues on the Daredevil-Series while staying true to the source material instead of changing everything about the character to fit in some agendas nobody asked for). AND: most the respective actresses have the same screen credibility as an empty coffee mug. So instead of blaming the audience for not understanding the message or the movie itself... think about what the audience expects. Stop trying to forcefeed us your bullshit. Stop wasting our time and money. Stop denying the inevitable truth that nobody cares what executives think is the right move when clearly it's not... and actually start using this underrated thing in your skull which you forgot to use for anything else than counting money: your brain.

"Look at arguably the most successful girl boss in movie history, Ripley from Aliens. 

She wasn't just some girl that was better in every way than the guys. She was physically weaker but used her smarts instead of going in all guns blazing like the others did. 
She got scared, hurt , lucky at times. And ran when she could. 
On top of that, once they introduced Newt as a character in aliens, she became maternal. An entirely female trait. And this was essentially most of the driving force of her overcoming her fear to tackle the Queen Alien. 
She was a bad ass. Not because she was great at everything. But because she wasn't but still somehow found ways to survive. 
Same for the last girl in the Evil dead reboot. 
She was a bit of a boss because she gor fked for the whole film but still managed to be a badass at the end. She wasn't just a bad ass because "" men are stupid and women are better."" 

I love a good girl boss character of how they are done properly. 
I'm not really a fan of the type of movies. But even in hunger games at least Katness isn't just good at everything and never gets beaten or hurt. 
She gets helped or rescued several times and nearly dies multiple times. This makes her at least likable and you want her to succeed. 

You look at all these recent "" girl boss "" characters and they never loose !!

"03:25 Been a fan of the Drinker and a subscriber since there were only ~300K subscribers here, but I gotta disagree with this.

Here's a more radical idea: **Just have a freaking story WORTH telling.** Don't even think about Gender or whatever the hell. Just go outside, have some adventures, and genuinely, authentically **have a story to tell.**

My wife and I were watching the Netflix Anthony Bourdain documentary a few days ago. Despite our different genders, we both loved his works because he was so damn authentic all the time, and he actually wanted to share stories from his various life experiences.

While Drinker is right here that people do some preferences at a macro level, I believe authenticity and thoughtful creation will outweigh any such considerations. Pixar used to be an outstanding example at this.

Also, I'm raising this point because, think about it, as a dude, how ""fun"" have even the gender-targeted content been for me, lately? Marvel (as all viewers of this channel now know) is a shitshow, even for the male-centric shows (ShangChi and all). Blue Beetle and Aquaman 2 caused me to write off DC.

It is important to say that it is not about being female-led. It is that, if you focus on only hiring women to lead the writing, you narrow your pool substantially, and men - for whatever reason you chose to focus on - are better at writing deep fantasy stories. Naturally, the probability of getting writers that are good at their job, and this job in particular, is lower compared to not hiring people for sexist reasons.	[]
"A common problem is all these activists in Hollywood who have no skin in the game, taking over these well-established franchises and running them into the ground, trying to force feed and torcher the audience with their ""watch this or you're a misogynist"" approach."	[]
"Agree. But check out the first three original ""Girl with the dragon tattoo"" films with Noomi Rapace in the lead role as Lisbeth Salander. They are very true to the books, and at times brutal but show how to write a believable, likeable female lead character."	[]
As the drinker said, men and women like different things, i for instance like setting shit on fire, chopping and hacking at stuff with knives and axes etc, my wife? Well she's not into that kind of stuff .	[]
I dont think i could ever stomach to go back and watch anything put out by the likes of Disney, even if they now start to do things differently, damage has been done, it would take years of therapy to dismantle my girl boss radar, have dumped every TV and movie platform i had, its a rare thing these days just to get a decent movie or tv show which is sad, looking forward to Dune 2 tho.

Madam Web could have been saved, somewhat at least, with a decent writing team, who had characters act like actual people. I‚Äôve not seen it, but apparently a bunch of teenage girls have just escaped someone who has been trying to kill them. Left in alone in a park (wtf?) they get hungry and go to a diner. Here they start flirting with some boys and dancing on the tables. These ladies either have the mental resilience of an SAS trooper, or they lie somewhere on the spectrum. Or are modern girls this frikken stupid? üòÇ	[]

"As a woman who loves many male-centered movies, both classic (like The Great Escape, Lawrence of Arabia, The Day of the Jackal, The Hunt For Red October etc.) and newer, I'd say that women hate nothing more, both in movies and in real life, than aggressive, abrasive, arrogant women.

I'd say that Ilsa Faust in the Mission Impossible franchise is one recent example of a female action hero done well. She is attractive, feminine and has feelings, but she is also mysterious and absolutely kickass. She doesn't do childish power games and doesn't denigrate the main hero. She is someone both women and men can relate to."	[]
Some men buy dildos so lets focus our marketing at making and design our products to get the customer base to 50/50	[]
based on the chart the opposites based on gender is musicals and war history. so a musical that had accurate military history would be adding masculine to the feminine, and adding musical sequences to a war movie. you see this in Bollywood and it does well. but the western world is allergic to accurate history, hence why movie numbers are flopping for men.

"From a business perspective, none of this makes sense.  To lose tens of millions, one production after the next is not sustainable.   But from a propaganda perspective, it makes perfect sense.  They're not losing money. They're spending money to buy the ""hearts and minds"" of a small percentage of what remains of  their audience. To make them sympathetic to ""the message"" in their every day lives."	[]

1988 Working Girl did a better job.  A very well made movie, entertaining and very inspiring. If you haven't seen it, it worth it. Great for college aged women who want a real career.

Dammit drinker! You killed it again! Absolutely spot on.	[]
Pretty much spot on. I've been saying this repeatedly for the past years. Marketing demographics exist for a reason. Watching detached from reality Hollywood retards trying to ignore them or re-invent them was a fun experience to watch, now let's go back to making fun movies.	[]

The purpose of these films is to drive male audiences toward conservative parties, while they use other channels to drive women into liberal parties.  The people driving the media are dividing the Working Class, so they can keep people from coming together in any meaningful political mass.	[]
"My god this is 100% on point. Im a woman and absolutely hate these stupid female characters. I want flawed, interesting, funny female characters that have interestibg (and believable) interations with male characters that doesnt revolve around how much ""stronger"" they are. In real life, women are not physically stronger than men. Women are not the same as men and don't wish to be.

 Life would be boring if we were all the same. Interesting how they aren't trying to make romance movies appeal to men as well. Why keep trying to force women to watch these superhero movies that women overwhelingly aren't interested in? I dont even know if there is some sinister ""message"" issue either. Just clueless execs that think throwing a female lead and female directer suddenly means we will just love it. Like women arent that simple? And most women like men as well included in media."	[]
Wow, the death of that imaginary thing	[]
"I think the problem isnt about having female leads, its about the passion behind the project and the reasons for making it. There are just as many male lead projects failing right now and the common factor is the shit writing and cynical cash-grabbieness.
If Marvel (or whoever) can find a story that they actually want to tell, the success will follow. The problem is they wrapped up thanos, retired most of the characters in short succession, then just flopped around in the general direction of Kang because they felt the need for some ultimate objective, while also throwing shit it every direction to see what stuck."

"Plenty of my friends are women and while we're interested in Some different things there is always more than enough intersection. Hell, most of them like even more sex and violence than I do. The critical thing for most women I know (even more then for most men) is that a story has to make sense and the characters have to be interesting and likable. Women tend to be way more wired into social dynamics and subtlety then men (on average). So throwing a crap story with crap characters and no character arc will piss them off, girl-boss or no. Look at the female reviewers for this, or for the live action Mulan or Velma or whatever. 

These movies aren't failing because they're 'catering to women'. They're failing for the same reason why 60s 'catering to women' stuff failed (hey, we'll put women in bikinis hugging some dude's knee-cap, women like that, right?). They're failing because they aren't Actually catering to 'modern audiences', or women, or whatever - they're just trying to milk those audiences for easy-cash by having 'strong female characters'. When the Actual 'modern audiences' want Actual well-rounded characters, with arks, with plots, with failings to overcome.. just like men do. Euphoria and Shameless were shows that were Loved by women. All the female characters were super-flawed and broken. Game of Thrones (S1-6) did super well with both men and women. Encanto. Hunger Games. Tomb Raider.

""Modern audiences"", and women (who are not ""modern"", I promise everyone women have existed just as long as men, at a more or less 50/50 ratio of the human species), like good movies. Bad movies flopping just indicates bad movies are bad, and pandering does not make up for quality. Because ""modern audiences"" have working brains that can process content quality."	[]
If they screw up blade....Im done...	[]
There‚Äôs another side effect of being saturated with all these girl boss and genius geek girls in modern films; they change how you look at older films, and not for the better. As an example, I watched some of ‚ÄòDoctor Who and the Daleks‚Äô just a few days ago. Doctor Who was just a silly old forgetful scientist, while his daughter and grandkid were both science geniuses, and Roy Castles character was a bungling idiot. I used to get a bit irritated by the portrayals, sure, but now I looked at it with a level of exasperation that I hadn‚Äôt felt before. It was no where near as bad as what we get now, but the well has been poisoned. The film has no modern messaging intended, but so much entertainment is now stuffed with it that you end up seeing it anyway. It‚Äôs infuriating.	['I think thats the point. They demoralize fans of franchises. To get them ready for the next phase of social engineering if not already.']
It literally took an episode of South Park for the studios to realise ‚Äúmaybe we shouldn‚Äôt alienate men‚Äù.	['South Park has come a long way from its roots of satire into full blown Oracle of the obvious.\nReally tells how the film industry went.']

"I don't know.  I feel there is a very real danger here i dont I think the message should be women can only be confined to the Barbie rom com relationship genres.  There are many women star wars fans who prefer the original trilogy over the pandering nonsense of Disney.  The main message cannot be we should create gender segregated generes and give up challenging stereotypes completely.  I think a more nuanced solution o
Is to make Smart nuanced 3 dimensional characters period who are genuinely likeable.  Women can be Strong and feminine in a way that doesn't have to either put down men or present them as perfect ""mary sues"". Madame web in her cringe movie says to The girls something like i see your futures and you grow up. X y or z just like i knew you could... There is zero character development for any of the girls and Madame web doesn't even like them for most of the movie.  Its a cringe message written shoehorned in at the end to pander to a female audience. Its a corporate mistep thinking this is what people want to hear.  Pandering is a poor substitute for actual depth and character development The solution is more creativity 3 dimensional characters not gender segregation. Women don't have to hate or dismiss men as irrelevant which is a trend in Hollywood now.  The issue ISN'T women can't or should not be in action movies the issue is the kinds of women who are being created are turn offs for everyone.   Aoywynn was a fine character in lord of the Rings. She was 3 dimensional had emotional depth and she did fight as well seemed real felt grief. Leia was a 'strong female character"" but completely believable shes both rescued in the first movie and rescues han in the last movie.  Again no one disliked her.  Padme too strong character intelligent a senator and also fought when she had to in episode ii. What do both padme and Leia have in common they both love and care about the men in their lives.  They experience pain have emotional stakes fear conflicts.  The message of the Barbie movie is women SHOULD not be like thpse characters anymore because that is weakness and supports an imaginary patriarchy.  Princess in disney movies NOW need no prince.  Love is weakness being rescued is weakness.  Being strong means being confident narcissist and little else. Women should NOT be emotional or care about men it gets in the way of their alleged self actualization.  That may be popular in a movie like Barbie design to pander to THAT audience.  I hope that THAT Audience doesn't represent all women though.  If it does society itself has larger problems. I hope the greater message is great female characters can be both emotional and have good leadership  characteristics. One does not have to be sacrificed for the other"	[]

"I think this whole gender neutral fad malarkey may've played into their decisions, this idea that girls and boys like the things they like because of the culture they grow up in, and nothing to do with the physical differences between the sexes. Or maybe not, acid may've been on offer in Hollywood at the time üòÇ

Either way, I'm done with big studio films, if I hear of something different and good I'll try it. There are so many great films of the past, and good games (mainly out of Japan) to play. Hopefully Hollywood lost enough of it's audience / money to never do this again, but never say never (again...üò¨)."	[]
The real question is; will these fanbases consistent of mostly (white) men return once these companies start pandering to them again? After a decade of being called sexist, racist and basically the root of all problem in society, how long will it take for that fanbase to forgive the corporate overlords? How much pandering will there be and will they buy it? Because you know once the company starts losing money, all their super important messaging will suddenly become less important. They might even support the counter-narrative just to get you back.	[]

Girl bosses are not a bad trope per se, when they are working alongside men, rather than spending 90 minutes kicking them in the nuts (metaphorically and literally).	"['Exactly, Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 is iconic in bad assery\nSame with Ripley in the Alien films', 'Sarah Connor is not a ""girl boss"" she is a competent and driven person with clear goals. She arose from the ashes of a quivering blob beating her foe with luck and grit and help. In t2 we see that character AFTER years of single-minded training. It\'s the heros journey, girl boss is mary sue different term same meaning.', ""You don't know what a girl boss is then"", '‚ÄúGirl boss‚Äù kind of took on its own definition in the film community. A ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù working alongside men would be contradictory, because the entire point of the trope is to belittle and overshadow men.']"

"There's just a fact they have to deal with: Men like the violence, women don't. Men are obsessed with conflict and fighting and enjoy the thrill of battle, most women don't. At best you have some that views fighting as an unfortunate necessity. Yes, some women do enjoy what men do, keyword: SOME! Just like how Romance genre movies are primarily viewed by women, but some men do enjoy them as well. Again keyword: SOME men do. It's not impossible to mix and blend these things together to appeal to a wider audience but you still have to take into account what each side enjoys more on a general side. Put most of the male cast in the action scenes and the female cast in the emotional scenes so each side can relate to the interests that appeals to them. It's why people STILL LOVE the dashing knight/prince saving the beautiful princess trope. This is human nature, not assigned roles, despite how much they love to shove that bullshit down everyone's throats.

And the thing is it's even impossible to do entirely led female led action projects. Literally the entire Magical Girl genre is built on it, but you know what they do different? They add more emotional themes and arcs into them, making less action oriented and that works just fine because you have women acting like women. Winx Club, W.I.T.C.H, Sailor Moon, all perfect examples that balance interpersonal relationships and drama with exciting action scenes. And unsurprisingly those shows have a dedicated female audience, either to the point they are the main demographic or equal with the male audience. These people just need to accept that men and women are completely wired differently amongst the mass majority across the entire world and no matter which side of the planet you go to, it'll be the same. There are exceptions, but they're not the example that discredits the common held beliefs. And they're not going to change just because you don't like it and want to try and force your world view in everyone's faces showing how it ""should"" be. And the world is better for that, imagine how boring it'd be if men and women had the same tastes and preferences. Color would drain out of existence if that were the case until the dull grayness matched such an idea."	[]
Hopefully it's over. Remember La Femme Nikita (French action film). I loved that film. The female lead was a complex female character, complete with many flaws which made her likable and believable. When she killed someone, it wasn't just shrugged off. It spawned a heap of similar movies and if studios were smart they would let it still influence them today.	[]
What an absolute banger of a video. Legitimately don't think I've seen such a great take on the current state of the movie industry	"[""He's just getting warmed up mate""]"
In a nutshell, men and women are different and have different likes/interests, and forcing one or the other to like mediums they're respectively not interested in will not win any studio favors. Not to mention being too diversity actually gets people further and further away from each other, because diversity is prioritized over telling a good story, same with all the stupid checklists and appealing to weirdos and crazy people who probably won't watch the movie anyway.

The ancient one didn't need to behave like she hulk to prove that she is powerful. Black widow was way better than this characters will ever be.

One thing u failed to say and see is that barbie actually won the male audiance with KEN.

So yea, sorry ladies, but even your movie of the year says a world done by men, is a better one.	[]
"""I don't know if women are enough to carry the box office""
Here is your problem, chief. Not only is the audience 70% male, but the 30% female population likes pretty much the same as the male audience, making gender completely irrelevant.
These guys forgot they were supposed to make movies and not just check fanservice boxes for a fanbase that never existed.
At this point Hollywood seems like a fast food vendor, who makes their burger with this crappy cheese that due to high fat and additive content tastes ""good"" (you know the taste), so they decide to make a burger that's just literally a giant block of cheese between two buns, effectively inedible and the only ones ordering it are the ones who would eat literally everything except a healthy meal."

As Hollywood has become more Matriarchal and women have taken over executive roles, writer roles, director roles, producer roles, Studio Heads etc. it's become crystal clear that on mass women are incompetent in all aspects of the creative process. Now don't twist what I'm saying, sure some women can handle those roles and excel. But they are the exception and not the rule. Why because of the difference between Men and Women. The difference in genders leads to a clear and obvious distinction in roles in the work force that they excel at. It's not complicated but it is distasteful to the Utopia Marxists who control these institutions.	[]

"There's a manga series from 2009 called ""Bakuman"" that addressed the pandering issue before it even became an issue. The lead characters are a pair of guys who work as an artist/writer duo, producing comics for ""Shonen Jump"", Japan's top-selling manga magazine. For context, Japan has dozens of manga magazines aimed at a wide array of different demographics, and Shonen Jump is primarily targeted at teenage boys.

When the duo's first manga series starts struggling with low ratings, they make a rookie mistake and try to write their next arc to appeal more to female fans, focusing too much on their protagonist's romantic life and daily experiences. Their editor shoots the idea down bluntly as soon as he sees the storyboards with these words: ""Shonen Jump has a lot of female fans, and that's great. Your manga has more female readers than average for a Shonen Jump series, and that's fine. But you have to remember that you're being published in a magazine aimed specifically at boys. Any girls who do choose to read our magazine are girls who specifically like boys' manga anyway.""

"My issue with these female led movies is the writing, the message, and the fact that they have to put men down all the time, its insufferable. I watched all the animated shows when I was a kid and I originally got into Marvel and DC stuff because of my brothers, and the stuff I stuck with either had a great story or I really liked some of the characters. I don't want an all female everything movie, tv show, or anything. They made this mistake with Star Wars and Doctor Who too, they think I wanted to be the Doctor so they changed him into a woman, and they didn't seem to realize that me, and other women like me, wanted to be the companion traveling with the Doctor, so when they changed it and started spouting ""the message"" I stopped watching. Same with Marvel and superhero movies, once you take away all the strong, heroic men and have just the women bitching and lording their power over people, I'm out. I don't want to see any more arrogant girlbosses, cuz I can't relate to those shallow harpies at all, plus I like men and they seem to hate them with a passion."	[]

"I think the reason why girl boss characters don't sell is because creators don't allow them to hit rock bottom.
Everyone can relate to the experience of hitting rock bottom, and everyone wants to rise from the bottom to top.
And the catharsis that comes from that is greater the lower the character falls.
That's why I love Spider-Man the most. 
But a girl boss character is not allowed to have that kind of hardship or crisis, so it's harder to get the audience to empathize or feel that catharsis.
Like in She-Hulk, the hardest moments in the protagonist's life are being catcalled and conflict at work, and overcoming these problems doesn't provide enough catharsis for the audience."	"[""Yeah, i do not mind a female lead. I mind the overpowering, near perfect characters who's only ''flaw'' is others not seeing how great she is. That not everyone is gasping about her talents.

"[""You didn't just compare 'The Beekeeper' to those other great action flicks.  The Beekeeper was your typical lazily written girl boss movie, except they fucked up and put a man in there.  Action scenes were horrible, I couldn't help but roll my eyes when Statham would rush a group of guys who are wielding assault rifles and smack them around then toss them off the stairs.  0 character development, but they tell us the guy is just such a bad ass that he doesn't even need guns against assault rifles he dispatches them so easily. That's your typical girl boss movie script.  Horrible, lazy writing with boring action.  I mean, in John Wick, at least they sell us the whole bullet proof suit story as a means for us to suspend disbelief when they survive bullet hits in that movie.  In The Beekeeper, zombies with ARs don't even bother shooting they just stand around with their guns pointed at him waiting to get smacked."", ""@@Fpsnut WRONG. There's no such thing as a man boss movie because action heroes are meant to be men. It's simply called an action hero movie. The action scenes were brilliantly choreographed. Newsflash if someone gets within arms reach of you and manages to redirect or seize your weapon, your gun is not going to be much use, in fact you can even be worse off as you're trying to regain control of your rifle and having both hands engaged are open to strikes.\nJohn Wick would've died from the various bodily traumas he endured, there were also various henchmen with weapons who didn't shoot John when they could've and waited to get smacked and thrown by Keanu. Also the element of surprise is definitely a factor, most of those swat guys were probably confiddent due to their guns and numbers, they couldn't conceive of an unarmed guy engaging them.\nIt's simply not a girl boss script because with Statham it's believable. with a 110lb girl it's not."", ""\u200b@@aaronbarlow4376üòÇ dumbest sh*t I've read so far.""]"

"There was an old set of unwritten rules in 50s and 60s Hollywood used by producers that went more or less like this:
1. A child will watch anything an older boy would watch. An older boy won't watch anything a child would watch. 
2. A girl will watch anything a boy would watch. A boy won't watch anything a girl would watch.
 That was how we came to have a plethora of sci-fi, fantasy and horror movies full of fanservice that brought in decent returns against laughably low budget.

Of course, 2020s are not the 60s and some adjustments would have to be made, yet considering how the new DEI formulas seem to only collect high budget flops, maybe - just maybe - Hollywood should change their strategy. Also, stop insulting their main paying audiece is rumoured it could help."	[]

Too much cucking at the end. Women are an accessory 90% of the time. Anything else is pandering to the mutants like they have been doing the whole time. The well done females in the 80s were the exception and used sparingly because you have to tread lightly on the when attempting it because people's bullshit meter is easily triggered by this stuff. Normal people ultimately don't want to see these counter biological lies. Only the mutants want to pretend obese women can do flips and and beat up men. The classic tropes are tropes specifically because they are rooted in real biology that has consequences. Even fantasy need to be rooted in these themes if it is to be successful. There has never been a movie or story that bucked these norms that ever became a mega classic like Star Wars and won over a culture, because bullshit only appeals to freaks who want everything to burn.

Basically, it all comes down to shit writing. You have talked about Long Kiss Goodnight on the channel. It had a female lead, and she was more capable than her male sidekick, but it was justifiable. She is an elite assassin trained by the CIA, and he is just a washed up private detective. But even so, he still pulled his weight and performed to the best of his abilities, and he compensated for his lack of skill with bravery and determination. That is how you write an action female lead alongside a male co-star.	[]

"One thing I did like in Top Gun Maverick, was that there was a female pilot in the group, but the movie never went down the path that so many movies lately would have gone because she existed in the movie. She was treated as a real character, I remember one other character taking a dig at her, but she shut him down and was just part of the team, and her gender never played a part in anything plot wise. She was just another top gun pilot, there because she was the best of the best, at the school to learn and prove herself (like everyone else who was there).

I remember mentioning this to my wife after the movie finished, because it was so weird lately to have a movie which just treated all the characters as actual characters, not just standins for whatever message they were trying to tell. I think the biggest failing the studios are making in trying to bring in more female viewers is that they fail to make characters at all that require more than a sentence to explain all their character traits. Just write good characters, tell a compelling story and you will eventually bring in new fans. Or in my wifes case, have hot guys named Chris play interesting characters and she'll come along to the movie to check it out."	"['Well saidüçª', ""yes, wow... imagine having personality driven characters instead of characters being solely a representation of it's gender."", 'I feel called out with the last sentence.', ""I didn't even consider her gender.

Sure they made her front and center in a number of scenes but the woke mind-virus was never injected into this film... and thank God for that."", 'Imagine being judged on your abilities üòÆ']"

I don‚Äôt mean to be a contrarian to Drinker, because I usually dig his point of view, but I don‚Äôt see any evidence that the gender swapping trend is over, and don‚Äôt think he proved his point other than a few facts about obscure cancelled shows.

You see they believe that they're doing their part in ushering in the utopia through ""progress"" (defined however they want, of course) and if they just keep hitting us over the head with the propagandized messages we will eventually change our bigoted ways and see the light. So, in other words, they've seen this doesn't work financially. They see it more than any of us ever could but the goal isn't to make money strictly anymore. They believe themselves to be the new prophets of the woke religion and they must help us dumb plebs see the wrongs of our ways and repent of our ""isms"" and to join in the fight. They believe in most splendid arrogance that they are messengers and this IS the message and they will keep going until they can't keep going."	[]
I think it will be really hard to change course at this time. A lot of these franchises are ruined forever unless you have execs who have the balls to just come out and say that all the movies of the past years are non canon and are to be discarded/forgotten. But i dont see them doing that. You cant continue with marvel or starwars as nothing has changed/happened. Storylines that were created in decades of films/series are utterly ruined now. A complete reset is needed if they want to get the audience back on board.	[]

"The female audience that wants an action sci-fi/fantasy story with a badass female protagonist who don't need no man is a myth, and Hollywood just refuses to accept that! It's like you said, they act like it's some flaw in the human race that needs to be fixed, how dare girls want girls who are feminine and want romance, and want guys who are masculine and can fight the good fight. Oh sure there might be women who are interested in the Strong Female Character story as Hollywood tells it, but it really isn't the majority like they want us to think. Take the reading community for example. There are quite a lot of fantasy book series with ""badass"" female leads that are insanely popular among female readers, but nearly EVERY SINGLE ONE has some kind of romance that is the main draw, meaning that there is ALSO a male lead to complement the female protagonist. Even speaking as a woman who really doesn't care for romantasy stories and just wants a good adventure whether the main character is a boy or a girl, I'm not at all attracted to the whole ""female protagonist with male traits"" thing. It just doesn't sit with me. If I wanted a character with male tendencies, then I want that character to be male. A female character can be strong without saying no to romance or being physically stronger than the guys, and if she is those things, it at least has to feel believable."	[]

"One piece of media that I thinks effectively balances male and female characters that are both badass and are human is ""Chuck""(2007-2012). All three main characters have great strengths that make them heroic but also are the source of their flaws, similar to Hercules and his strength. Chuck (Zach Levi) is a computer geek who is charming, intelligent, and brave  who loves his family and friends. However, his emotions can lead him to be childish, mopey, and meek, putting people and the missionat hand in danger. Much of his character devlopement is him becoming a hero dedicated to serving a higher purpose in life. Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski) is a baddass beautiful spy. She is deadly and smart, able to pick locks, pilot a plane, and a defuse bomb. She even took on Michael Clark Duncan in a fight winning through use of agility and deception rather than strenght. However, her profession has turned her into a cold and ruthless killer- a tool used by the government who is left isolated in the world by being forced to erect emotional barriers to survive. Much of her development is dedicated to her dream to live a normal married life with real friends and family. Finally, Casey (Adam Baldwin) is the standard, tatically brilliant, quippy NSA agent/ Marine who loves guns and Ronald Reagan. Basically he is an 80s action star. However, like Sarah he has no meaninful relationships and as the show develops he establishes genuine connections with people, without losing his killer edge. In short, ""Chuck"" was able to present a nuanced point of view demonstrating that being a badass is cool but comes with a price of a normal life. This allowed the audience to root for, symotahize with, and at times disagree with the characters without despising them. Even two veteran badass actors, Linda Hamliton (Sarah Conner) and Timothy Dalton (James Bond) have recurring roles in the show. Furthermore, ""Chuck"" effectively blends romance, comedy, action, sci-fi, and drama in one entertaining show. All characters, regardless of gender, have their strenghts and weaknesses allowing both men and women watching something to love. I think ""Chuck"" can be a blueprint for future shows to replicate."

Male writers are best for nearly any genre. I felt this decades ago. I could tell without even knowing the writer if it was written by a man or woman. This even goes for novels.

"No, it's not the end of the girlboss and wokeness... they know exactly why they aren't making any money on these movies, and they don't care.

You constantly seem to skip over the possibility that the ""illogical"" behaviour of the studios might have some logic, but not one that's immediately obvious to us outside of the top levels of the industry.

The logic is - we live in a post-profit world of business where huge corporations don't mind losing billions of dollars - because they're using this money and their products to shape future generations of consumers.

The studios themselves are rich beyond belief, and their investors have not billions but tens of trillions of dollars to use to create the way people will see the world.

They aren't accidentally destroying legacy characters in all the franchises at the same time. Those characters shaped how generations of men and women saw good and evil and what they aspired to become.

Yes, these new movies iritate a lot of us older dudes, but they are not made for us to see, they aren't made to generate profit, they are made to completely sever the link between the generations. 

Soon, there won't be movies in the classical sense. Everything produced by big business will be AI generated, heavily curated theme rides of escapist fantasy with no meaning or lesson. 

This era is just the transition period during which cinema and other arts will die, storytelling will die and it will be replaced by total corporate control over human desire for adventure, imagination, creativity.

Yes, corporate control. 

Not neo-marxist or woke or whatever. Those quasi-communists and neo-marxists are just corporate shills paid to add a veneer of empathy and equality to a future that will be completely run by IT giants, rich people and power-hungry politicians."	[]

"The solution is simple enough.  Just start catering to what the audiences actually want/expect from movies.  i.e. a good story that allows character development and satisfying conclusion.  Trying to regurgitate the same tired, old tropes revolving around the idea of, 'girl power', placing females into male roles, whilst simultaneously taking every opportunity to belittle and denigrate any and all male characters within, purely because they're male, whilst elevating all the female characters to being perfect, with the only flaw being males in their way, that need to be dealt with, isn't what audiences want to see, especially in practically every movie released within certain genres.  It's been done to death and no-one's interested in it, and never really was.

As a one-off, 'subverting expectations', movie, it might have been deemed passable.  But when it's the same thing done over and over and over again, despite the ratings for such movies not doing at all well, then you know it's more about, 'the message', than what the movies are supposedly about.  People have become ultra-sensitive to this now, and even the slightest whiff of, 'girl power', is enough to put people off.  Having scenes within established franchises that are eye-rolling cringy, is bad enough, but when they start making multiple entire movies that seeming do nothing but push, 'the message', then what do they really expect to happen?

Do they think everyone is going to suddenly have an epiphany, and realise how wrong they've been not to embrace the whole, 'girl power', thing?  Or, are they more likely to take one look at whatever image they use to promote the movie, with cinema-goers responding with a definitive, 'nope', to the idea of even entertaining the notion of going to see it, at all?  We all know the answer to that one."	[]

TNG has great examples of women being women while still taking charge. Troi was a teenager boy chasing for many episodes (which fit her character) but then ACTUALLY had to sacrifice to pass the bridge officer test. one of my favorite episodes. Tasha had a great arc even after being killed off. These females characters fit the story and even though it was sci-fi, they were believable. Strong men prefer strong women, not insufferable ones.

"""The writers and creators treated it as a competition that only one side (women) were ever allowed to win"".

And that, right there, is the reason why so many of the newer movies and TV shows fail. Take the Wheel of Time series by Rafe Judkins, for instance.

Instead of accepting the fact that the 3 main characters in the WOT series are Rand, Mat and Perrin, the ""creators"" turned them into ""damsels in distress"", throwing the entire WOT canon over the side and concentrating on Egwene and the other female characters.

There is few source material so complete and feature-rich as WOT, and it was mind-boggling to see Judkins and his team's shockingly stupid take."	[]

"If you turn your eyes to Japan, an ongoing (at the moment) 1st season of an anime call ""Frieren: Beyond Journey's End"" showcases an honest girlboss. The story starts at the end of a hero party's adventure. Throughout this adventure, the main character, Frieren, is a socially unavailable, long-lived elf character who is powerful beyond belief. However, the thing that hooked me to the anime was that Frieren regrets her social unavailability. She learns to become a teacher and an inspiration to others. She trusts the skill of her comrades and doesn't belittle anyone she's with. 
Imagine the snow troll scene in Rings of Power, but instead of Galadriel soloing the troll, she leads a tight formation with her soldiers to take down the troll. That's what Frieren feels like.
The author of the manga, Kanehito Yamada, is also a woman, but not like that adds anything, because it is more clear that Kanehito Yamada is a great writer."	[]

Ironically, in their attempts to empower women with flawless paragons of bad assery and terrible personalities.  They have created a world where their more enjoyed, relatable, and charismatic characters are men.

They forgot that when they were writing girl bosses that they self inserted into their shitty fan fictions.	[]
"I think the collapse of Hollywood still needs to happen for any real changes to be implemented. Hollywood was primarily driven by artists but reigned in by profit-driven executives. 
But what happened was Hollywood was put on corporate auto-pilot and the people supposed to be making course corrections were asleep at the helm. Which allowed the Kathleen Kennedy's, Kevin Feige, or that garbage staff in She-Hulk and ROP to become entrenched into the process. 
It'll take some really sheisty people to root those kind of people out."	[]
"Wouldn't it be more lucrative to just push out romantic chick flicks instead of action comic movies if the target audience is women?

Disney and Marvel should have just pivoted to romance movies instead of forcing tropes women don't want. Seems like, even catering to women, is not the priority. Which makes no sense."	[]
"Women have their own sorts of competition, a lot of them support the IDEA of ""the girl boss"" on paper, but in school and the workplace they often fight for power against each other, they try to one up and belittle each other which often leads to hostile workplaces and as a result a majority of women...don't like working for female bosses...so the real world ""girl boss"" is something they dislike. Think of it this way, Karen's love the idea of the ""girl boss"" but no one wants to work for a Karen. 

Then, while video games, comics, TV shows, movies and advertisements try to be ""inclusive"" and hit their characters with every branch of the ugly tree and alter their costumes to avoid ""the male gaze""...women don't like this either, they LIKE being and feeling pretty and if you've ever been to a convention they'll often find excuses to make costumes sexy like the ""sexy stormtrooper"". THEY LIKE hot women in hot outfits just as much as men do and they will flood into the theaters for an attractive man which is why the saying ""sex sells"" is true for both men and women...However., other women who struggle in the weight and attractive area get jealous and there's where the problem arrives. Because they don't compare then it makes it unfair and so all the rules must change and thus begins ""representation"" and the war against women....by women. They are their own greatest enemy.."	[]
If only studio exec.  and those god forsaken woke directors, producer and writers understand just sticking to the source materials will solve all their problems and the studio company wouldn't need  to waste millions of money on avertising. A good film loved by fans will automatically create traffic of ads on social media. A good example of sticking to the source material or the original concept is the Elden Ring  game when it released many western game company studio and critics hated MIyazaki and his Fromsoftware studio. They can't accept the fact that Elden Ring sold millions with no hidden micro transaction such as loot box and more, they cant accept the fact that Miyazaki stayed true to the concept of the game instead of copying what western company like Ubisoft, Blizzard and others are doing and still sold millions. If  they want a girl boss protagonist just cast Gina Carano the way she looks its still believable that she can take down men villians Gal Gadot is beautiful thats a fact but the amazons extras in the Wonder Woman films looks more  Wonder Woman than her.

I don't think females like females. They like if they can look down on a female character but females don't like a character that is better than them in every way. Men are a little different, we can look to someone like Arnold as example, and accept what he is, an icon of the 80's action scene, without jealousy. Women don't seem to operate that way.	[]

The reason this keeps happening is because the left wing ideologues firmly believe that you can transform and shift society into certain preferences.

"The thing I always take away from a critical and thorough/thoughtful analysis is not so much the issue of where the problems themselves come from it's can we get rid of sorce of them now. We've got companies full to the brim with activists and with very little actual creative skill as demonstrated by pretty much any script these days. Like a tick or a tapeworm or some kind of parasite they've buried themselves deep into the system removing anyone who would contradict them or not allow them to push their agendas and politics freely. We've heard the Bob Igger's saying that even though they weren't going to try to push politics anymore behind the scenes they actually will continue to do so even more than they did. I am truly concerned that we can get back on any kind of track without a massive purge and a complete reorganization of Hollywood and the industry. The problem is I just don't see that happening these people are too deep in the system and they've done too much damage already. I don't even think they care about what they're doing as far as making a product it's almost like most of what they care about is just tearing everything down and destroying the past. It is going to take an awful lot to tell me that we're anywhere close to back on track like we were nearly 5 years ago. I just don't know if they've got it in them to do what's necessary to allow a new renaissance to happen.

One minor disagreement I have with this video is that the real problem actually isn't that men don't like to see female leads in their movies, but rather that the female leads are really just men disguised as women. If a character walks like a man, talks like a man, thinks like a man, and in every other way behaves like a man, that man is going to have a hard time convincing his audience that he's actually a chick. Want to know how to make a female character who appeals to male audiences? Simple. Make her a female. Men like woman. A girl boss might as well be a chick with a dick.	[]

Pure conjecture, but could this all possibly have been because people aren't entering long-term relationships as much as they once did? I mean to say, husbands would drag their wives to action flicks, and wives would drag their husbands to romance movies. Now, women will still find men to drag to the romance movies, no matter what, but men who're not dragging women to the action movies... that's a loss for studios. If they can make super hero movies/show that are FOR women successful, then, problem solved! Probably nothing but a late night drunken thought that crept into my brain that I vomited into a youtube video.	[]

"I always think back to the classic action flicks of my childhood, particularly big Arnie and Stallones films. The male lead maybe a tough badarse but they're usually accompanied by a female lead. And even though they're not muscled up they're always shown be competent and can hold their own a different way. The perfect example is John Matrix from Commando. As invincible he seems on the battle field he's also reckless and got caught a few times. The woman he got to help him not only saved his arse but helped him get to his daughter in time. She was just as much integral to the story as he was.
The only exemption from this was Steven Segal, which coincidentally seems to be who girl bosses are modelled after.

The idea of taking this formula and reversing the genders but making the co star useless and incompetent is purely a spiteful feminist one."	"['Loved Rae Dawn Chong in Commando.

It's just struck me as you said that that there have been movies that I've gone to that I thought I was going to hate that my SO brought me to but ended up loving.  So having movies with better writing is a plus because we don't want movies that are trying to pander to everyone like you said."	[]

"If you're a girl who didn't like superhero films-them throwing more females in the movies wasn't going to make those women change their minds. 
The women who did like superhero movies, liked them the way they were. So all they did was alienate pretty much all the fans of these franchises, male and female."	[]

Iron Man through Engame was made for the boys. Everything else was made for everyone else. It‚Äôs really that simple.	[]
The thing that baffles me is that back when the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies were new, I heard plenty of girls say they liked Tobey McGuire.  There was no problem that needed to be fixed, they have lost the women who liked things the way they were and actively chased away the men who predominantly supported these things, all in the pursuit of some mythical audience that doesn't actually exist.  It can only be explained by an ideological madness that is willing to throw profits down the toilet in order to push an agenda.	[]

A point briefly mentioned that deserves much more attention is that these characters do NOT act like men, they act like caricatures of what deeply troubled Hollyweird women think masculinity is.  In effect it is a gender based minstrel show, with scowls instead of blackface.	"[""That's a good analogy for it. None of these characters feel like real people."", 'The conciseness is devastatingly revealing in this comment! Of course, we all knew that, or should have. ;D', 'I\'ve reflected on this over many years, each time I read about some woman ""acting like a man"" to prove a point or to write an article or something. Thing is, they never are. They end up aping what they think male behavior is - without ever understanding it - and always get it wrong. It ends up being the above-mentioned caricature instead.', 'Exactly,  I wonder who acts like this every time I see how men are depicted in media these times', 'Very well said']"
*Its pretty simple really, instead of trying to make a great film to entertain an audience, much of Hollywood have been trying to use film as a way to politically enculture an audience that does not exist. They say this loudly and often. They have faith based ideas about racism and sexism, and believe that their art form can be used as a tool of mass manipulation to steer culture towards their ends. They think black people are inferior and under represented, so they show blacks being superior and over represented. They think gays have been shamed in to obscurity, so they are making gay characters as loud and gay as possible. They think women are weaker than men and less competent than men on a host of issues, so they depict women as hyper competent at all things while being stronger than men. HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN SUBVERTED BY AN IDENTITARIAN CULT WHO ARE FACTUALLY MORE CONCERNED WITH SOCIAL ENGINEERING THAN MAKING GREAT FILMS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY (to them) MAKING MONEY. This is what Drinker means by ‚Äúthe message‚Äù. Showrunners will light a series on fire before it ever began, by having a presupposed value system that simply IS NOT WHAT AUDIENCES WANT TO SEE. This is where the idea of ‚Äúmodern audiences‚Äù come from. Hollywood is trying to sculpt a primitive audience in to a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù audience.  And in their eyes, a modern audience is one who thinks there‚Äôs too many whites, straights, and men in films. Films made primarily by straights, whites, and men. Rife with bigoted concepts, racist double standards baked in, and an insistence that identitarian politics is the highest value of all.*	[]

The problem is that the studios coming in, Amazon and Netlix are being run by activists. Occasionally a good show gets thru Amazon but not so much with Netflix.

As a woman who is opposite of the norm - don't like romcoms or typical chick flicks but LOVE action, adventure, scifi, mystery, and super hero genres, I hate what has been done to those genres. The girl boss trope is so boring bc they act like women are just smaller men but bc they are women, they can't have actual character growth or personal foibles bc they are a woman and apparent women are perfect? But perfect is boring. I do love a good female led show or movie in those genres (shout out to Star Trek Voyager and Captain Janeway!) but only if it is done well - and that means she is playing a real female character, not a character that could easily be a man or woman. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è These days it is a pleasant surprise when I find the rare recently produced movie or show in those genres that is still worth watching.	[]
I hope Disney just keeps going I want to see them shut down but that will probably never happen	[]
nope True Detective season 4, not a bad season and probably the best since season 1, but the girl boss motif was taken to such an absurd extreme it almost ruined the season for me	[]
"They had their chance at making interesting female leads and failed miserably. People don't generally like male characters because they're male; they like them they're actual written realistically and are allowed to have flaws without wildly overcompensating. There are and have been plenty of great female characters throughout cinema and I'd wager few to none of them were written by the same kinds of people responsible for stuff like Rings of Power or Captain Marvel.

Female characters are far too often written as Mary Sues who do no wrong and are just smarter and better than everyone without having to put in any work getting there and that's just a dreadfully boring trope in any medium, gender aside."	[]

I sure hope that both Marvel and Star Wars (Disney, basically) can come up with something to re-ignite their movies. They really need to, it is astonishingly how bad, lame and lowkey terrible their reputation has become in the last few years.

Largely irrelevant UNLESS people wake the F up and help push these companies off the financial cliff and completely reject the communist drivel they're indoctrinating you all with."	[]
2:18 So it's similar to what Bill Burr was saying about the WNBA. The women don't come out to watch/support it. That's their target audience but that target audience is not really that much interested. And then they expect the men to do the supporting for them...	[]

"Hollywood spent the last decade betting they could transform male dominated consumers/audiences by simply hijacking male-oriented products and modifying them for a *theoretical* female audience?

Contemplate the extreme hubris of people who believe that you can just ""Make the Force Female"" (for example) from the top down by simply creating a female-oriented product, and just the mere existence of that product would lead to a viable audience/consumer-base materializing from the void?

Can you imagine if Laureal learned that only 0.2% of their consumer-base was male, and because of that deciding that diversity and inclusion dictate that they must totally abandon their women's products to focus on a line of Male-oriented lipsticks and foundations?  
They'd be justifiably raked over the coals for a decision that massively stupid, and yet that is almost exactly what corporations like Disney have done with products like Star Wars, Doctor Who, The Lord of the Rings and the MCU."	[]
Don't these movies studios have focus groups? Did none of their focus groups of women suggest that the movie would flop?	[]

I just want to point out one extremely obvious point that everyone seems to be missing in Hollywood: When groups of Women get together and go for a night out, they don't go somewhere they have to sit together and remain silent for 2-3 hours like the bloody Cinema. - They go to Cafe's/Restaurants/Bars to talk with each other. Blokes, on the other hand, will happily go and watch a film with the boys because we don't have to discuss every detail of our lives every time we see each other. Attempting to get a majority female audience for a Super Hero film is like asking the ocean to fuck off for a bit so you can find Atlantis. Good luck, boyo.	[]

I remember back in the days the 2000s one franchise for example the fox Xmen movies did it best, they indeed had a equal amount of female and male characters, storm, Jean grey, rogue, mystique and plenty of diversity, and I bet if they gave a talented writer and director a chance to Give on of them a solo film, we would‚Äôve shown up, yet all in all they appealed to both men and woman as Hugh Jackmans wolverine was aloud to shine, they didn‚Äôt push the other female characters over Wolverine, they didn‚Äôt even comment on the Xmen name being oUtDaTeD cause it fucking isn‚Äôt, they made those team up films well, well Xmen 1,2, first class, dofp only. And you got idiots at marvel now wanting to remove the Xmen name, and change the focus to all its female characters, and make it look inclusive, the Xmen were always the most diverse and inclusive to both genders for decades. Basically Hollywood needs to return to the old ways and stop this new fucking dumb era they‚Äôre fine themselves in	[]

People care way less about what gender/identity the lead has for a movie, it just needs to be written well.

The Hunger Games series is a great example it was a series that was,
written by a woman, produced by a woman, and had a female lead. 
It's the 20th most grossing screenplay of all time at only 5 movies

Exactly. Well said. There's another factor at play here too and that is the perception by the major content producers that they needed to rope in younger viewers before they lose them forever to Twitch, TikTok and You Tube. I saw this same thing happen to the newspaper comic strip industry as it tried to skew new strip launches to younger audiences only to have it blow up in their faces when the internet gutted the print media. Now Film and Television is facing slow extinction from social media. Their lame attempt to appeal to a younger audience failed to take into account age and gender preferences and the fact that younger people don't constitute as big a part of the buying public as they thought it did.

My biggest problem with the aggressive push to include cultural or gender issues that have ZERO relevance to the established franchise and then accuse the people who don't like it as being racist, transphobic, homophobic, patriarchal, toxic males etc. Throwing out accusatory labels when the numbers back up the criticism and pushback only makes them dig their heels in harder. I want women included in prominent franchises and to have key roles to play when it works for the story, but to spin everything on its head for progressiveness' sake is stupid.	[]

Ripley from Alien was written extremely well and played to perfection by Sigourney Weaver back in 1979.  They had the perfect template for super strong female characters for over 40 years and yet they can't manage to bring themselves to do it.	"['There is the problem.\nRipley was not written as a woman at all in the first film. The characters femininity was just a side effect of being played by one.', ""Ripley didn't want to become a dumb fighter.  Nor would she, longer than it was necessary"", 'Exactly.  We even see her feminine, nurturing, and maternal side come out when she finds Newt.  Sarah Connor is another often cited example of a well written character in both Terminator films (there are only two).', 'maybe the issue is that aside Ripley and Sarah Connor (which are 40 year old characters) there hasent been anything good on the female side. Ok, follow my reasoning here for a bit, how many movies have male leads ? (a bunch right?) are they all winners ? No. Most of them arent but you know its the business, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Reeves, they all had movies bomb. So im saying, well lets female lead movies bomb, tinker with the formula, let there be girl bosses until you figure out how to make good ones. Just dont pander them like that, ""see we made an all girl movie"".', '@@ericfisher1360 Also another point, Its funny how they cant write strong female characters without inserting man hating into it lol.\nAll that talk about men ""not needing to be a  masculine man ,Just be a good person"" yet they themselves are incapable of being good people.\n\nMight have to just drop lady lead movies in general.']"

"I think it goes even beyond liking certain genres. For example, my girlfriend likes a lot of the MCU movies, especially the ""Thor"" ones (definitely playing a part in that is that Chris Hemsworth is her biggest ""celebrity crush"").

And guess what? She didn't care for ""The Marvels"" either. And why would she?

It's like those reports (that are hopefully inaccurate) about studio executives looking at the success of ""Barbie"" and coming to the conclusion that they should greenlight more movies based on toys.... as if +that+ was such an important element of the big box office.

And it's kinda similar regarding the idea of just shoving women into movies, without having good scripts and interesting characterization... and still expect female audiences to show up in large numbers, simply +because+ there are female leads.

This can obviously also be applied to something like having lead characters of other ethnicities/skin colours. Something like ""Fast & Furious"" works because while the ""diversity"" was noticeable, it didn't feel too forced.

(And this works the other way around as well. e.g. international productions which have the vast majority of its cast being ""foreign"" ... but cast some white Hollywood actor (quite often: b- or c-listers) in it for the sake of small name recognition and having a white star in it. Which also very often feels forced and weird)

I guess my point simply being: Something like ""The Marvels"" (or ""Madame Web"") might at least have worked significantly better if the studio had taken the time to actually gave the audiences (and maybe female audiences in particular) actual reasons to care about it."

Just give superhero a rest. Try to make movies with less CGI and more fight choreography! Also  historical pieces and swashbuckling  movies please Hollywood	[]
"Well said! As someone who's been working in marketing for 16 years, and having 4 in promoting film and TV content, I've always gotten the feeling that a good number of films were made without having done any market research. They don't know who exactly is their target market, or if there's enough of them to make it profitable.

Madame Web and the Sony Spider-verse was doomed from the start. Trying to make a cinematic universe around Spider-Man without actually having him in any of them is plain stupid. Nobody cares enough about the Sinister Six to want to see a film franchise revolved around them. Venom and Morbius would actually get a fair chance at succeeding if they were helmed by people who actually understood the characters. But instead we got a PG-13 Venom turned buddy comedy instead of a gritty, ruthless and amoral anti-hero. Where Morbius could have had a dark, gothic horror setting, it's turned into yet another generic and forgettable superhero. 

The funny part is, it's not like Sony was completely failing at it. The people who did the Miles Morales Spider-Verse movies were doing it far better than anything the Disney MCU was churning out in the last 5 years. Why didn't the execs behind Morbius and Madame Web learn something from those instead?"	"[""The sad thing is that Madame Web could have setup a great series of movies featuring The Inheritors, yet doesn't seem to have succeeded at that. At this point I think Disney just need to hand Sony a blank cheque and get them to fill it in with what it'll take to get ownership of Spider-Man back."", 'Movies today (and likely always) are made in board rooms, not on sets. It\'s just business, like sports has become. So, nothing ""personal ""dear audiences, about feeding you carp; besides, you would not understand. Now look at all the cool CGI we have for you kiddies! What? Writing? Character development? Geeezuz, don\'t make us laugh, ...that\'s a good one!! @@voteDC', ""@@voteDCMadame Web simply didn't make sense to be the centerpiece of a superhero franchise, given her comic book origins as a supporting character who can't even walk. The whole idea of a Spider-Man cinematic universe that doesn't actually have Spider-Man in it is a terrible idea to begin with. How long did Sony think they could keep making references to Spidey when audiences already know he's never going to show up because of contractual reasons?"", ""@@tcchip Which is why I said Disney need to give Sony a blank cheque.\n\nThe current Madame Web in the comics is a former Spider-Woman called Julia Carpenter. Given that Disney don't mind skipping iterations of a character (jumping straight to the Carol Danvers Captain Marvel for example) there's no reason she couldn't have been used in a movie"", ""@@voteDC this isn't just about money, but egos. Sony won't ever sell back the rights to the Spider-Man and related film rights to Marvel at any price. Movies like Madame Web and Morbius exist solely to prevent the rights from expiring and returning to Marvel by default. \n\nEven when Sony got a massive amount of revenue share by allowing Spider-Man in the MCU, they're still determined to keep any direct collaboration with Marvel to a minimum because they'd rather be the ones to make a Spidey movie, regardless of whether it's good or bad.""]"

"A feminine woman can be strong and capable. These women writers are sending the message, through example, that a woman can't be capable or strong if she's feminine and kind.

Men like feminine women who are capable. We love them! Find a video on YouTube of a woman being capable in a task that men are usually doing and count how many men in the comments are expressing how attracted they are to them or may even be proposing lol

These women aren't masculine, they're just capable.

After seeing the trailer for Borderlands today, this trend is still going.

This is such an old fashioned and dumb take. This movie failed because it was a bad movie, no one saw it men, women and everyone in between. Loki is a male super hero who is very popular with female viewers. The problem isn‚Äôt having strong female leads, but the fact that the current writers have no idea how to do that. Look at books as opposed to films, there we have a just as many strong females as males, and there isn‚Äôt the same problems. Did you ever stop to think that maybe an industry that went from me too to pandering to women and always showing them on top, might be over compensating? They might just be, rather than actually showing their true feminist values, just showing how totally okay with women we are now üòú.  If they wanted to put forward feminist values they would put forward feminist values from today, not ones from the 70‚Äôs. I swear there isn‚Äôt a single person in Hollywood that has read a current feminist book, and instead of addressing that you‚Äôre basically saying that films should be segregated? No. This is that same B.S that women should be watching romance and men should be watching action. All of that is so old fashioned and honestly media should be better then that, and so should we.	"[""I've saw where you said you were disabled, did you mean mentally disabled?

Targeted media is always very derivative why can‚Äôt we get something a little more complicated? Is it too much to ask that maybe there is something in between? Maybe just maybe a woman doesn‚Äôt need to be a damsel in distress or a girl boss and a man doesn‚Äôt need to be an action hero or a cowering mess. Maybe if major studios started writing people more true to real life then a lot of this would become less of an issue, because it isn‚Äôt when I‚Äôm reading books, and to be honest it isn‚Äôt an issue when I‚Äôm watching movies that aren‚Äôt American, or even produced by a major Hollywood studio.  @@SupremeBeyonder']"

"One of my favorite movies, and one of my favorite quotes in that movie, I believe, applies to this topic of conversation.

In the movie, La La Land, Mia tells Sebastian ‚Äúpeople love what other people are passionate about..‚Äù that statement is absolutely true. You don‚Äôt have to belittle anyone or ostracize any part of your audience in order for them to find your product appealing. You simply have to produce a product that you truly love and are passionate about and people will flock to it, and spend their hard earned money for it. Regardless, if they are male or female. Take music, for example. I can‚Äôt tell you how many concerts I‚Äôve gone to where I assumed that because of the nature of the music being played, there would be more of one sex than the other in attendance only to show up and find out that both men and women can enjoy the same style of music equally. Both men and women were in the mosh pit, shoving each other just for fun and fucks sake. And it doesn‚Äôt seem like the artist up on stage is trying to pander to one more than the other. They‚Äôre simply playing what they love, and they are sharing that with others and people like myself have shown up and purchased tickets with our hard earned money to enjoy the product.

Movie studios used to be about this. They used to be about making films that were passionate and made with love. They weren‚Äôt thinking about pandering to women only or to men only. You could honestly say that the original lion King panders to both men and women. And even to children, which is why it is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The themes could be applied to any sex and to any age. And all sexes love this movie equally. 

I‚Äôm not for putting either sex on a pedestal. I don‚Äôt believe men should be put on a pedestal, and I don‚Äôt believe women should be put on a pedestal. We‚Äôre different than one another, but we are both deserving of dignity and respect. Marvel studios should aim to make movies that treat both their male and female audience with respect and dignity. Men are strong and capable, and so are women, but we just go about it differently and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Marvel Studios needs to go back to making superhero movies, about flawed superhuman characters that have to STRUGGLE with legitimate internal and external issues, and have to fight to overcome those odds against all odds and us, as an audience, can see their transformation on screen, and perhaps even walk away, inspired to do the same in our own lives. The greatest movies ever made are those that have had a transformative experience on their audience. Films that inspired the next generation to become better versions of themselves, or to become the filmmakers of tomorrow, or to become the actors of nowadays, or to become better leaders, or a better friend, or a better teammate, or be more resolved to stand firm in the face of challenges and opposition."

Sigourney Weaver's Ripley stands out to me (a 40-something male) as one of the greatest heroes in film.  She's realistic - someone with fears, weaknesses, and flaws, like all real humans of any sex or gender.  However, when push came to shove, she channeled all she had to come through in the end, while at nearly every disadvantage.  Ripley isn't a girlboss.  Ripley is a badass.  Not because she was super athletic, supremely confident, or any other crap like that, but because she was none of those things yet prevailed because of sheer nerve and wits.  That is identifiable and inspiring.  That's what can be achieved with good writing, directing, and acting.	"[""And more importantly, she exists in the sci fi action genre, which is predominantly appealing to males. So you can make a successful action movie with a female lead. James Cameron paved the way 40 years ago on how to do it but studios today don't get it."", ""The thing is a character can only be smart as their writer and there aren't many smart writers left even if they are out there these companies aren't hiring them because you know they don't exactly hire based on talent anymore...

It's such a fundamental rule, how on earth did Disney F this up? üôÑ"	"['Speaking from complete ignorance of ""business school"" here, that marketing advice might be good if your product is, say, _plastic forks_ but Disney is supposed to be the ""Dream Factory"" - they _do_ create it and wish it into existence (or they should). Franchise spinoffs, yes I guess they are equivalent to plastic forks, but in the case of the original material how do you ask your target audience what they want, when, hopefully, they have never seen the like before?', 'ESG and DEI hiring practices is also the root cause of this debacle. They started hiring people to tic boxes and not on merit and the end result is a bad product.', '@@gagatube You can choose to remain ""ignorant"" if you like, but my 40 years in sales and marketing selling much more than plastic forks trumps mere opinion. Read any book on marketing and it will tell you the same. Even a basic ""How to start a YouTube channel"" will tell you the first step is always to identify your target audience. He literally just explained it in the video. You simply make different movies for each audience. It ain\'t rocket science. You can come up with the most ""original"" musical romance ever made, it\'s still not going to attract a primarily male audience and vice-versa. Disney\'s problem is they are pushing an agenda that completely flies in the face of actual data and it clearly isn\'t working.', 'The movie industry is controlled by old women who live in delulu land', ""@@gagatube Okay, then let's rephrase it. The audience definitely has shown Disney and other creative endeavours what they DON'T want. Yet they still produce it. \n\nAnd come on, the artists who made the old classic Disney animation did so with having in mind what appeals to children. Also, limitations is what makes creativity flourish.""]"
Concise and effectively argued. Money talks - hopefully louder than the inaccurate beliefs studios have been operating by. Otherwise, smart money just needs an upstart to invest in.	[]

The problem is, even if this all turned out to be true, it's too late. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Patrick Stewart... all the actors that made their roles good are way too old or dead. The chance was ten years ago and it is forever wasted. You can't turn back time on that. Even if all of the dumb shit is retconned out of beloved franchises that have been systematically destroyed, you can't undo the passage of time and the ageing and dying that comes with it. We will never have a reunification with our three heroes in Star Wars. Picard will never be Captain of the Enterprise again.	[]

The melting pot of entertainment is lose-lose for everyone in the same way a potluck would kinda suck if all the unique dishes, sides, beverages, finger foods, and desserts were all dumped together into a big stewing sludge pot and distributed in cups. Sure, there'd be a few sickos who like it, but the time, care and effort put into each anticipated, savory, contribution is wasted for the sake of banal, boring, efficiency.	[]
I have always thought there are plenty of common ground in men and women entertainment. Why not just make good action scenes instead of trying to attract women, or men, or kids or something. I haven't seen anyone turn down a good sakuga, regardless of who's in it.	[]

"My wife and I used to go to the movies pretty often, usually at least once a month, sometimes 2-3x if there was a strong batch of films. We signed up for a movie club app and all that.

Right around 2019 or so, we really slowed down. Movies that looked interesting only popped up every few months.

I think we have been to the movies once or twice since 2020. She had zero interest in the girlboss films targeted at her, and I had no interest in paying to be talked down to.

She's also a huge Disney fan. Classic Disney. She hasn't cared for anything they have put out for the past few years now. 

She's also hispanic and bisexual. Literally the exact demographic they are targeting. 

Disney has utterly failed."	['Writing across the board is really bad.']

It‚Äôs not having female leads in traditionally male preference movie genres that‚Äôs the problem.  Movies like Termjnator/T2, Alien, and Long Kiss Goodnight were good movies that just happened to have a female lead. And men went to watch them.	[]
"Slight correction...it's not that the studios are ""chasing an audience that doesn't exist""; its worse: they actually believed that they could create that audience. Hollywood really and truly believes that they are THE force that drives the cultural soul of humanity on a global scale.  (Of course the rest of us understand that when Hollywood picks up a fad, that jig has well and truly played itself out in the real world.)"	[]
The problem is people that market these films forget how biology works, they are brainwashed into the new way of thinking. What men like to watch is very different to females. You will get some cross over. But in general women might only go to an action film with their partner. I dragged my wife to all the phase 1 mcu films and she even enjoyed them. BUT we both agreed the new stuff is terrible. I cant even bring myself to watch the marvels on Disney even for a laugh.	[]
I'm quite happy to watch a female superhero movie but modern writers write complete drivel, presumably because they think 'Modern Audiences' are all morons, which they really (Mostly) aren't! So the recent theme of producing worse and worse female led superhero movies is idiotic and can only have been done because the movie production companies have no understanding of their own customers.

"Perfect examples of a strong female (and she is as iconic as her famous line ""IM A HOUSE WIFE!"") Mrs. Izumi Curtis from Full Metal Alchemist.

She actually managed to survive in a frozen tundra for a few months by straight up stealing the food from a military base that was nearby ü§£ü§£ü§£ she fucking crazyü§£ü§£ but she is a wonderful teacher. Wonderful person. And she married her bear of a husband Zeke. Like seriously her husband is over six feet tall and three hundred pounds of bear-throwing muscle. 

Theyre not wealthy nor are they poor. They own a butcher shop. Theyre happy. Zeke takes care of her after a failed resurrection of their infant child(who died shortly after being born) basically mutilated Izumis entire reproductive system. 

She never let that stop her despite the fact that she really really cant do much without vomiting blood. Losing their kid was devastating. But even after everything theyve been through. Their marriage is rock solid."	[]

While a lot of Marvel MCU stuff has been crap lately I really liked Loki s2. It was all about him and not Sylvia. He had reasons to try and be better but also still felt like the trickster God he is. The writing felt genuine instead of trying to pander to anyone. The ending felt like a good bookend for him. If it's the last we see of him then I'm ok with it. Even if I would like to see him saved by our Thor.	[]

"Drinker, you touch on something big without fully articulating what's really going on.  Hollywood doesn't see movies as entertainment. It sees them as a form of social conditioning.  You rightly point out they're not producing entertainment that appeals to the audience's preferences, but to Hollywood that's a *feature* not a bug.  Hollywood is telling the audience it *must* like what it's producing or the audience is ""bad"" or ""wrong"" with the usual trope of -ists and -phobes.

This is no longer entertainment.  It's propaganda.  And it deserves to crash and burn."	[]
"""The girlboss concept is dead."".  Hopefully, because it was never more than an ill-contrived love child of wokeism and myopia that had its ass handed to it by the real world.

"If they would stop trying to make movies ""for men"" or ""for women"" and instead focused on making.. I dunno... A GOOD MOVIE, then they wouldn't have to worry about overanalyzing the audience demographics to try to crack some nonexistant code.  People aren't going to see these movies because they suck.  Period.  I know I'm in the minority, but as a woman I used to really enjoy action and superhero movies, and now they are unwatchable.  It's like you say, it's the relentless PANDERING that is taking center stage, and any attempt at making a ""superhero"" or ""action"" movie comes second to that.  I'm all for ""female empowerment"" but when corporate suits try to use that as a way to artificially infuse entertainment with a false sense of forced messages, it just ruins the message AND the entertainment.  I'll be so glad when this trend is finally buried and gone."	[]

She has to play with Kurt in a way that will make Kurt burn energy, as if he is seriously chasing his prey to hunt and kill it. Maybe put something on a stick on a string that Kurt likes to swat at and have them do that for a good 15 or 20 minutes. I think she made the mistake of coming at Kurt when he was not too tired to keep on hunting so even though we had energy to still swat at a toy instead she offered her hand to pet him and he was too riled up and also on catnip. Try again, and make sure he's good and tired out before you try to pet him. Also, maybe offer your hand lower or from behind him when he's tired, so it does not look like you're still trying to get him to swat at your hand. Another thing try sitting quietly. It might not make a great video, but after a good hunt and then, after a good meal, it might be time for Kurt to do some grooming and then just relax and take a nap. He can take a nap next to her or on her lap, perhaps.	[]

All this occurred while the show was surprisingly more progressive than I remembered, especially taking themes on race, religion, gender, sexuality, etc.

It's like I have said for a while now, you CAN have fantastic movies with a strong female that, if well written, can become an amazing piece of fiction. Take the first two Terminator films and Alien. Sara Connor and Ripley are some of the toughest hero characters in all of movie history! BOTH female and both kick ass! But they had to endure hell to get to that point.

Drinker, you managed to summarize the entire situation beautifully in a less than 10 minute video.  Billions of dollars have been lost on movies that no one (and I mean no one) ever asked to see.

I'll drink to that!	[]
I do wonder if your conclusion is a little optimistic Drinker. I force myself to watch Barbie just to see what the fuss was about.

Do not like romances or musicals. Love super hero movies. Don't care who leads but do care about the personality of the lead character. If there is no personality to connect to, male or female, then it sucks to watch and is boring.  Not going to the movie for a spiritual awakening. Just want to be entertained and you need good writing and an interesting character to get that accomplished.	[]

"Makes you consider how completely sexist this experiment has been. They've fucked all the content men enjoy to appeal to the wokies, but haven't touched the female content to try and rope in men.

That's why you get grey goo for movied - beige bland movies the radicals that have taken over think not only everyone should like, but which everyone MUST like, or it's the gulag for you.  I really liked this breakdown, especially the citation on BFI genre-gender-age correspondence analysis.  Not only are the correspondence analyses interesting in and of themselves, but it's interesting to see BFI walk away from the idea of gender over the years, undoubtedly due to political pressure inside and out.  They still surprisingly managed to make release a correspondence analysis in 2019, though (the one you show in your clip).  It's not really changed over the years, in spite of inorganic pressures from the outside to make it so."	[]

Firing the writers and announcing a more male-focused approach is great and all, but I'm still going to presume the worst when I see any female-led show/movie in that genre these days.

Give us a strong male lead who is actually competent and isn't outshone by every female in the cast and then we'll talk.	[]

A great example is Star Trek Voyager with Captain Janeway vs Star Trek Discovery with Michael Burnam. One is beloved and the other is‚Ä¶ ummm‚Ä¶ there‚Ä¶	"['One is a leader, who commands her ship with good training, a strong force of will, and a decent amount of logic (Janeway). The other is a psychopath and borderline Mary Sue who in any actual organization like Starfleet would have been arrested and locked up for the crap she pulls (Burned Ham).', ""And i found funny how they took an already inclusive IP with plenty of diversity, and just extremized all this inclusion to a point of not being inclusive anymore.\n\nEvery old star trek had great strong female characters, a crew of all different ethnicities and characters you could relate with (Obrian i love you).\nDiscovery have just a girlboss not human deus ex captain who does everything, everyone it's gay, inclusion = black people, and everyone just cry and have emotional breakdown. There is not a single characters i could relate with. The doctor or data are more human than the whole cast of discovery"", 'Captain Janeway is the best written ‚Äústrong female‚Äù lead IMO. Absolutely loved voyager growing up', ""STD is a bit of an std that you can't get rid of..."", ""Don't forget about Seven of Nine! A great character played by an awesome actress! (And I'm a straight female, so no, not dazzled by her ... assets). \n\nI'd throw in Kira Nerys and Jadzia Dax into the mix, too. They were awesome female characters in Trek, too. Voyager had its issues, but what I liked is that Janeway was never put on a pedestal. She made questionable decisions, and was challenged on it. \n\nI have not seen discovery, but the snippets were enough. Also, why is she called Michael?! What's the point of that?! She was raised by Vulcans. Certainly to them it's illogical to have a male name for a female as that just causes confusion.""]"

"Having a strong female character and a strong male character and treat them equally isn't enough. Let's not forget the fundamentals : good script, good actors, good director and team.
Case point : The not-really-good 80's movie ""Red Sonja"".
So, yep, let's not forget that Hollywood started experimenting with the ""strong female lead"" formula a long time ago, with widely varying degrees of success.

Also, Hollywood should finally understand that having an all-female team behind the scenes do not magically equal to a great success, whether it's on TV or the big screen. You also need someone who understands the target audience.
Case point : Darren Star, who's very much a guy, was the driving force behind some of the most popular TV series among women.
I think we'll all agree that Melrose Place and Sex and the City were not made for a male audience in mind. Right?"	[]
Disney has always made Princess movies and thought it never needed to do anything else. When it purchased new franchises, it assumed they could just make more Princess movies. The problem is that their Princess movies were always really written poorly. The only they had going for them, and the only thing that carried them, was the music. The writers were there just to tie the songs together. Disney assumed it could swap music sets with action pieces and nobody would notice. They still refuse to learn how to write. THIS I think is the main problem. Certainly, the gender wars play a part but it's symptomatic and not the main problem. I know there's lots of traction to be had with the gender wars but you're really missing the point here i think and just doing easy pandering...following the lead of Disney in claiming that it's just a gender thing.

I'm gonna have to fight you Drinker my dude. I'm a 39yo woman who was raised by a first gen Trekkie mother, weaned on Next Gen mainly, and growing into Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, X-Files, Farsce, Firefly, Stargate, Battlestar Galactica etc etc. Always very into science fiction and fantasy, and now raising my daughters the same. They are 7 and 5, and already *way* more into Star Wars than Barbie. And I have to say, science fiction and fantasy properties have always showcased remarkable and inspiring women. The problem with modern media is not that they are trying to shunt women into male properties. The female characters have always been there, and the female fans have always been there. The problem is that they are trying to turn women into men. And not just men, *shit* men. While degrading the male characters! Give me 90s and early 2000s sci-fi all. Day.	['Same. I grew up with Star Wars/Trek/Gate. I love Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. That‚Äôs not to say that I wouldn‚Äôt watch a well written romance movie, though. But Barbie? Nope.

The cinema is a reflection of our North American culture. The problem is that there is a very vocal minority that is calling the shots because the nice majority turns the other cheek and allows it. It is in all aspects of our pop culture these days. There needs to be a large societal shift before things actually get better. The silent majority is not a monster consumed with bigotry and hate. We just don't believe what the vocal minority believes and would appreciate them not forcing it down our throats.	[]
So lets look at movie goer audiences... single males that want super hero movies based on the actual comics they grew up with; men taking women out on dates paying for the movie and wanting to spend money on what they want to see too; families who have little kids who want to see super hero movies based on the actual comics they are reading. It's not that difficult Hollywood	[]
Add to that, we women who liked the action franchises as they were liked them the way they were. We didn't need them feminized or girl-bossed or whatever it was they thought they were doing to them.

Everyone needs to stop thinking that men and women think alike. We just don't. It has been proven scientifically through scanning our brains and looking at how the brains of each biological sex responds differently to the same stimulation.	[]
Heck, its not even the presence of female superheroes or even female writers that ruin these movies.

Also, most of the women at an action movie are there with a man who wanted to see it, as most of the menat a romantic movie are there with a woman who wanted to see it. The best of each type know their primary audience, but also show some appreciation to their secondary audience. (What guy doesn't love the scene where the guys are sobbing over The Dirty Dozen?)

"Slight tweak on this argument. Bad writing is bad writing. Pandering often predicts bad writing, and a lot of the content being produced these days is pandering, and strays from the source material.

My favorite action hero ever is Ellen Ripley, a badass in a SciFI / Horror / Action genre which per the chart is right in the ""male interest zone"". Other examples: Rita in Edge of Tomorrow, Alita Battle Angel, ""Major"" in Ghost in the Shell, Furiosa in Mad Max, Sarah Connor in The Terminator 2. . . The point is using to a well-written characters, developed in a good story, which usually comes from sticking to the source material. This often means showing weakness overcome by perseverance - which BTW also makes for great male heroes."	[]

So... it's a fallacy to state that women want to see a female lead with a female cast.  I argue that most women want to see some hot guys in tight clothing.  My wife sure does and when I'm not wearing my suit she satiates your desires by watching super hero movies.  In fact most women DON'T want to see sniveling women in anything.  This isn't complicated.  So many, like most people, just don't give a rats ass about watching poorly written women Mary Janes on any screen.  It's tired, unpalatable and frankly toxic.	[]

I worked in Hollywood studios from 1999-2019. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs gone wrong : in the old days , a studio boss or the executive shepherding the project HAD TO LIKE IT - seriously; it didn‚Äôt have to be ‚ÄúCitizen Kane‚Äù but they had to really dig it on some level. (Audiences were not ignored : of course there were always test screenings - but the idea was ‚Äúhow do we make the thing WE like into something THEY love?‚Äù). Then, around 2013, someone decided ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to like the project, we need to convince ourselves they THEY will like it - so we‚Äôll just change how we think !‚Äù. And the problem with that is : when nobody on the team really truly likes the project, everyone goes home at 5pm and you end up where we are now‚Ä¶‚ù§	"['Interesting, thank you for the insight into the industry.', 'or woke marxism tropes    either or', ""It's like Norm Macdonald said, in order to do a good parody, you have to like the person.

Well, the feminist and the women who are obsessed with all women casts are the minority of women.  Most women don‚Äôt care.  We just wanna see good movies.  I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs an all male cast.  If it‚Äôs good, I wanna see it.  If I see that a movie is gonna be all about pushing the feminist agenda, I‚Äôm not gonna watch it.	[]
Got to be honest, if the marvels were gendered swapped and somehow worked the cats into the actual plot, it would have been a better movie.	[]
The girlboss won't be removed, they'll just be rebranded and less pronounced until one day, they'll come back as obnoxious as ever once the audience has adapted to the concept.  The undertones will always be there and I will continue to not watch modern films because I know that these Woke ideologues will never change and the good people out there aren't willing to fight back against them.  I've given up on films and I suggest, for everyone elses' sanity, does the same.  Just stop going to movie theaters, stop watching trailers, stop consuming.  The powers that be make these to insult you, stop taking the bait.	[]

That Jigsaw comment seems to be pretty accurate. But I also think this is about changing societal norms, so the activists at these studios KNOW they're making flops - but they're making flops people will see and be influenced by - and therefore it's worth the loss of cash.

"Thank you for this video! So well-put! As a woman, I like mostly the male genres, altho I do enjoy a good musical or romance. 

I do appreciate well-written characters, male or female, who can kick butt, but I would like a female one to actually be a bit feminine in her raits. Both Widow and Gamorah were basically men with breasts, altho by no means to the degree of, say, Rey Palpatine or Captain Marvel (the character (ahem, shapeless blob of goo) I detest most in all of cinema.) Sje should have a little nurturing instinct, a way about her of encouraging those around her to step beyond their perceived boundaries (such as Astrid from HttYD or Eowyn from LotR, or Peggy Carter, who pushed Steve forward.) Even Black Widow had some womanliness to her. Bring back the real women!"	[]

"Men go to action/adventure/fantasy for a first person experience, but women go for a second person experience. 

To explain, men imagine the events of the story happening to them, the protagonist. Women imagine the protagonist happening to them. 

That's why more women went to see Aquaman than Cpt Marvel. Women didn't want to imagine themselves as CPT Marvel as much as they want to imagine Jason Mamoa Happening to them."	[]
"I HIGHLY doubt Hollywood is learning any lessons. I suspect what will happen is a restructuring of ""the message""; maybe make it a bit less on the nose and more subtle. They've been trying to simply jam it down our collective throat, but now they've come to accept that method won't work."	[]

Where did they get the idea that pushing as many women into the project, especially into the cast, would make it more appealing to women? If anything, I'd attract men who want to see good looking women. Girls just want to watch handsome charismatic guys, that's just the way it is.	[]

One of the things I find the most funny is that one of the ways the movies would pander to women that showed up was to put a romance in there. So much so that I as a 47 year old man kind of started to appreciate one being there since it made the characters more relatable and human even in action or genre movies. But being sexless and completely immune to romantic gestures is apparently exactly how you make movies for women. Heck you could even put in a romance between two women or something, anything... but nope. None of those mushy things. Only angry women and idiot or inconsequential men, preferably men with more successful franchises behind them where they did have romances.	[]

"As a female fan of fantasy and superhero movies, I'm sick of them always having the same girlboss and the same plot about how she's already great and the men around her suck. These female characters have no character development, which makes the ""useless males"" more likeable and sympathetic by default. I'm fine with male or female leads, so long as they're flawed, interesting characters who learn and grow, and aren't created just to appease ""the message."""	[]

"It's not about men or women's preferences. It's about genuinity. When you go out of your way to try to pander to ANY audience, the product starts to feel artificial and formulaic. Top Gun is ""We're gonna write a story about a man being a man in a man's world,"" not ""let's capitalize on male audiences."" Lots of women LOVE Top Gun. Maverick isn't some infallable, inhumanly perfect, epitome of ultimate manhood. He's just a regular dude who has a tendency to push the envelope but has a well-intentioned heart. That's a realistic, genuine character. Hell, he's even visibly shorter than a lot of other guys in the series and gets thrown out of a bar by a boss woman character lol. There's not a poorly-camoflauged narrative of trying to prove some bigger point like ""Men are superior"" or some bs. It's just a fun story that's not trying to be anything more than a fun story, and that's the genuinity we've been missing from Marvel and Disney these past years. I think Hallmark movies are cheesy, but the same principle of just being a fun story applies there too, and they're practically a staple in our society now.

This new-age ""free love, strength in diversity, female empowerment"" movement has a philosophy of trying to use every platform possible to bluntly assert itself, and decrying any platforms that won't submit. Even death metal music of all places took a hit last summer when Thy Art Is Murder's singer got fired for making a public stance against parents who convince their young children to be trans. It used to be a genre of young, dumb, ignorant kids writing the most vulgar, obscene, misogynistic, edgy lyrics to over-the-top brutal, technical, heavy music. We loved it, not because we ""agreed"" with the lyrics or anything, but because everyone knew it wasn't serious and was just a genre about having light-hearted fun making ridiculous music. Thy Art's breakout song in like 2006 was literally called ""Whore to a Chainsaw"" lolol, and it fing slaps. My point is that this operational philosophy of ""It's the girl's/gay's/other color's/[fill in the blank]'s turn now, time for the white hetero cis men to leave"" has caused the same problems in a lot of spaces, superhero films only being one of them.

In the realm of heavy music, we love bands like Spiritbox and Jinjer, which are female-lead bands that still just try to make good music and don't pander to ""girl's turn"" bs or call of their haters misyongists. Meanwhile, Butcher Babies has become irrelevant because ""LOOK AT OUR HOT SINGERS"" was literally the only thing going for them. Their riffs suck and their music isn't fresh at all, and no social justice movement has come to save them. The former are genuinely good bands, the latter is genuinely not, and in a genuine game, that's just how it goes. That's the idea Hollywood's strayed away from. That's the game this movement disrupts."	[]
"What about the idea of taking a ""Girl Boss"" type character and having her slowly learn that it's okay to show emotions and be vulnerable? That this doesn't make her weaker but stronger?

It might be a fallacious take, as it's merely a metaphor, but when my buddy was talking about the current mediatic state and was wondering why people were looking away from the franchises that worked so well in the past, I illustrated it with a bigmac (TM) for him. Imagine you order one and get something wildly different. Then the restaurant asserts to you this is what you ordered and paid for. But it tastes, looks and smells nothing like what you came to get and expected. This is the current formula from the media: sell you something different with the name you came for labelled on it...and then they wonder why customers are pissed or confused and why the product doesnt work...	"[""I ordered a Big Mac, but this is a Filet of fish. No it's not.

"‚ÄúInstead of writing likable and distinctly feminine characters that complement the existing male ones, the writers and creatives treated more like a competition that only one side was ever allowed to win.

It's not that they've been forcing female led films on the public. It's that they've been forcing terribly written female led films on the public. There's a ton of women out there who hate films like Barbie and LOVE sci fi/action films.

"[""Exactly his point the girl boss is the part which is bad writing, none of the great female leads of the past acted in such a way or gained random powers to move the story on.\nThink of like Jamie lee Curtis in true lies for instance, smashed the role but didn't turn into a super spie that could put Arny in an arm bar.""]"
I believe a big part of this is feminism and the need to latch onto anything that is popular JUST because it's popular. And they continue to absorb anything they can get their paws onto in hopes of grasping more power. And then it fails because it turns out they know nothing about it or what made it into what it was. Although at least on a smaller scale on more individual level I believe a part of this because certain females latch onto these things in search for a sense of belonging. It's a bit awkward liking things that are prominently liked by the opposite sex. And then when people say it's primarily for the opposite sex it makes you think you don't belong there and you're the weird one. But instead of just accepting that you're the odd one out, they instead try to prove people wrong by getting all women to like it. And they think that if they make it have more women and more feministic talking points this will gather more women. And so try to turn superhero films into Barbie.	[]
About Madame Web, the only thing that got me interested in the movie is the fact Sydney Sweeney is in it, and she's supposed to wear a tight suit.

"Great points! An all-female superhero movie is like an all-male romance movie ... and we know how Bros went down, so to speak.   

Would an an all-male musical succeed, with all male lead characters (with female villains) and all male writers and directors?

Today corporations have become so huge, they wield the influence of an arm of the government, and they increasingly act that way. 

As Frank Zappa pointed out, the best arts executives were old-school cigar-chompers who only cared about success.

"I honestly think that at the root of all this is the belief that women can be socially engineered into wanting to major in STEM subjects.

See, the wizards behind the curtain only really worry about men abandoning higher education, because modern society is built on science, technology, engineering and math, and they're very worried enough people aren't pursuing those disciplines. If we don't have enough engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and the like, a prosperous society we won't have. Keeping this house of cards upright requires people, mostly men, with STEM degrees who can seemingly do magic to mere mortals and can create a flying machine with some wood, rags, and a few other items out in the garage.

Well, because these _wizards behind the curtain_ trying to run society are often the same people who believe gender differences are socially engineered, it's no stretch to also conclude they'd think that the reason men sought out those subjects was because entertainment that focused on science and technology was male dominated. I'm certain they thought if they made shows with a bunch of _girlbosses_ then maybe girls would seek out STEM degrees. If girls got STEM degrees, it wouldn't matter to society if men were going GALT in western culture.

"This is why CD is the best reviewer on the net. (Even if I like some of the movies he shits on). 
He understands the underlying psychology of what people want to see.
While his fellow conservative reviewers were shiting on Barbie for its ""man-hating propaganda"" he understood that it was a movie perfectly pitched to a specific audience that was guaranteed to succeed.
  
Simply put. It was not made for a majority male audience, so men complaining about it is akin to women complaining about ""toxic males"" in classic action flicks.
Now of course men and women do cross over and no audience is 100% on either side, but the corporate world has lost sight of its target audience and is trying to force a square peg into a round hole. 

It was always doomed to fail."	[]

"Okay, Drinker, you make good points. But I‚Äôd like to throw in something else: The age of audiences. See, to us Boomers, a lot of these movies just have no real appeal. Barbie? Meh. Top Gun? Meh. These are, to many of us, just kid movies made by and for kids, and we don‚Äôt see ourselves or our lives in them. When I was in my 20s, stuff like Star Wars was exciting and fun. Now it‚Äôs nostalgia, and that isn‚Äôt present in the latest Star Wars Episode CXIII or whatever that is all about kids and bad-mouthing an old Obi-Wan or Luke Skywalker.

So what do we want? Probably a lot of things. But moviemakers could start by making movies where people our age aren‚Äôt just the old jokes or creeps that everyone blames for all the problems in the world, and who did heroic things and who have things of value to say. Where are the movies for us?"	[]

While comparing how Barbie and Top Gun made bank because they worked to appeal to their target audience, I want to throw Super Mario Bros Movie into the ring. It didn't have the deepest plot, but it was packed with tons of references to the video games, including a section all about Mario Kart. The target audience was primarily video game players, who had grown up playing Mario games. And it did incredibly well because of that.	"[""In the case of Mario it was likely also kids wanting parents to take them and for a change it was safe to. As for Barbie I think that was helped by sneaky marketing that hid from parents the messages in Barbie would bore the pants off the daughters who nagged to go as well as plenty of women who went for the nostalgia but got a lesson in the type of feminism HW just loves which they loathed. But it did get their bums on the seats first. Not sure it'll work as well the next time but some women loved it.""]"

My wife has gone to plenty of superhero movies over the years...because I wanted to see the movies. Once Hollywood started to treat me as the enemy, I stopped going to their movies. But instead of my wife going in my absence, she also stopped going because it was less fun to see a movie if we weren't both going (and because these diversity written, directed and acted movies SUCKED). So good going, Hollywood, by humiliating males and banning them from lead roles, you lost not only most of the male audience but also the much of the female audience as well. I am genuinely amazed that Hollywood, who has been making movies for over a century, is too dumb to have figured this out on their own.	[]

With the exception of the Spiderverse sequel and Guardians 3, I haven't watched a Marvel movie in 5 years. At first I just didn't care, because I was exhausted and thought they could use a break.

Disney's just really not been on a role as of late, and I'm just not buying what they're selling. If I hear that something they put out is actually good, maybe I'll come check it out.

"Well said.  But a few anecdotal points. 1) I love seeing women kick ass, maybe more than men.  If given a choice in video games, I'll often play as female. Not only do I enjoy looking at women more than men, I enjoy the underdog aspect. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this. 2) My wife went insane over Top Gun: Maverick.  Probably because she likes watching competent male heroes kick ass as much as men do. 3) My favorite ""nerd property"" media of the last 5 years has probably been Arcane - which on paper is inclusive to excess, but nothing feels shoehorned because the writing is so good and the characters are all interestingly flawed.  I guess my point is less ""let boys be boys and girls be girls"", but make quality films with smart writing and compelling characters and stories, and you're going to find that more of both genders gravitate towards those regardless of genre.  And JHC, yes, women writers are fully able to write stories that appeal to everyone, and the assumption that they can't is one studios (and critics) need to stop making."	[]

"I think a major cause of this is also the increasing success of asian content at the detriment of the Hollywood stuff.

 Hear me out: you can think all you want of k-dramas or anime, but they make big numbers today. In the past, hell five years ago even, you could say there was no competition. But distribution has changed, and when the money men at Amazon see that people would rather watch the new k-drama of the day than Rings of Power on Prime, they're bound to ask themselves some questions.

 With anime is the same thing. What do they have that western products don't? Two words: target demographics. Traditionally entertainment, at least in Japan, caters to groups of consumers based on their age, gender and interests. So much so, that even genres are named according to that (""shojo"" probably being the most famous example).

So the lesson for West entertainment is: if you refuse to give the people what they want, somebody else will."	"[""Shounen is the common style of manga or anime that appeals to adolescent boys and young men and makes up the majority of Japanese heavy hitters. Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Naruto, Pokemon, and Demon Slayer are all shounen. They typically boil down to power fantasy and overcoming the odds. Think Goku vs. Frieza.\n\nShoujo is more like Cardcaptor Sakura, Ranma 1/2, or Sailor Moon. They're shows or comics meant for adolescent girls and young women. All of those that I mentioned were quite popular, each getting some kind of international release, though Sailor Moon is easily the heavy hitter there. \nShoujo stories are usually more character focused than shounen. Sailor Moon is just as much about the fight against Queen Beryl as it is about Usagi and the other Sailor Scouts' personal lives.""]"

"What is hilarious is most of us could have told them this in the first place and saved them literally billions of dollars.  What level of arrogance does it take to ignore what is plainly in front of your eyes in order to blindly follow a dogma?  The fact that these people couldn't figure out what any Econ 101 student would have been able to tell you, ""The customer is always right!"" is just mind boggling.  Every single studio head and every single person involved in creating any of these catastrophes should be summarily fired and never allowed to work on a similar project ever again.  I mean, I'm a woman, and I was constantly saying, ""I don't care about or even like superhero movies...""  The only time I would ever go to one is if my husband wanted to see it, and then my enjoyment is mostly coming out of spending time with him and seeing him entertained, not particularly in much of what is going on with the movie.  Occasionally these movies would, when they were doing it right, toss some little things towards demographics that weren't really into it, like a little romance sub-story in the superhero movie, or some conflict in a romance flick.  But girl bosses?  Where is the romance in that?  They're as boring to me as watching an action flick.  More so even, since there isn't even anything on the screen for me to appreciate.  There are places for both genders of actors in all films, and some films can touch equally both genders.  But trying to take a genre that is mostly enjoyed by a single gender, and warp it into something that is not at all what that gender wants to see or even is insulting to them, is simply slapping your customer in the face as soon as they walk in the door.  You get easily anticipated results.  Results any Econ 101 student should be able to predict."	[]

They are literally betting on a fictional market they think is out there. _HOW_ can these companies be this incompetent?"	[]
In business and in life, you are eventually mugged by reality and that's where we are today with entertainment. You can't keep beating your audience over the head with this stuff and expect them to keep handing money over. I've lost all interest in the super hero genre and it will take an awful lot to get me back. My kids (the target audience for this stuff) feel the same way.

"It's not thay they are trying to pander to an audience thay doesn't exist and simply calling it woke does us a disservice. In reality it's social engineering.

It doesn't  take Alex Jones to know Hollywood is on the same page as the governments, corporations and mainstream news media, pushing ""the message"". Yeah there only so long they can be this overt then they will have to go back to subtlety and subversion while they build their bank accounts back up. Barbie was the halfway mark between what woman actually want and what the system wants them to want. Which is why I think a 2rd Barbie movie will not be as successful and a 3rd will outright fail."

"I think an interesting reverse side of the coin to the downfall of the girlboss is the rise of the jokingly dubbed ""girlfailure"", especially noticeable in some of the top anime to come out the past couple years. Bocchi from Bocchi the Rock, Frieren from Sousou no Frieren, and Marcille from Dungeon Meshi are widely beloved and enjoyed female characters despite the fact that they are neurotic, weird, tend to fail more than they succeed, and have major character flaws. But they're real characters, with heart and soul put into them. People can tell and they love them, both in spite of and because they are not ""perfect"" or the best.

Sometimes, people like characters that are vulnerable, weak, and push through their bad circumstances for their goals. Especially if those characters are girls or women we can both empathize with and feel protective of."	[]

"Lego did a study when they created the Lego Friends line for girls where they discovered that when a boy plays with a toy of a character, he tries to become that character, and when a girl does the same thing, she tries to make the character become her. 
So if you give a boy a Batman toy, he's gonna want to know everything there is to know about Batman, and he'll try to think and talk like Batman when he plays with the toy.
The little girl on the other hand is going to make Batman go shopping, bake cookies and go to the prom.
That's not to say there aren't exceptions on both sides but that's the data that allowed Lego to finally get a foothold on the girls market after decades of failed attempts.

"The only addition I'd make to this excellent analysis is that the very biggest, most successful films are often those you might place naturally in the ""male"" genre - LotR, Maverick, The Avengers etc. The reason for this is whilst these films appeal to men due to their strong male characters and male-centric themes, lots and lots of women ALSO love strong male leads and male themes like action and adventure. Far more than the proportion of men who enjoy romance or musicals, for example.

So if you're going to make a blockbuster movie, if you pander to the woke and neuter your male characters, you'll not only turn off your male audience, but also the sizeable number of women who also really, really like watching Tom Cruise or Chris Hemsworth being heroic, strong male characters. Plenty of women still want a hero, even if studio creatives have decided that's now heresy."	"['‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§', ""And on top of that, those sucessful movies/stories are just quality. Whether it's a male or female lead, a good story will prevail over a weak one every time. It just so happens that the character is female in those cases. It does make a difference, youcan explore certain things and not some others in both cases, but in the end, it must be the desire to create a great piece of entertainment or litterature that drives to a commercially successful piece.\n\nBut lately we're being gaslit into thinking that female lead = success, it's not that. One of the last thing that I enjoyed a lot who happened to have a female lead was The Queen's Gambit, as the character is fascinating and you root for her as she gets better at chess while dealing with her issues. That was a great show and I wish there were more like this one. Whether the character was female or not didn't matter really."", 'Yet it somehow isn\'t an issue in anime with scores of OP characters (male or female) in the last 10 years alone.

I'm a woman who loves sci-fi and fantasy, and LOVES male characters actually being strong male characters. Maybe I don't love male-centric movies for the same reasons a male audience does - where my dad loves Lord of the Rings solely for the battle scenes (he's not much of a fiction fan), I'm in it for the strong relationships and brotherhood between the fellowship. Arwen, Galadriel, and Eowyn are all great female characters, but they are SUPPORTING characters and I would never want them to take the place of the strong leads of Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, or Gollum, just because they're women, no matter how badass they try to make them. One of my most favorite fantasy book series is Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb (who's a woman), which is also comprised mostly of a male cast (though again, the female characters it does have are all also great). The fact of the matter is, I like these male-lead stories for being the way they are."", ""Women love masculine men, and men love feminine women. It's so stupid that this is something we have to say now. \n\nAnd anyone, irrespective of gender, can be heroic by their actions. Your character doesn't have to be an arrogant, rude jerk to be considered strong.""]"
It¬¥s just a damage control. There is nothing genuine about it. But even if they were genuinely trying to correct the course they already ruined everything and the damage can¬¥t be repaired unless massive decanonizations happen.	[]
That‚Äôs what I keep saying about the WNBA. If all the women went to watch those games, they would get paid more than men. Just like my wife never wants to watch superhero movies with me. I don‚Äôt like going shopping for make up and clothes with her. And that‚Äôs completely OK. It‚Äôs just the way it is. For some reason producers in marvel don‚Äôt understand that. So they just keep losing money lol.	[]
"People probably wouldn't be so vehemently against female writers, etc if they were actually the best people for the job. Marvels etc aren't just anti male, they're also really bad in general. Even women won't see bad movies.

"You can definitely have good female characters with masculine traits (crouching tiger, 5th element, Terminator 2) But again, these will still be male dominated audiences. It's the shoe horning in of gender politics that ruins not only the characters but these films as a whole. 

It also doesn't mean every strong female lead should embody masculine strength. Great examples of strong feminine leads: Legally Blonde, X-Files, Moana etc....."	[]
Feminist both love and hate allowing women to have freedom of choice. When left to their own devices they choose feminine things, they pick what they like. Mostly. That drives someone crazy so they have to force the interest on women, force it so they don't act or behave like women. That's exactly what Hollywood tried to do.	[]

Those creators must focus on what changes are worthy for the fans only.  They must not cast their movies and shows to those who are not interested into them.  They must not flanderize characters on the level of character development based on social norms like woke agenda.

The issue is Hollywood and Disney, a former family-friendly organisation now that peddles the ideology of division, and we are better than you.  All else is inferior.  This insidious behaviour infects their hiring strategy. If you don't fit the gender, race, or role, you will be overlooked in favour of someone less talented.  That's why we get awfully written and directed films, etc.  Now, they may argue this is role reversal after years of being overlooked or passed over themselves.  BUT TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT!  You only need to look at advertisements for cars. You rarely see a male in them nowadays, so marketing and their billion dollar car companies will ignore potentially half it's audience and not to mention families to make a political statement.  Do they not want to sell their product?  Movies are just the same and are being marketed to an audience that isn't there or doesn't care.  Ultimately, people, regardless of sex, colour, or religion, just want to be entertained after a hard day's work, not preached to in an amateurish way.	[]

"Yeah, just put a ""freeze"" on any major production for the MCU or DCU for 5 years, let the movie-goers recharge their batteries, stop using secondary characters as your main characters, and then by the time 2030 rolls around, I promise you that more people will be more willing to see a superhero movie because a good amount of time has passed for the ""love/passion"" to be there again.

Stop throwing 5-6 solo movies and TV shows in the same year, we're tired of it, the characters we love are gone/dead/sex swapped/race swapped/etc. As Michael Jordan once said, ""Stop it, get some help!"" In this case, studio executives, please take the box office flops of the Marvels & Madame Web as your cue to stop this attempt of forcing all female superhero movies on super budgeted films because the audience you're trying to target won't show up and those movies proved it!

Women get the ""male"" stuff if it's well written and well shot. They did in the past. Why not to stop stoking the gender and culture wars and focus on the quality of writing and cinematography that you do so well. C'mon lad, are you afraid of something, or what?"	[]

"Somthing I never considered, if females generally don't want to watch superhero or action movies, then probably females generally wouldn't have much interest writing that kind of movie. But every writing team must have majority females otherwise it's segsizt.

This is reminding me a lot of Bill Burr breaking down the WNBA. The majority of men and woman want to watch different things. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I745Ajeq_B8	[]
The funny thing is, if you made a masculine romance/musical to cater to men, you'd probably have a good turnout. There's just more male moviegoers in general. Of course chasing the smaller female market will result in smaller returns.	[]
Your analysis is so spot on that anyone should get it.  Let's hope Hollywood eventually does.	[]
Placing women as the lead in action pictures, where they basically become men in their traits and ability to beat up far larger males, is just another social inversion the left is promoting wherein the oppressors, i.e., white males, are replaced by the victims, i.e. women and POC as they take their place at the top of the social hierarchy.  Its the equity part of DEI.  In other words, pay back time. I think most people realize there's something wrong with this agenda.  Women have many fine traits, including brains and cleverness, nurturing, and stamina.  There was a time when those traits were displayed in movies where the female lead would overcome men by outsmarting them or using their own attractiveness.  90 pound females didn't go around kicking the ass of 200 pound warriors because that only appeals to women who wish they were men or who enjoy seeing men humiliated.  You can have equality without becoming the one you want to be equal to.	[]
I dont think Hollywood earn from the box office anymore. Three years of negative income and flops shud shake Hollywood to the core but they are still moving forward with all the woke garbage in entertainment because there are no major executive getting fired and the DEI check list is now across the board, top to bottom. Hollywood wants to lose money maybe because thats what you need to clean money üòä	[]
"I believe there IS a bit of a chicken in the egg situation when it comes to appeal and preference of movie genres. My daughters are often interested in more than what girls their age would traditionally be likened to and it's nice to have options beyond various Disney Princesses and the like to expose them to, but sometimes, that's all there is - so what else are they supposed to go gravitate towards? I encourage studios to continue to take risks to broaden the appeal of their properties, but at their core they have to be well-written and well-structured stories with likeable characters, heroes and villains. The movies themselves are just bad. I didn't not like Star Trek: Discover because of Burnham's gender, I didn't like it because it was awful storytelling and execution with piss-poor payouts generated from overelaborate macguffin chasing. The pitfall I see a lot for a lot of recent unsuccessful movies and TV shows is that their effort seems to stop with ""Main Character - 'strong female'. Alright, job's done... Obviously, people will watch this for that reason alone, no need to put in any effort anywhere else"". If I can love to watch near invincible Stallone or Swasennagger mow through a bunch of bad guys, with the most basic of movie plots, but well executed structures and a likeable protagonist or settings/concepts, studios can take a premises like The Marvels and Madam Web and make them watchable and enjoyable to both men and women with just better writing and directing. It's like they looked at winning formulas from strong female leads/co-leads like 'Alien', 'Max Max: Fury Road' or even 'Edge of Tomorrow' and just decided ""the reason people like these movies so much is because of the genders involved."""

This is 100% wishful thinking. Just because someone mentioned that superhero audiences are mostly male doesn't mean anything they do will change. I think they've all known from the start what the demographics of their audiences were, and that they weren't actually appealing to them. They don't want to appeal to anyone except the rest of the woke scumbags in Hollywood, the media, academia, etc. That's their #1 priority. I know it's hard to get our heads around, but they don't care that it makes them lose money a lot of the time. They have a monopoly on the creation of movies and shows, so they know they can keep shoving their annoying messages down our throats and no one is going to replace them, much less stop them. One way or another, they will stick around. They have a lot of extremely rich and powerful people on their side who want to push identity politics at any cost.	[]
As we know from Barbie is that women will show up to films based on IPs that were geared towards girls. They will not show up for films that are based on IPs that were originally intended for boys.	[]
"Aliens is still the finest example of a fantastically well written female lead. Ripley takes the lead not because she is ""the chosen one"", or because ""she deserves it"". She rises to the occasion because she wants to survive. She's the outsider amongst the marines, and yet she talks on their level. We need more Ripleys."	[]
"It wasn't just male traits, that's grossly misrepresenting them If they were just acting like guys there wouldn't be an issue. These are 'stereotypically' negative male traits. You know the ones that generally don't apply to anyone except the person everyon things is an A-hole. If you look at it like this, Cpt. Marvel is just a less murdery homelander. But even that fails to capture the trope these characters have developed of traditional 'feminist' stereotypes (you can imagine the ones).

Plus most of these characters just lack depth. So putting it all down to ""acting like men"" is ridiculous."	[]

I'm more of a DC fan than Marvel. But I didn't see a problem with the Marvels to be honest. They didn't throw Feminism in your face they were just three women who did the job.

It's really more about the characters and the storyline... nobody was checking for She Hulk üòÜ	[]

She'd never spend her own dime on any of this though."	[]
the reason women watch action movies is because they went with a man	[]
"There's just no arguing with the fact that men and women have their own tastes in movies. The average woman is not the audience for superhero movies it's men. I think that's why for me as a man, I've never been in to female leading roles for male dominated genres. 

If we're being honest here, the only way men care for female leads is when they're sexy but also badass. For example, Bayonetta is one of my favorite game franchises because the gameplay is phenomenal. Fast, creative, and stylish. Bayo as a character has major sex appeal but is also a badass chick with awesome powers and isn't an ugly man hating girl boss. That's the kind of female character men will be interested in."	[]
How on earth did it take Hollywood setting BILLIONS of dollars on fire trying to do what nobody asked them to do and to learn what 99% of people already knew?	[]

when they're making shows that mostly guys watch, they might want to take that into consideration. they just want to ram propaganda down our throats then act surprised when we find their trash off-putting. we need to boycott these crap shows, and show em how its done. social media is a great way to plan boycotts.

Not sure if I'm off base here but... were swarms of women kicking off and demanding that these historically male focused superhero films cater to them? If so, surely they can't complain now. They got what they asked for and did not turn up. 46% of the low number of people who turned up were women meaning the majority of the audience were still men, even though it was clear that they were not the desired audience.

Part of what created this issue‚Äîand I don't mean to sound like a transphobe on any level, mind, because I'm not‚Äîis that a lot of that extremely vocal minority that called for these changes were men who transitioned into women. But, like you said, a lot of what makes up what we enjoy is in our genetics, even if we take a swing at changing hormone ratios, and while not all women like women-oriented things or vice-versa, enough do to make this point, and likewise those men who transition still enjoy all those things they did as a male, but want to see themselves represented. There's just not enough of that audience to prop up an industry, however.	[]

On the other hand they messed up She-Hulk what should've been an instant win for female led series if it wasn't for their writing and story setup. There are a ton of good opportunities out there the only problem is: is one of those idiot proof enough for hollywood to not mess it up?	[]

Even the percentage of females that do see action and superhero movies give an exaggerated sense of the interest in these properties by women, as many of them go because their husbands, sons, boyfriends, or brothers want to go see these films, and the women just accompany them to be agreeable.

The first Star Wars film I ever actually watched was Rise of Skywalker. Sure I had known plenty about Star Wars from conversations and video games but that was the first one I actually watched start to finish. I was not impressed. It had nothing to do with there being a woman on screen most of the time. The story sucked. The characters sucked. I didn't have some preconceived notion about the franchise. I didn't really know or care if or why Palpatine somehow returned so long as the story they decided to tell was good. And it wasn't.

As always, you are awesome. But this time, instead of agreeing 100% with what you said, i would change the part at 7:51 where you say they don't need to change much. Oh, yeah boy, they need to change a HUGE LOT. For me to get me back to the movie theater, or even spending a single cent again, I want to go back to basics, and eradicate this cancer from existence. I don't want to see a single fucking chick EVER leading any of OUR (male) franchises. Before this, I loved women leading anything and spent literally thousands of dollars in tickets, magazines, merchandise, VHS, Laserdiscs (yes, i being around since the 80's), DVDs, BR, etc. But now i want fucking revenge. Now i see a women in the poster is an instant skip for me, i don't give a shit. Call me whatever you want, either way, they were calling me me the Devil for the last 8 years or so anyway. So, back to normal, please, is this or nothing Hollyweirdos.	[]

"I am one of the girls who likes action flicks. I loved Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I will admit, I was at first happy when I saw female characters who got to be more than an object for the men to rescue. (Hint, if any character can be replaced with a random object that is nearly inanimate, there's a problem.) The first girl bosses kinda worked because they were unusual, and that on its own could make them a bit interesting. After a few years though, the novelty wore off and these female characters had nothing unique about  them other than their sex so there was no staying power.
There are two things Hollywood doesn't understand about us girls who enjoy action story lines. 1. We enjoy story lines with male characters. While we enjoy a well written female character, we also enjoy the same for male characters. I remember typing out a list of characters I loved and realizing many were males.  2. We also understand that because of basic biology, women are weaker than men. This means a female character SHOULD struggle more to beat a male character. Giving her an easy victory makes it harder for us to relate to her because we know we wouldn't win easily. (Think about Sarah Conner in the original Terminator. She barely beat the Terminator.) It is also worth noting that people love weaker male characters like Luke Skywalker, who lost most of the fights he entered. (The difference between Luke and the damsel in distress of old is that Luke became much more competent as time went on, while most of the older female characters who were there to be rescued never really grew.)"

"Honestly, it‚Äôs time to give up on western entertainment. Even if Hollywood managed to accidentally shit out a good film, it would still be supporting the same group of disgusting elites. 

Hollywood is fading into obscurity. With the internet giving everyone access to content from around the world, they won‚Äôt be able to compete‚Ä¶specifically with what‚Äôs coming out of Japan.

They have been releasing a steady stream of high-quality content for quite some time, and the new shows coming out just get better and better. It won‚Äôt be long before more people start switching over to anime and manga; two mediums where you can find stories devoid of messaging that still showcase fantastic narratives, classic themes, good morals, and relatable characters. 

I mean, when was the last time western media produced anything on par with Attack on Titan or Frieren?

The fact that anime has reached my demographic (30-something conservative females) is proof enough that things have changed. I don‚Äôt think Hollywood can come back from what they‚Äôve done."	[]

"3:15 - ""That's not a good or a bad thing""... Well, that's actually the whole point, there is a vocal minority of ideologues who insist that it *IS* a bad thing, that things that men like are bad, and the act of producing and consuming them makes men into oppressors. It's not like the Moneyfucks in the boardroom actually read the scripts or watch the dailies in these productions, they just farm that out to the no-talent psychophants they hire, whose personal politics have informed the content of all this dross.

And in the defense of the no-talent psychophants, it's not like the mass-produced sequels of prior eras were any better, Alien 3 was dogshit, we were treated to more crap Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th retreads than a human being could stand, and even arguably talented creators laid more than their fair share of eggs. They were still bad, they just weren't loaded with a near-fatal dose of partisan political pandering."	[]

There was a female pilot in Top Gun. She didn't have to fight for respect. She had it already.	[]
Once again, perfectly said.	[]
I was never that into Top Gun. Not the way other people were. I was a kid when it came out, I watched it on TV and thought it was awesome. But I didn't want to watch it again, once I was done with it. So, when they announced a sequel, decades later, I felt literally nothing. But a friend recommended it and said, he'd watch it again with me, so I went. Once more, I don't need to watch this film again, but I'm so glad I went a saw it on a big screen. It was awesome. But this time, that was a rarity. Awesome movies in the 1980s was kind of the standard. Now they're so rare, I'll actually venture outside of me wheelhouse for one. Because someone making a movie for the purpose of entertaining me is such a rare treat, it can't be ignored or overlooked. It's a nice feeling to watch something made by people who don't actively hate and despise me or want to destroy everything I ever cared about.	"[""I thought is was gay as hell and the new one altho a ok film was silly no one is going on such a mission it would have been done with missiles or stealth tec not old fashioned out dated jets and enemy's with silly over the top looking jets that themselves ain't even stealth it didn't make any sense"", ""\u200b\u200b@@audie-cashstack-uk4881 That wouldn't have been much of a movie if they strove for realism over spectacle, mate."", '@@audie-cashstack-uk4881Like I said, a single watch for either of them.

They\'re not selling anything, they\'re not trying to teach you anything, they\'re just saying ""here, take a seat, and watch this."" And the fact that\'s so refreshing I\'ll look upon it fondly is telling of the time in which I\'m forced to exist. IThat sequel, in an ideal world, should have been a  movie I\'d have skipped out of disinterest. But there was little better to sample. It towers over the abundant mediocrity of its surrounding competition. It shouldn\'t. It\'s a silly film. But amongst its peers, its a titan by default.']"

"the ""because males are sexist"" narrative is getting quite old.
If you present a cure to cancer and the cure doesn't do anything except placebo. And wen we say ""the cure doesn't work, it's not a cure"". Does it help the creator of said ""cure"" to say ""You must be pro cancer!!""? - No,I'm anti cancer, you just provided something that doesn't do what you think it does.
That is what Hollywood sounds like. When you shoehorn a narrative and it doesn't work. it isn't the fact that it is a ""woman lead movie"" that cause it to fail. They want to blame it on sexism because it's easier than looking inward to the terrible writing and narrative created.

Like I've said drinker, once Hollywood starts to run out of money they'll start to pay attention to these type of stats which have been known for a long, long time. People's massively stupid ideas are looked at as being creative in the last decade and look where it's gotten them. The question still remains can they weed out all of the stupid people, with stupid ideas based on no factual statistics and start to actually make movies geared towards the correct audiences again?  I'm not convinced they can. There may be so few people in Hollywood now that actually understand their audience anymore that the whole thing has to go bankrupt and new start ups just won't hire people with stupid ideas anymore. Unemployment in Hollywood will become an all time high and somehow you got to just get rid of them all.  No easy task.	[]

As a nerdy woman, I enjoyed 'Boy brands' without needing them to cater to me (Warhammer40k). I love Shounen and Seinen Anime despite those categories being aimed to male audiences.

Yeah I've heard this before and I seriously doubt it. They're not going to learn, they're going to be replaced by competition internationally. Even your audience is declining because the people who used to care about this stuff are all watching Frieren and Goblin Slayer. Also you're beginning from a position of willing to compromise, while they refuse to negotiate. They'll do what they always do, give you a token concession once or twice to hook you back in and then use that as an excuse to get even worse. Mandalorian Season 1 is a great example. The Witcher season 2 is the whole process in a microcosm, the first episode is The Witcher you want, the rest of the season is The Witcher you hate. They're self-destructive, and nothing you've said changes that.	[]

A lot of the girlboss Netflix action films draw out The Interpersonal Conflicts. Maybe that appeals to that sliver of the Venn Diagram of womynz who want to consume Male Space Representation Products, but it makes them impossible to watch for a guy.

Blade, by rumor, is also a domino in my opinion. Even though the story broke about the supposed female leads and blade being relegated to 4th lead, back in August... after Iger admitted that Disneys dive into social issues and politics hurt their bottom line, Blade script was gutted and given to another writer to start from scratch.

They tried to brainwash us, to emasculate men and empower women. They failed big time, ticket sales dropped, people realized they are sick of girlbosses and moviemakers need instead to make good movies attractive to their audience. And final note: Women hate each other and hate seing a movie where they cannot relate to a superhero girlboss, instead crave for a muscular man. See what is happening with Jack Reacher in Amazon prime.	[]

"I know several women who are also sick of the ""girl boss"" or ""bad b*tch"" stereotype as part of the female agenda being pushed in their faces. As a result, they didn't watch any of those shows.

The thing is, i really really really want to see more girlbosses... as villains. They have everything they need to fill that role beautifully.  And i think female audiences, even uptight feminist ones, will still deeply enjoy those characters in that role.  It'd be great to see the girlboss foil for the feminine heroine to compete against.

"I don't think studios are to stupid to understand what gender watches what genres. I think the issues is more fundamental issue with egalitarian values and new woke concept that gender is just social construct. So they think that more mean watch actions movies, because it was always actions movies fault being ""action""... or ""movies"", their view is that if you make them more about women, then women will watch them as much as men... and what is the better way of achieving it if not taking well established, popular and known brand and trying it out. After all if using best possible IP still fails, then the making new IP would haven chances.

What I am saying there is some logic behind it, it is dumb and wrong logic, but it is there. They thought if they make female superhero movie, then women will come to watch it and they thought the whole issue always been not natural gender preference, but imaginary social constructs which they fighting against.

I guess this is the one for future psychiatric PHD for somebody, proving that genders have inherited preferences which are not just social constructs... and even ruining every male movie franchise for decade cannot achieve women viewership in genres they NATURALLY don't like."	[]

This girlboss BS is nothing new.  Virtual signaling neutered execs have been doing this forever.

"Women are funny, man. You make a comic book movie just for them and theyre not interested. But you dont pass a billion dollars at the box office with movies like Top Gun Maverick or the Avengers End Game without a decent number of women. Women say they want their own things to enjoy but when they're given it, they're not interested. They'd clearly rather go along to things that everyone is going to see, like they're being driven by FOMO and are not tempted by exclusivity. Gyms are another example. All the insta thots complaining about ""creepy"" guys looking at them at gym could just go to all female gyms, problem solved.

I think Phoenix from Top Gun: Maverick is an excellent example of how you do a strong female character that can compete with the boys and still retain her femininity. She's a Top Gun graduate and can hold her own in the cockpit. But you're never in doubt that she is a woman. She's very pretty and it seems clear there is either history or current mutual interest between her and Rooster. There's a few jokes about the fact that she is a woman, but she takes them in stride and also makes her own jokes at the expense of the other pilots. While a supporting character, she is probably one of the new characters that will be remembered more than others.	[]

Funniest thing to me about all this is how one of the biggest movie series of the late 00s/early 2010s was Twilight, made over 3 billion dollars. Should be easily repeatable given it's cheap to make but Hollywood is so far gone from reality they can't score such an easy win.

These studios should look at the example of Bobbie Draper, from The Expanse.

And men need it specially more than women bcs in life most of time they are the ones who has to play that lead & take charge.
Like it or not, thats fact in all over the world. In jobs, security & industry men has to take charge otherwise society will stop functioning.

Weird thing is they aren't making movies for men, they are  trying to replace men from their own picture & slowly remove them completly.

Thats just plain evil.

"I think the execs know these movies are going to be flops. They don't care. Their focus is on ""social engineering"". They want to push the agenda to obscure the lines between masculine and feminine. The end result is the destruction of society. Perhaps in their minds they're striving for some distant utopian genderless society. A colorless, genderless, sexless, gray and dull homogenous borg."	[]
"One day, I hope women will realize:

-There's nothing shameful about being feminine, motherly, or sexy.

-Men aren't misogynistic brutes out to subjecate you.

-You CAN ask for help from a man.

-You CAN love a man.

-And still be bad-ass"	"[""Deal with men long enough as a woman, and you'll know why the brutes comment is incorrect""]"

"I'm very much done with Marvel and DC and probably star wars too. Going mainstream has tanked the quality of all three of these Franchises and have without killed them in my eyes.

The chances I'll come back are little to none as well, the last Marvel film I actually enjoyed was Logan.

Finally some decent content. And look, you didn't have to stirr up beef with other youtubers to do it.	[]
My 8 year old son knows superhero movies are predominantly seen by men. This is wild.	[]
The problem isn't women, it's whaaaamen! By that I mean it's a sum of all it's parts. The desperation to push the woke mind virus, the obsession with making the female characters be men but with the added density of not having any flaws that nobody can relate to, the gen z era of writing staff infecting and invading media with severe mental illness and diversity quota mindsets that don't look to do justice to either existing characters or characters they are creating from scratch to fit the story, the feminisation of men as well as the eradication of men in the shows, the misandrist agenda pushed to belittle the men in the show and those few men who look to see the movie, the fact that women are put in the most powerful positions in society and abuse their power as well as have poor leadership skills and think about the loud minority over the factual evidence of the majority and the weak simps who handed them these positions with soo much power who don't care until potential bankruptcy is around the corner because they are soo comfortable in life etc.	[]
This is a result of people in Hollywood not accepting the reality that they are business men. Not socialists or activists but people who's sole job is to make entertainment and not try to change the world.	[]
"Your argument is solid, however let me introduce you to the loud minority of the beyond stupid audience member. They can be any demographic, but there are two particular ones that stand out as having more than the rest, and these particular people scream the loudest on any internet forum they can reach>

This hypothetical-but-real person is one that has an IQ beneath not just the average, but beneath the retardation line. They are unable to understand concepts, conditionals, characters, and often they might even have trouble discerning fiction from reality, which if your 2-year old child fails to do it is grounds for alarm as it is a sure sign of the parents being related. These people are unable to identify with a movie character unless it is a tailor-made replica of themselves, sporting the same hairstyle, the same skin color, speaking in the same style and overall they can't see someone as them unless they look in a mirror. Equally, when they DO identify with a character, any flaw is seen not just as criticism, but as a straight insult and challenge that they react to with the only weapon they have, and often it is violence. These people need characters made FOR them, characters without flaw, characters without potential because they are already at some peak of perfection, characters that succeed in everything easily because they want to see themselves like that and anything else is grounds for not just sending death threats, but acting on them. You can't portray A character of a particular coloration as being dumb or many of the characters of that coloration will see the movie as an insult and start shooting up streets, you can't show a character of a particular gender as being weak or those of that gender will try and ""prove they are not weak"" often by damaging something. The good news is that unless some particular people point it out, you can stealthily insult such people as long as you do not portray one of them.

These are a solid reason why Holloywood has been like this, because such people exist, despite it being a greater mercy to take them behind a shed, because such people that see big productions WANT to be represented there else they feel like their absence is some insult or message that they will no longer exist, and you HAVE to represent them as the most put-together, mary sue characters that ever existed or they will not just scream online, but hurt people who honestly enjoy it. Years of having to cater to these short-bus passengers have irrevocably damaged movies as with such restrictions one cannot have a good story. As stated... with no flaws, there is no humanity, with no lack of strength one cannot grow stronger."	[]

They have to know that these are losing propositions. No one's out there trying to make man musicals or rom coms because they know theres no way those would make money.

It's the twitter effect. People who are perpetually online tend to be overrepresented in statistical trend analyses. Women who are perpetually online are generally more interested in traditionally male oriented genres and products.	[]
Another problem that ALL movies have is that ticket price (and concession price) increases have far exceeded income increases. When the ticket costs $20+ and a bag of popcorn $10 and a drink another $10, people aren't going to go to a theater. That's $40 per person. So to take a date to a movie its $80. That's 2-3x the median hourly wage of 90% of workers in the US. This makes audiences far more discriminating, so a movie is a twice-a-year experience not an every weekend experience, and the audience will not want to waste it's hard-earned money on crap.	[]
Wise words‚Ä¶ I raise my JD and coke to you sir..	[]
I am a woman. I've always been more into action films ever since I was a little kid. Seeing all these boss girl characters taking over for God knows how long now (too long) has been so off-putting. Even other women like me who are into their action films are so over it as well. Why ruin/change these franchises that are mainly made for male audiences? Do they realize there's plenty of us females who love these franchises as they were? We don't love it now, and who the hell are their target audience here?! Loud, ugly, screeching feminists!? I don't know any action film loving woman who likes these girl boss characters. Seriously. We don't like it. This boss girl shit needs to end. These female writers and creators need to stay away from our beloved franchises, and they need to create their own bloody shit.	[]

The real irony is that the most money (with some exceptions) is usually from the big blockbuster movies that appeal to male audiences, so they've really screwed themselves. Studios seem to be belatedly realizing they can't force audiences to spend money on the things they don't like. Hallelujah. Now get back to writing good movies that people enjoy.	[]
They should find a crew of men in the industry that are outspoken about hating this stuff and pay them to make a movie that appeals to women, to see what happens.  I'd bet money women would like it more than this.	[]
You missed out one thing. You mentioned that Rom Coms and musicals had a majority female audience. Why did they not make those films to appeal to male audiences.	[]

Don't get your hopes up. Disney fired all the people telling them what the problem was a long time ago. Now, the only thing they can hear is that if their movie fails, there must be something wrong with the audience, and they don't have a solution for that, so they'll just keep churning out more of ~~THE MESSAGE~~. I want to be wrong, believe me, but in my experience, it's better to bank on them being ignorant. It makes surprises pleasant.	[]

"I saw in another channel that in the 50's the low-budget B movie industry came to a simple and effective formula:
a) young children will watch anything older children likes to watch;
b) older children WILL NOT like to watch anything that younger ones like;
c) teen girls will watch anything teen boys like to watch;
d) teen boys WILL NOT like to watch things teen girls like.

Yeah, I know, it's the opposite the DEI teach. And that's why they are wrong."	"['Well, maybe in America girls were this stupid, I\'m not saying it\'s not true. But as a teenage girl I\'ve never been interested in ""boy"" genres to the point I even thought Toy Story is boring. The only exception was LOTR because it was such an amazing movie. My female friends were the same. But I\'m not American and was born much later than the 1950s. As I said, I totally believe American girls are (or were) stupid and have no thoughts of their own and no self-respect, only trying to imitate boys. It\'s not like that in my country though and it wasn\'t when I was a teen. I guess American girls have also changed and grown some brain since then because the formula from the 1950s disappeared for a reason.']"

"Taking inspiration from the Drinker's ""Barbie""/""Top Gun"" comparison, imagine if a traditionally female-centric genre was as focused on subverting/deconstructing tropes as our current male-centric geek franchises seem to be. Imagine if Hallmark got so tired of the mockery of the tropes in their Christmas Rom-Coms, they made one that subverted all of them. The career woman moves to the perfect Christmas town and marries the perfect Christmas man and this turns out to be a horrible mistake that destroys her life, leaving her broken and depressed. At first you might say, ""How refreshing! Those movies needed a shake-up!"" And you'd have a point. Now picture if that was every new that movie Hallmark made, to the point that the audience starts to feel like they're being shamed for enjoying the tropes that this franchise sold them in the first place. That's about where I feel like we're at with Marvel."	[]

"Male and big movie buff here. I even liked Barbie because I understood the audience and it‚Äôs clear purpose. I have a whole house of females that I could enjoy this film with and appreciate FOR them. As a result I‚Äôve even seen it several times with family and enjoyed it every time. 

Contrast that with the Marvels, which I just watched, and barely made it through once. NONE of my family wanted to watch that with me. They really did fuck that one up hard. 

It wasn‚Äôt designed for me but I still was able to enjoy Barbie for what it was going for. 

To the drinker‚Äôs point, when movies ‚Äúknow thyself‚Äù and better yet, their audience, shit seems to work out."	['The movies message was horrible but ken was the\nBest part of it.']
I hope the concept is dead, but to be honest I thought they would have woken up to this problem a long time ago. Instead, they kept pumping this shyte out time and time again. The box office failures have been much more significant of late so hopefully they'll finally see the light, but I'm still somewhat doubtful...	[]
"A problem I see, that may the reason Hollywood makes several errors before a tiny reaction, is that its difficult to correlate the feminism with the film failures, I guess.

What comes first? Bad writers and directors resulting in bad female leads and feminist movies?

Or is the terminal theme that results in bad writing and bad directing?

You see... Hollywood had been outputting CRAP in general

"I got a creative writing degree in college, and the problem was and remains to this day is that men are not interested in writing fiction...there's no money in fiction.  For everyone one of two fiction books that get published, there's probably thousands that get turned away.  However, in non-fiction there significantly better odds you can sell yourself as an essayist, a columnist, a travel writer, a reporter even, plus ghost writing is a profitable business as well.  Any good writer in college is immediately steered to writing non-fiction so they can make money and hopefully donate it back to the school.

Women don't want to write non-fiction, however as I said before it's really freakin hard to make a profitable book, so they end up getting independent television and movie writing roles.  So naturally you are getting more women in writing rooms and very little to zero men, you don't have ideas to bounce off of to check to see if they work, so they just write what they think is good and it's not good.

Shouldn't have an all men room....can't be having an all women room either."	[]
Badass female characters can definitely work for action and science fiction movies when done properly. Just look at Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor. They are kick ass heroines that don't take shit from anybody and can carry the story, but they are also characters that people can empathize with and relate to and that is what makes them work.	[]

"It is possible to hit both male and female demographics...if you do it accidentally. Take the strange case of ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic,"" a show aimed squarely at selling pretty pony toys to little girls helmed by a female creator that inadvertently attracted an adult male fanbase. The main character was definitely female, but that wasn't the main focus of the story. Instead, it was about her being a socially awkward nerd, navigating the pitfalls of interacting with others, while having adventures in a fantasy universe. While the show certainly wasn't perfect, I think modern franchises looking for crossover appeal could take a few lessons from what this show did accidentally. For one thing, the two-parter ""To Where and Back Again"" did a secret invasion story better than Disney+'s ""Secret Invasion."""	[]

"They really should have taken notes when Elizabeth Banks made that terrible Charlie's Angels movie and said that it ""isn't for men"".

This is literally the stupidest thing you can do as a business. They don't factor in that a shit ton of men actually pay the movie tickets for women either. 
It's the same thing with female sports. WOMEN DON'T FUCKING CARE OR SUPPORT IT, more men actually watch it than women. Obviously male sports will generate more revenue which in turn means WAY more pay for male athletes but people are too dense for critical thinking and love to blame men and our so very rampant sexism üò¢

When you look at all the issues with woke-ness you may tend to think that one of their problems is that they're terrible writers. But you would be only partially correct. They are universally incompetent so they're terrible at everything. Writing is merely somewhere on that list. They can't be good writers the same way they can't be good CEOs or Governors or...

The heart of the issue is that the woke movement which is based on social constructionism, believes that gender is a mere social construct and therefore holds no inherent differences, ignoring the entire fields of evolutionary biology and genetics. Therefore, instead of realizing males and females like different genres due to many factors including androgen and genetics, they simply think if females are socially conditioned enough, they would flock to superhero movies, this is no different to someone testing the law of gravity by meeting the pavement with their face from 10 floors up.

I knew Madame Web was going to suck AND Sony did too since it was released on Valentine‚Äôs Day, then released on military base theaters the same weekend.

Joker on Better Bachelor made a brilliant point. When we were kids, and playing with our GI Joes, or whatever, we aspired to be them, or like them. When girls got hold of the same toys, we would find them having tea parties or going on dates with their dolls. Males tend to emulate and identify with their entertainment, and women tend to take the same item and shove it awkwardly into their world. I never considered that view, but hes dead right.	[]

"My girlfriend is a huge Marvel fan, always talks about ""Spider-Man"", ""Iron man"", ""Captain America"". She's never once said ""I need a movie about female empowerment"".

In Barbie's defense from my understanding both her and Ken learned and grew their self identity, even if that was not the intention. Just like you said. They tried to make Ken the bad guy but ended up making him the most likable character.  Ken learned he didn't need to simp for Barbie.	"['I agree. I think an argument can be made that Ken was the main character in that film. They gave him the best lines and an actual story arc. At the end it was like the filmmakers said ""O crap, what do we do with Barbie"" and then she became real? What? If anything Barbie needs a sequel to see how it went after entering the real world. Maybe she\'s a depressed wino with cats all over her. That\'d be great.', '@@nickporter574 I can see that.  She is all lost without Ken and sees the errors of her ways..LOL  Who are we kidding?

I must disagree with you, oh wise and learned Drinker.  You greatly underestimate the current corporate climate and structure.  The executives at the studios will double down on blaming the audience and keep churning out girl boss DEItrus down our throats.  To admit their error would be to acknowledge responsibility, which in turn would cost them and their acolytes their jobs, bonuses and stock options.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  Iger and Kennedy have built an entire media model around girl boss/DEI/white men who act like men are evil.  Until the current crop of executives are replaced/retired/removed, expect more of the same, albeit at a slower pace.  For example, Snow Not So While and the 7 vertically challenged individuals are not cancelled, merely delayed to they can workshop, reshoot and try to make something less...I don't know, less f*cked up?

Making movies for women audiences in genres that aren‚Äôt largely associated with them like superhero movies isn‚Äôt even the problem. In fact it could be a great thing. The problem is in the implementation. If you drilled down based on the results of the graph you showed in this video and were able to understand the specific aspects of movies or shows that make different demographics more attracted to them, and used that to inform your product, then you could stray from the known formula and have high quality women led superhero films that will not immediately, but eventually draw in that desired fanbase.

You'd have THOUGHT that it wouldn't take this long. The WNBA should've proven that taking something that had a lot of male support and swapping it to women doesn't automatically mean $$ from women, and that's now been around well over 25 years.

Take Reacher, The women on that show are bad asses. They are still feminine, and make mistakes and have to overcome issues. They never have to Emasculate Reacher to show how strong and capable they are. They also have to fight differently given their non superhuman parameters.  Granted, most women can not fight like them, but they have to use things to gain the advantage instead of being able to throw a man halfway across the room with no effort at all. No one wants a character with no development or flaws or obstacles to overcome. It is not that hard of a concept.	[]

I guess if studios want to pursue a DEI agenda, then good for them. There are plenty of amazing movies and TV series out there with diverse casting that you don't even think about because everyone fits organically with the story... The issue here is that they tried to apply corporate DEI theory to audiences, who unlike prospective employees are not lining up to get in the door. For audiences, engaging with the brand is their choice rather than their livelihood, and audiences are quite rightly choosing to reject product that's not made for them	[]

The studios fail to account for the overall sourness and malaise of the average, white, male age 30-60.  We're talking about people who live on Joe Rogan,  Pat Mcafee,  Infowars, low quality narcotics, and pornography that centers on degrading and humiliating women. So obviously these people will never show up for any movie that isn't in their immediate interests. Maybe...a reboot of Hostel or something?  Or  honestly, for the most part, any movie at all since these men are usually broke. Hence the studio not spending a lot of time or energy tailoring movies to their interests.	[]

It‚Äôs not that men cannot accept women lead characters.  We just want GOOD women lead characters!  There is no better example than Ellen Ripley, from Aliens and Aliens 2.  I was a male teenager when Aliens 2 came out, and I thought she was the most believably  badass character I had ever seen on screen.  She didn‚Äôt show the men up because she was a woman.  She didn‚Äôt and did not attempt to show anyone up.  She was only trying to survive.  She was legitimately very smart, she was second in command in the original Aliens, she was experienced, she knew what she was up against, she was mature, and she appreciated the danger of the Aliens.  More importantly, she actually had a realistic character arc.  She was genuinely afraid of these things, she had to control her fear, she had learn how to defeat them.  Nothing was easy and she barely made it out alive.  And because you believed in the character, you rooted for the character.  Yep.  Ellen Ripley was a female character virtually any teenage boy would pay to watch on screen.	[]

Totally agree re: girlboss films just don't cut the mustard. Away with them! Then, let's do away with the overblown CGI & return to practical stunt work; one of the reasons Tom Cruise & Keanu Reeves movies are so much fun is that they actually do most of their own stunts, and the CGI is toned way down. Let the cutting begin!	"[""As Drinker says, there is ONE good and successful action movie like that. The issue is not that a movie centred on a cardboard-cutout girl boss has to be bad, just that there are far too many being made - it is a very tired trope. And yeah, CGI is way, way overused these days too. Just once I'd like to see a movie that avoids the dreaded green screen.""]"

Alright the ideas at about 6:00 sound kind of fun in the right hands, the former as a comedy, and the latter as a mature character study. I think the problem lies not with the fact that the industries are attempting to cater to the ‚Äúwrong audience‚Äù, but that they are just oblivious to the concept of a good story. A good story is not necessarily one that stays in line with a specific genre with a specific audience in mind (though many are) but is just a competently written work of fiction.	"[""I agree with this. I think it's definitely possible to craft good stories which break with conventional genre/age/sex trends, it's just more challenging. It would take more effort, more competence, and more finesse, than is being put into 'the modern movie'. To maximise profit, studios ought to assign most of their writers to working with tried and tested tools on products they know people want, while challenging their best writers to create novel, rule-breaking stories, that are higher in risk, but stand out from the crowd - and are actually good.""]"
4:51 NO! that's where you're wrong. This isn't about chasing an audience, it's about propaganda! This really went to the extreme after Hillary Clinton lost the election.

"This is an honest question because I generally agree with this video‚Äôs hypothesis but why was Buffy so popular? 

Buffy is a super-girl-boss, Xander is a male bimbo, her mentor Wesley isn‚Äôt much better - by the end Willow is super powerful along with characters like Faith. 

The other obvious example is Ripley, she is totally more bad ass than most of the other marines, tho it‚Äôs her character of strength rather than her physical strength that is her real superpower. 

Do a video on those two characters and why they are so good and why people (guys included) like them so much?"	[]

Slightly off-topic, I don't know how TGM got a green light.  It had not one, not 2, but 3 competent White men in charge of women and minorities.  It had not one but 2 women who were strong, smart, capable, and said nothing at all about the patriarchy or being held down.  It had not one, not 2, but 3 ethnic minorities who were subordinates to strong White men but never made their race an issue.  And despite having women and minorities it had a climactic finale featuring strong White men only.  TGM gave me hope that sanity still exists in Hollywood boardrooms.	[]

"Hollywood doesn't understand what makes a strong female character. At least the activists in the writers' room don't.
My favorite of all time for strong, female character. Mrs. Brisby from the Secret of Nimh. Yes, a cartoon mouse is my favorite all strong, female character. Her character and actions can be lifted from the fantastic setting and applied to other stories. Just for the record, Ripley from Alien and Aliens is a close second. Hell, they share a lot of the same characteristics. They both face a dangerous horror. For Ripley, it's an alien. For Mrs Brisby, it's a tractor. The tractor is an overwhelming force for the tiny field mouse and shrew. Anyone who says they're not afraid of farm equipment has never seen someone mauled by farm equipment.

But here's the problem for Hollywood. A married woman with children is not self empowered in their eyes. But a story about a woman fighting for the lives of her children is inspirational to anyone with a soul."	[]

"So have Hollywood decided to look at the criticism we've all been saying for years now? 
It's not necessarily the casting or story's for films and TV the last few years that's bad, it's the writing and directing that's been bad.
Are they going to finally stop calling us racists and bigots when we ask them to stop changing cannon in our long standing fandoms and write good stories that compliment what's come before?
Will they stop getting defensive and treating us like idiots when we ask that they don't race and gender swap legacy characters? And instead just write new characters in new ideas for IP's and make them believable.
And the big ask, will they stop shoving identity politics into every piece of fiction? And realize we want to be entertained not lectured at."	[]

Using modern Disney logic rom-coms should be marketed toward men, be written by men, directed by men and have all male casts. What could possibly go wrong lol.	[]
"I largely agree with the points you made in this video. One major point I disagree with is ""there has not been nor will there ever be a big female audience for superhero movies."" Your supporting arguments are strong. I agree that making girlboss movies where unrelatable female characters kick butt with no consequences while their male character counterparts solely exist to be the butt of jokes is not appealing to any audience--male or female. But to go as far as to say that we should never try to appeal to a female audience/give up changing the demographics of audiences that watch superhero movies is taking it too far. I believe that there is a world where incredible female-lead superhero movies can be a huge hit among male and female audiences. They just need to make movies that have characters that audiences can relate to/want to root for. 

There have been very crappy male-lead superhero movies. We don't say that we should not make anymore male-lead superhero movies just because those crappy movies exist. Instead, we point out the flaws that made those movies crappy and encourage better movies to be made. The same concept applies for female-lead superhero movies."	"['This comment deserves more likes', ""I agree. What we need is plausible human beings displayed on film. This is why Wonder Woman succeeded whilst Cpt. Marvel didn't. Wonder Woman had some highs and lows as a film but generally speaking Gal Gadot's character was plausibly presented and plausibly written. Only let down by a weak resolution and ending.""]"
I think it‚Äôs too late. If you had told me after I walked out of Avengers: Endgame that Disney would totally scuttle the entire MCU in the span of about four or five years, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed you. But what‚Äôs the point in returning to these movies? Even if they restore the original focus on elements that appeal to a male audience, that formula is stale. People won‚Äôt come back. Genres don‚Äôt last forever. Not a lot of Westerns these days. We‚Äôre about to see the entire Hollywood Studio system upended by personalized AI content anyway.	[]
I doubt even studio execs have much say these days due to DEI/ESG scores. They clearly don‚Äôt care about the money and it‚Äôs about spreading the agenda & forcing behavioural changes in the populace over time.	[]
"I actually disagree with some points here. I think they were actually starting to woo women with the early Marvel movies. How did they do it? Was it with all the empowered women? Nope. 

I knew SO MANY women who were OBSESSED with the sexy male lineup of the original MCU. I actually heard girls raving avout MCU more than boys in my teen social circle, often arguing about who was the hottest of the lineup. Making the male heroes more sexy and personable was actually seemingly reeling in more women to watch, while maintaining guys as well. Then they replaced all the guys with stoney faced, perfect power fantasy girls and the women and men tuned out. 

I don't think you'll ever reel women into hardcore sci-fi or extremely complex super hero universes, but you could easily score a larger female audience while maintaining male audiences by making men sexy, manly, and dangerous again. I mean the amount of fan girling over the MCU was ridiculous. They had their female audience and male audience, but decided to pretend women don't want to see attractive charismatic men anymore. 

If there had been a real Black Widow movie that was done as a grounded spy thriller and featured some past male spy who was attractive and dangerous having a back and forth cat and mouse game I guarantee they could've reeled in loads of women and men. 

MCU was successfully appealing to women in the past by casting a lot of actors that women found extremely attractive. If casting Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. strange wasn't a move to attract women I don't know what is. It was actually the first time I ever saw women starting to get excited for super hero stuff, and then they tossed it all away. Even Barbie was smart enough to put Ryan Gosling in it."	[]

And just because one project decided to switch gears for one series doesn't mean other future projects will be willing to follow suit. Hollywood is all about naval gazing. They'll look at the failure that is Madame Webb, then go ""well, shit, at least it didn't happen to my project,"" then go right back to making girl boss movies like nothing happened.

This isn't a victory for film. Just the calm before the storm. Watch, they'll go right back to making shit girl boss movies in a few months like Madame Webb broke the box office, because acknowledging the audience collectively will mean they're at fault, and if that was the case, that would mean every garbage project they've made in the past decade was garbage, and it can't be their fault."

"Sometimes movies are supposed to make us uncomfortable. Barbie was designed for a female audience sure. But It was also designed to make men uncomfortable with the status quo.

It's not fighting and dominating 260 pound weight lifting MMA men with super strength. I agree that they need to use the gifts they have to solve a problem, but more importantly, they need to make the audience care about them as characters. They need a backstory, they need challenges to overcome, not by kicking ass, but by using their gifts in a realistic way. They don't need to insult every man in the film, additionally, every man in the film doesn't need to be portrayed as a bumbling fool that needs saving from an overly masculated female character. Oh shit, I'm rambling... 
Really all we need is a bit of sanity injected into the plot."	[]
They're not stupid, they always knew these movies would flop. The interesting question is: why did they make them anyway?	[]
"Target Audiences:  hmm, force feed women super hero movies. But I don‚Äôt see the reverse mentality. Where are the Romcoms catering to men right now?  Definitely a Hollywood market they should explore!

Man is tired of dating 304s that only want material goods and money. Starts dating in small towns to find one of those wholesome girls who was raised right and in the end gets married.  That‚Äôs an absolute tear jerker for men knowing it‚Äôs a complete fantasy.  Maybe that‚Äôs why they can‚Äôt write it."	[]

If they think that women are going to start to love super hero movies en mass they are as delusional as people who want litter boxes in schools because they identify as cats.  heres the sad truth, Comics, SUPER HERO comics, are male power fantasies.  Have been since Superman graced that cover in what the  late 1930's?  Niche women and fake geek girls will always hang around because they are actually into it or just followed their significant other to it,  but most women aren't into science fiction, superhero or action movies and just because a poll on facebook said 50% of the audience that liked comic books were women doesnt mean human nature changed.  And Black people arent going to automatically  care about your MEDIEVAL FANTASY SHOW because you made the elves black.....	[]

The sad thing is once all of this madness has eventually stopped, we will all move on and in 20 years when looking back there will be a huge black hole in cinema history where almost everything was utter shite. If we do that now and look back at all the movies that came out say, between 1995 and 2005 there are some absolute materpieces. We won't be able to do that in 20-30 years time, becuase most of these film are shite now, they aren't going to look better when filming technology and CGI are 20 years more advanced. It's a shame, but at least it cost the people responsible billions and billions.	[]

I just cannot express how much I hate how they flub these movies and shows.

Because it was hateful and it came out in the writing. Buffy's episode on abusive fathers was genuinely frightful... Shehulk's episode on male victims, made fun of male victims.	[]

I'm a 25 year old male and movies like Mulan and Tarzan still entertain me and make me long for a time when we had feminine female and masculine male characters.	[]

The male audience being 70% of superhero movies is not entirely correct.  It's deeper than that.  You have to remember that at MINIMUM, 50% of those women went to those movies ...because of a boyfriend, husband or son.

Before iron man most super hero movies were unsuccessful. It took studios about 30 years to figure out action and super hero movies. It looks like they thought if we change a couple of things we can grow our audience in this new demographic. Which led to a budget misalignment for some movies. Also audiences were expecting movie Type A when they got Movie type B so were disappointed because expectations were not met. I think female super hero movies can be successful but it requires appropriate budgets audience expectations to expand so they understand they are getting type B or type A and film makers figuring out how to make Type B work.	[]
All female girl bosses cast is not targeted at regular women. Normal women enjoy seeing manly men or nice women or men on screen. Talking just about female audience,  for these is mainly angry women who dislike men or women who like women, so quite limited to begin with, that's why the female % and number is so low. The rest of the regular women had no problem flocking to movies like Aquaman or Barbie.	[]
"The problem isn't that male audiences don't like female leads. The problem is that male audiences don't like these bland, disinterested, disrespectful, disengaged, mean-spirited attempts at writing characters that happen to be female. And guess what, female audiences don't like that crap either.

The gender of the main character(s) matters little to me, it's why I didn't cry foul when GTA V had three male leads, or when RWBY had four female ones. It's all about whether or not the characters are portrayed as realistic, likeable, engaged, genuine, and not pointlessly 'at war' with the other sex.

And this applies to villainous characters as well. Characters who are realistically evil, likeable due to sheer charisma, engaged in what they're doing, and genuine in their ideals are SO much better than copy-pasted straw men (and it's usually men) that only exist to be torn down by a more diverse 'protagonist'."

"Had the Hollywood writing community thought ahead, and carefully planned a slow burning conversion, audiences would have gone along with ""the message."" The masses are stupid and they would have been bamboozled if the program started slow and casually introduced folks to girl power and girl bosses. Ultimately, they could have slowly acclimated audiences to transworld, also. Instead, the writers and guild tried a full frontal, head-on assault of traditional values and expectations, and, as is the case whenever force is applied, they encountered resistance. 

It proves their total incompetence."	[]

the problem theyre having here is the same problem the wnba has. women by and large are not fans of the product. the wnba fails because women dont watch it because they arent fans of it. it might be sexist of me to say but women by and large love romance and steamy movies thats why 50 shades of grey did so well because it appealed to alot of women. making an all female superhero team aimed at a female audience is not going to succeed because the audience just isnt there. it would be the equivalent of making an all romance all male movie aimed specifically at a male audience it wouldnt succeed because the audience isnt there.

You‚Äôd be stupid if you said double down on steak‚Ä¶

I think one of their biggest problems is that they think women can only relate to women, or men to men, or white people to white people, black people to black people, etc etc. Movies are at their best when they are relatable to everyone, no matter who they are. I'm a white woman, but I could still sympathize with Denzel Washington in his movies, though he's a black male. They want to create factions and divide us all into categories. The devil knows a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that's how he's been bringing down once-great countries like the UK and America.	[]

The idea that people with money on the line are just that stupid doesn't make sense.  Yes, people can be stupid when it's other peoples' money.  But you'll find that when it's their money, they're actually pretty clever.  Plus you have dozens of youtubers and others constantly explaining the truth.  No way this is a simple misunderstanding.

I knew that my sex wasn't and  isn't,  all that interested in what I loved, and I'd rarely mention my comic book collection to any fellow girls back in Grammar school.  When I met my future husband, we immediately shared our love of reading & favorite authors and we had nearly twin libraries. He could bear more radical, rough violence, and profanity than I could, but that is the only BIG difference in our choices. There were my favorites and he had his favorites, but we also,  had a lot in common. Oh, and I always was a Superman and Batman fan while he liked Marvel movies. 
 Modern girlboss superhero movies don't appeal to me. I love the male of the species and a traditional sexual reality where men ARE men and women ARE women. If this insane generation wants to claim differently, OK,but don't try to make me believe the impossible. I will not be ruled by children and the propaganda of a culture gone stark raving insane. NO Drag is not art and cut-and paste body parts doesn't mean you change anything intrinsically Male or Female. Male up, fancy clothes and high heels don't mean a man can become a woman.

These progressive woke wonks want to make movies for an audience that never requested, or are too small to justify them. Period.
The Marvel Universe was financed by generations of males that grew up reading the comics and were amazed that someone at last took their interests seriously.
Now we got a bunch of DIE radicals trying to push a bunch of woke progressive BS on us that we have no interest in, and then are complaining that since the female and .05 percenters they made them for are not buying tickets, WE, the generational male fans are to blame for their failures.
The F'n nerve.
We DID NOT ask for this.
Women did not ask for this, or if they did, did not support it. Did they?
And the .05 percent...can you do the math?
If Disney wants the Marvel Universe to succeed again, recognize your core audience, and quit trying to subjugate us with you continuing double downing of things the market has shown simply are not working.
It is very simple that even a room full of corporate woke simps should figure it out. Or am I giving you too much credit?
Let's start with: Stop! STOP! For f'n sake, stop F'n around with Deadpool 3 and let Reynolds make the movie he know will make you the blockbuster movie you're craving.
You want to keep on losing, just keep up what you're doing and soon Disney will be a fond memory of a company that for generations brought great joy to sooo many people, young and old...until you didn't."	[]

"... ""The problem with Hollywood""...

WAY back in 1998 Warren Beatty made a fun movie called Bullworth that sums up amazingly well the current state then - and now - of Hollywood - see if you don't agree.

The movie is about a U. S. Senator from California - played by Warren Beatty, who has had a ""Come to Jesus"" moment, so to speak, and is telling the truth without holding anything back (for the first time in his 30-year political life).

The story-line gets a little uneven and odd at times but, let's face it, there are few ""perfect"" movies - and the truly funny, insightful good moments in this one outweigh the minor bad ones.

In any event, Warren Beatty plays the Senator and delivers the following line in the scene at the big Hollywood fundraiser, where he is speaking to ...""all the rich Jews"",

""The problem with Hollywood, the problem with you guys is that, well, you just make crap."""	[]
I want to make a romantic musical about how much women suck and tell them in the press that this was not made for them and I don't want their business.	[]
I'd like to think Hollywood would learn the lessons and draw the conclusions you listed toward the end, but I fear they will just swing the pendulum the other way, and not have any women leads in their products.  No more Ripley's, Sarah Connors, Kara Thrace's, and a bunch of male characters just as badly drawn as the current girl bosses.  I fear current Hollywood simply doesn't have (enough) truly creative people left, as they all got fired over the past decade.	[]

There is also the global trend where the world may or may not have a war - wars a fought by societies with traditional values, so there you go: the studious that have been pushing fanatical extremist propaganda regardless of the losses are changing the tune and returning to something traditional right when traditional is needed. What a coincidence. We may even have a Donald Trump victory, as the press isn't really hiding that this is a likely possibility - and the press didn't do this in 2020.	[]
"I'll post what I posted on another video here: ""The elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about are the biological differences between the two sexes. We can deny it till we're blue in the face - while men and women are equal legally and socially, we're NOT the same biologically and psychologically. Men overwhelmingly gravitate towards portrayals of violence while women overwhelmingly gravitate towards portrayals of love and romance. All the modern attempts to reverse, deconstruct and remake this phenomenon will NOT change millions of years of evolution. The only way to change this is to recode the programming in our genes. This is why the writers and publishers of romance novels are so successful, they know EXACTLY what women want and they dutifully stick to the formula - boy meets girl, boy loses girl on page 56, and by page 180 the book ends with a marriage proposal. You can call it old-fashioned, sexistic, homophobic and all the other modern tropes - evolutionary biology doesn't give a damn. Fact is, this is what is hard-wired into women's DNA and so therefore this is what women respond to. See exhibit A - the very strong sales figures for romance novels, no matter how ridiculous or contrived the plotline. You can't FORCE women to like violent superhero stories. Sure, there'll always be that sizable crowd that likes violent video games and go see all the violent movies, etc., but they represent the clear minority and not the majority of women. Men, especially testosterone filled YOUNG men, are the main purveyors and consumers of violence - you create violent superhero films and market them to women at your own financial risk!"""	[]
3:18 notice how men aren't even remotely interested in the things that women like? Whereas all the things that men enjoy women can also kind of get into. This isn't because women have broader tastes than men, this is because 'male' entertainment has been diluted to cater to women. It's rare that you'll see male entertainment which doesn't try to lure in women, either by catering to their egos or by introducing a romantic subplot. Whereas, romances don't even bother to try to lure in men. Not that I'm complaining about that last bit, but please stay the f*** away from our entertainment.	[]

"Something I find interesting is the rise in popularity of so-called ""Girl failures"" as a popular character archetype. It's like the opposite of a girl boss. I feel like the name is a weird self conscious name choice that girls have chosen for the character archetype because they feel guilty for liking and relating to characters that aren't omni competent masculine badasses. They don't understand that watching a character that isn't perfect grow is what entertainment used to do. What is Luke Skywalker at the start of Star Wars but a ""Boy Failure""? He gets his ass kicked multiple times and has to be saved. He is whiney. He is often in over his head. We watch him grow."	[]

This ideological artistic vision they have won't be changed it will only collapse the entire industry,  forcing it to be rebuilt from scratch over decades.

"""(...) that you can't make every movie appeal to every person (...)"". You can, Barbie did that. They did a movie for woman that appeal to woman, check.

"True heroes and leaders only keep denegration as a tool in their back pocket to use sparingly against evil and fools who stand against them. Otherwise, they rise above through competence and unshaking devotion to righteous principles, and inspire others to do the same.

"They really want that female audience. Women are much more agreeable and their standards of a good film are wildly different as a general matter. They know if they can get women to watch in bulk, they can get away with lazy storytelling, gimmicks, constant swaps whether it be racial or sexual partner swaps that permeate entertainment created for women. They can hire cheaper writers, producers and worse actors and get away with it. They can load it with political propaganda because women tend to be less sensitive to it. Its been the CW's business model for a long time now. 
  They want to make cheaper movies the lazy way and get the biggest demographic. Barbie did very well not just because it tricked people but because women tend to scrutinize less as long as the people are pretty, women are shown in a good light and sexual themes are more polygamous. 
  Its not going to work with super hero films but thats why they are ecstatic to kill them off."	[]

I liked Rey and I had high hopes for her but the way she was handled was terrible a complete Mary Sue	[]
I think they have ruined female heroes, because they have painted themselves into a corner. They can‚Äôt make the girlboss human again, because this would humiliate women overall. The easiest way around this is not to have female heroes for a while until the audience has forgotten about it. They have to sit quietly in the corner until the paint is dry and then quickly fix the rest.	[]

"I don't think this is very accurate. The thing that all of these flops have in common is that the writing is terrible. It has very little to do with the ""girl boss"". Great example would be the latest season of True Detective.

It has nothing to do with the actors and everything to do with the quality of the writing."	[]

"I certainly agree, man-hating girlbosses are most certainly not appealing on their own.
I myself have numerous anthropomorphic OCs that I've created over the years - most were male to start with, so I started including females to balance it up a bit. For the most part, they're all confident ladies who can hold down a full-time job by themselves and a lot of them even paired off with some of the established males... but in a way that they complement and complete one other.
When it comes to action, a devoted battle-couple who stand equally works so much better than having a girlboss and her grovelling male lackey. I mean, take Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann."	[]
The entertainment industry has lost it's ability to entertain. They don't have that skill anymore. What's substituted is formulaic and contrived. The added politics are a Red Herring to further obfuscate the fact that no matter how much money you spend on talent, CGI and marketing - the result is mediocre at best. I think the future is production companies that manage to work outside the current mainstream system and depend solely on results. We need new, different actors, producers, screenwriters.	[]

"I don't have a problem with wokism and inclusion, but I have really had it with those lazily written heroines. I mean seriously, if you had a flawless male hero who constantly succeed for no clear reason, nobody would enjoy that either. I'm always reminded of the ""capable man"" trope in 1940s era scifi.
That got old really quick 80 years ago and nobody tried it again with success. That ""capable woman"" isn't popular with anyone is about as surprising as ""capable man"" not being a success with anyone over the age of 10 back then."	[]
The same thing will happen to the acolyte.	[]
Haven't paid to see a Disney movie since spider man no way home and that's not going to change.	[]
"I'll watch a ""girlboss"" movie.  Female leads aren't the problem.   Older movies and TV shows with strong female lead characters exist.   But modern female characters, especially the super hero ones, succeed due to contrived, unimaginative plot twists.  They gain powers or skills through little to no effort.  Star trek did the same thing with Discovery and Michael Burnham...she had every skill set imaginable, she didn't need and often didn't want the help of other characters and even when she did the wrong thing for a right reason, she received praise and rewards.  The problem isn't the gender, it's putting the characters on an unrealistic pedestal."	[]
Its not hard to put women in a male target movie and have them do well. Emily blunt in Edge of tomorrow for example. That movie never once made it about gender but she was still a badass strong female character. Their problem comes when they obviously try to belittle men or make them seem inconsequential to the female characters instead of having them work together.	[]

"It's kind of funny that Tomb Raider is somewhat back in the limelight now while Hollywood still scrambles to figure out how to make a female character that isn't box office poison.

An iconic character from back in the ye'ol days of the OG Playstation. With a sexy, confident, mature bri'ish lady who goes on crazy adventures for artifacts and the like. Back when sex-appeal for a character wasn't something to censor and cry about, but actively advertise.

Really, it seems like it'd be the easiest thing to make a good Indiana Jones movie, but with more of a focus on guns than whips, then throw in an actress that can actually do her job. Granted, they can't even make a good Indiana Jones movie to start with...

Can't even remaster the games without having a trigger warning before them too..."	[]

They want to make movies to appeal to an audience that just doesnt care about that material. Just make it cater to men. Sure in theory making movies that cater to women makes sense. But in general women dont like action movies. You can make a female lead and not have it be shit to bogged down by whatever the fuck they think they're attempting to do. Women can be strong characters without the writing trying to hammer it home that they are	[]

The reason women marvel fans don‚Äôt show up for female led/directed/acting movies is because they all focus on ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù and not much else. Give us an actual story with complex characters, witty dialogue, interesting storylines and some sort of moral dilemma and we‚Äôll show up in droves! That‚Äôs why Ironman, Spider-Man, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and the others were so good. They never sacrificed the plot to insert random representation or pander to specific groups. You don‚Äôt go to the movies because you want a lesson in current political trends. You go for the story.	[]

"Drinker once again speaking cold, hard facts with white hot fury! And I think you acknowledged there's room for protagonists of all sexes and colors, if they're written and portrayed well and not audience-intelligence-insulting. 
But you missed something about power-fantasy girl-bosses in superhero movies: they got it from the comic books first! I don't know how good or bad those are doing in sales now since crow-barred-in political messaging quit being subtext and just plain text. Like the characters don't speak like characters with their own multi-dimensional personalities, but as mouthpieces for the writers (ex: the parts from Jason Aaron's run on ""THOR"" they used for the 4th movie, most of the recent Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel arcs), so until the comics they use as source material changes their tune, the movie and TV adaptations may not.

Also, I watched BARBIE with my brother and his fianc√©, less than a week after OPPENHEIMER. I thought we were all going to crack jokes through it, MST3K-style, but it was only me. I'm far from the target audience for that movie, but part of an unintended one: the ""ironic"" one.
EDIT: And yes, I know The X-Men always fought against bigotry, discrimination, and hate (ironic then that their own published pretty much segregated them from the rest of their universe to the margins), but they were never ""woke"", but progressive. Slight difference."	[]

With films dripping with politics (where the story is a vehicle) and reshoots that garble a clear identity (and add tens of millions of dollars to the budget), the question of ""how does this appeal"" seems to be convoluted. A lot of these things should have never gotten beyond a pitch. With John Wick films, there\'s an easy pitch (Keanu Reeves kills everyone).  But spending 300 million on the Marvels? The pitch would have had to include ""it has Brie Larson in it and costs 300 million dollars"".']"

The greatest female TV character of all time is Dana Scully from The X-Files. She was tough, incredibly intelligent, driven and a great role model. She saved the day just as much, if not more than her male co-star and respected and was respected by her male peers. Scully encountered real challenges and adversity and through her merits she overcame them. Scully's vulnerability demonstrated her bravery. Her character flaws were enhanced her strengths and gave her opportunities to grow. Scully inspired countless real girls who watched the show to explore careers in medicine and law enforcement. Even as a boy, I looked up to her and wanted to be just like Scully when I grew up. The first rule of storytelling is show, don't tell. Marvel will spend billions of dollars TELLING you that women are strong, intelligent and capable, but a relatively low budget TV show from 30 years ago did an infinitely better job SHOWING you that women are strong, independent and capable.	[]
"Another important point is that females are more trend-chasing than males. If a girl's older sister liked something, or worse yet, their mother, then the girl will be negatively biased against it. Because new = young and youth is a woman's currency. The Force Awakens was a big hit because ""nerd"" culture was trendy at the time, but then the franchise fell off a cliff as it gradually became old hat. And the girls that watched Force Awakens have no loyalty to the brand the way males would."	[]
Women can be interested in superhero stuff if it taps into their sensibilities. Sailor Moon is the prime example.

"As a woman who prefers sci-fi and superheroes over romance, I'm in the 30%, but that's OK üòâ But, I will also say, as a woman, that I agree. These aren't the films I want to see. The characters are boring at best, obnoxious at worst. I don't care if characters are male/female, or 'strong', I care if they're interesting. The only 2 films I've paid to see in recent years were Dune, and Oppenheimer, both excellent. 

I will offer an example, as a contrast, of a good female lead (at least from my female perspective): Katniss Everdeen (and maybe it helps that she comes from books, not directly from Hollywood). Yes, there's a strong core to her character, but mostly she's just fighting for survival, and the survival of her sister (her core motivation). She's terrified, and (realistically) has massive PTSD. She doesn't magically become awesome at everything, she's often on the edge of failure, and absolutely needs the support of the people around her. She's a complex character, with many flaws, a complex back story, and clear, strong motivations. And ultimately the Hunger Games trilogy is an ensemble, she's surrounded by other complex and interesting characters. THAT'S how you do it."	[]

"Most of all in these women lead movies I'm surprised how self-deprecating they are. Almost all of them have some really negative women stereotypes, that are getting highlighted, like they are proud of them. For example, in Marvels 3 main heroines can't work together about multiple worlds saving plan because one of them is sad ""because you didn't visit me after the Snap"". 3 professional super heroes can't do their job, because they are too emotional - if it was said by a man, he would've been torchered, but it's OK if the movie shows us. After a while they get over it and go with lots of hugging and girly noises, again showing some teenage like behavior, that makes it harder to take them seriously. I just don't get it. It's like if the Avengers had all those macho men stereotypes - like high-fiving each other every 5 minutes or drinking beer after each mission.

I think there's an important point being missed here - the point of shoehorning girlboss female leads into the superhero genre is not actually to make money by attracting a female audience or to push woke ideology, it's a behind-the-scenes Pentagon-led effort to boost military recruiting of females. The inherent message of the superhero genre is 'you should become a hero through righteous violence' with the unspoken corollary being 'enlist in the military.' And the services are desperately scrambling to recruit more females. Hollywood depends on DOD cooperation to make these movies and the amount of control the Pentagon has over scripts now is alarming. As long as this continues, the badass girlboss characters will probably keep coming, even if it loses them money, because they think that if they do it, girls will want to join the USAF when they grow up just like Captain Marvel.

I don't believe in pure pandering. There's no reason why a movie targeted to women can't also attract men, and vice versa. As a man, I did not enjoy BARBIE much, but I did identify with Ken, and ultimately felt empowered by his story arc. The main message of BARBIE is that it's dangerous to keep an entire group of people in perpetual oppression, because then they will revolt and seize power, and be too ignorant to know how to exercise that power. The Barbies learn that the Kens needed to be fully incorporated into their society, or else Barbieland would be subject to an endless cycle of coups d'etat. But, in a way, it was ironic that conservatives were so offended by BARBIE, because the movie's ideology was itself conservative: proceed slowly with civil rights reform, educating minorities before you allow them to take the reins of power. To be sure, conservatives will insist they don't believe in that and insist on strict meritocracy, but gradual empowerment is what they indeed believed in back in the past.	[]

"As a child in the 1970s, I loved the Disney princess movies (some more than others), Mighty Mouse was my favorite TV cartoon. It was love at first sight when my parents took us to Star Wars Episode 4. My sister and I would catch reruns of Star Trek: TOS when we could find it. 

Later, I watched Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. 

My favorite Disney movie is the animated Beauty and the Beast. I've watched the Fifth Element at least 100 times. I enjoyed both the Adventures of Hercules and Xena, but enjoy Xena more because the character development seems deeper and more complex.

 But I also watch A&E's 1995 Pride and Prejudice at least once per year, although, I generally dislike romance movies and rom coms . 

Suffice to say, I've watched my share of content that features strong women. I've also watched my share of content that wouldn't fit the image of women currently pushed by Hollywood. 

But the mere presence of ""girl boss power"" isn't why I watch.  

Give me a compelling story with characters that seem like humans. 

Who struggle and work with other characters. 

One of my favorite genres is mystery series. I'll watch any series in that genre regardless of the sex, race, identity of the sleuth as long as the stories are logical and the characters are interesting.

If I worked at Trek, I would restore the prime timeline, and take the story forward properly. A cool new flagship. A new crew. With cameos from the past.

I like Bill Burr‚Äôs take whilst discussing female sport. The female audience have a much greater interest in things like the Kardashians. That is where the big audiences of women are. Not all, of course, but the majority. It is not men‚Äôs responsibility to watch films they don‚Äôt want to or are not interested in. Where are the women? Currently attending a Taylor Swift concert. Why? That‚Äôs what appeals, and that is fine and Taylor, the Kardashians become multi millionaires, richer than many male entertainers (is that an unfair pay gap?????).	[]

I literally won't even stream Dial of Destiny, let alone go to the theater or buy the 4K. I refuse to give money to a studio who kills the legacy of arguably my favorite film character by inserting a hamfisted girl boss.

It's the same story with women's sport. They would like a competition that gets the same attention, is lucrative for investors, and pays the female professional athletes the same as men. That's fine, so long as you can get the male sports fans to double the amount of money they spend attending a second team each season. The logical alternative might be asking women to support them in equal measure, but to do that you'd need to drag them away from their spending habits on core interests like physical appearance, brunches, yoga, pilates, theatre, and expensive dinners and boozy evenings with besties. Once you solve that, then you will FINALLY be able to celebrate the arrival of men-version 2, and the profit machine can finally get back to doing what it loves. This damned inconvenient people making their own choices and ignoring investor needs of perpetual growth!	[]

"I think the issue isn't of ""men and women have different tastes."" I also don't think that the idea of taking male action-hero tropes and applying them to female characters isn't an issue. The issue is that all these strong female protagonists tend to lack any degree of fun, lack any interesting character flaws and always prevail. To me, their at their worse when they're basically just ""female Steven Segal"".

Wonder Woman (2017) is a fine example of doing it right: she's powerful and extremely capable but is interesting, fun to watch and has character flaws to show she's not infallible. Sure, the ending was a tad dumb, but I can overlook it as the majority of the movie works."	[]

"What can we expect? Nothing.
Propagandists do not care about profit margins. The goal was not so much to appeal to a new audiences (women) but rather to take away the modern masculine mythos from men.
In the liberal utopia, boys cannot grow up looking up to traditionally masculine ideals, and men may occupy two vocations: a meek sexless worker drone or a male model boytoy. (Trans agenda serves the same purpose - it creates literal castrated male worker drones).\

Hollywood will, for appearances, act mildly inconvenienced by bad box office takes. However, due to massive amounts of backchanneled fiat currency, the propagandists will never go bust.

"I read a quote from an unnamed Disney exec the other day that said ""More and more, our audience (or the segment of the audience that has been politicized) equates the perceived messaging in a film as a quality issue. They won‚Äôt say they find female empowerment distasteful in The Marvels or Star Wars, but they will say they don‚Äôt like those movies because they are ‚Äòbad.‚Äô So ‚Äòmake better movies‚Äô becomes code for ‚Äòmake movies that conform to regressive gender stereotypes or put men front and center in the narrative.‚Äô Which is what you‚Äôre seeing now."" Source: Puck News via Darkhorizons. 
In other words, it's STILL the fault of evil bigots (ie. everyday regular people who just want to be entertained) that none of Hollywood's lazily written attempts to crowbar female empowerment into male brands isn't working. The wonderful and virtuous writing teams aren't to blame, it's the bigoted audience who simply hate women and speak in code. Definitely not because these movies are dismally written, cynical, social-trend-of-the-month chasing, browbeating, pandering, deliberately combative and divisive. No, it's the fault of ""politicized"" audiences. No mention of the fact that Disney were the ones politicizing them, of course."	[]

"a less capable male isn't a problem if he can still do something when he needs to help his partner and his partner isn'[t constantly putting him down and treating him as inferior for his gender. points at nier automata or fate stay night. you have strong female characters with weaker male counter parts. but weaker doesn't mean useless and it doesn't mean the girls hate them. and that's why i think the 'girl boss' fails. because she treats her male counterpart like garbage and acts all high and mighty about her position.

A good chunk of the remaining 30-40-ish percent of female watches of Comic-based super hero movies are watching because a guy has stated a preference and they're going along with it. They'll enjoy the movie, if it's a good movie, but it's not what they'd have chosen if they were going out with their girlfriends. Watching movies is a social activitity and both men and women will occasionaly dip their toes into something thats 'not for them' for the sake of their partner. Men will occasionaly watch drama or romance. Women will occasionally watch action, sci-fi, and fantasy. Sure, there will be men and women who really do like the genres that the opposite gender likes more, and in a world of 8 billion people, you can even find an absolute huge number of them, but relative to the general population, they are less, and if you're trying to make products for a mass audience, you have to take that into account, or end up ultimatly failing.

One also need to understand why the women that DO loyally follow genres such as fantasy & sci-fi & action & other typical male genres is because these women have found the appeal of said genres just as men do. And if there is anything in typical male genres that does appeal to the minor but just as loyal female audience it is very often the male characters! A woman myself I grew up with SW, Indiana Jones, Rambo, Alien, Terminator, Back to the Future & much more. Of course I loved Princess Leia, Ripley & Sarah Connor, & later on even became a large Lara Croft fan. But my true desire was Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Rambo, Kyle Reese, & later on Jack Sparrow, Aragorn, Maximus, Nathan Algren etc etc. What woke Hollywood refuses to understand is that the vast majority of women on this planet happens to be hetero & hetero women love to see attractive male actors doing awesome stuff, no matter if they are heroes or villains, in whatever fav stories they put to film. There is an old classic saying about the James Bond fandom; the male audience fantasize about being Bond himself. The female audience dreams about having sex with Bond. That explains it all really. Clark Gable had a very dedicated female fan base back in his days! So have Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Richard Burton. Who were screaming the highest at Beatles & Elvis concerts? Face it, Hollywood; women LOVE men! Actual men that we have no problem relating to even if our genders are opposite. Sorry, KK, but you are a moron for claiming that women are literary unable to identify with male characters, such as Han & Luke for example. No, woman, YOU have that problem! You do not speak for me or for the female half of this planet with your, honestly, very sexist opinions targeting women as much as men. Women actually love male characters that have meaning to the story they are in, even if the role itself might be tiny. Most men are genetically programmed by Mother Nature to find the hottest chick, or chicks, he can find so he can have the greatest sex with her & spawn as much as possible. Women look for the strongest & most protective man, preferably good looking but not a demand, so she can feel safe & race her kids in harmony & safety. This is how we are & function genetically as well as emotionally. With exceptions, of course, that should never be ignored or disrespected. But if you wanna tell stories as a way to make a living, stop going against Mother Nature. Stop undoing what we have known about each other & story telling since the camp fires back in the stone age. The ancient Greeks invented drama & theater because they understood the importance of story telling to strengthen your culture, people & nation. Stories unify - if told right. What fandoms have felt unified this past decade? As long as they make stories that forbids women to enjoy & love men no one will be united.	[]

"Me and my wife just watched the marvels on Disney+. I'm not a great marvel fan so I couldn't follow the context of the story. I didn't know who most characters were and it made me feel excluded. 
The film was a silly comedy for children, unlike the earlier marvel movies saw back when Iron man and Thor were still in them. They were funny at times but made for adults. This one was not.

The cats were a cute idea. But it was all very silly.

So if a gay female couple who didn't see all hundred previous marvel movies aren't part of the target audience then I'm not sure how they expected to make any money on this.

"You can make a ""guy movie"" appeal to more women by adding some of the things that appeal to female audiences. They have been doing this for a long time, but didn't cram it down your throat.

"It‚Äôs almost as if Marvel at this point is purposely trying to sabotage itself. You had ten great years of movies that built up to an epic climax but since then it‚Äôs as if Marvel is trying to 180 it self and undo its own success. It‚Äôs been five years since Endgame and there have been very few noteworthy titles under the Marvel name to garner any positive attention from the fans. And it has to be on purpose. You don‚Äôt take a franchise brand like Marvel and fuck it up on accident like this to the point everyone is wanting their money back for a MARVEL movie. Even pre-MCU movies didn‚Äôt have this kind of backlash, I mean the Fabtastic Four movies from the 2000s aren‚Äôt generally loved but they do have their fans and I‚Äôve yet to hear anyone regret paying to see them. 

The big question is what is the endgame in all this? Turn back the clock years ago and nobody would have questioned who was better between Marvel and DC as far as longevity but in the last few years we continue to see this spiral of failure from a once revered name in the business and you have to wonder what the hell they are smoking to fuck things up this badly."

"First, you are correct. Second, let's be honest about the world. The writers for Hollywood come from the liberal arts schools that are extremely political now. It is embarrassing that phrases such as ""know your audience"", ""Create believable characters"", and ""Your protagonist is only as good as your antagonist"" have been forgotten. These are things we were literally taught in high school English or in English 111 in college. Call it ""The Message"", ""Going Woke"" or whatever, at the end of the day it is the death of common sense that has killed Hollywood. Great stories and storytelling have been around as long as the history of mankind, or humankind for you sensitive types. The fact that Hollywood can't seem to tell original, compelling stories says a LOT about our university and ""ivy league"" college system. Honestly, the studios would probably have better luck with writers from the local community college."	[]

"This is actually the first time that I've understood the dynamic - a failed attempt to expand the base of superhero movies. Funnily enough this is a strategy that did work for Lego, they created new lines such as ""Lego Friends"" specifically targeted at girls and did succeed in diversifying their base, so that is what Disney, Marvel etc tried to. Actually fair enough, it's just that it didn't work, either an intrinsic incompatibility or a series of failed attempts."	[]
"Hollywood, the souless bank accounts, nor the 'creative' writing staff comprehend that what people want to see is all the values and traits that they admire or share with a protagonist. Nobody likes the bland and boring Mary Sue the same way nobody likes Gary Stus either, it isn't the gender it's the relatability. The reason nobody connects with Rey is because she's automatically good at everything and succeeds on the first or second try each time, she's just naturally gifted but in -everything- she attempts. You could have made it a male character and everyone would have been just as annoying.

Pepperidge Farm remembers when Jake Lloyd got bullied off the web and ostracized by the whole Star Wars fandom for playing a character that was annoyingly talented, naturally good at everything, and had to put in zero effort. What's worse was that it fit Anakin's character perfectly, just like it fits all these talentless ESG/DEI hires. They've had everything handed to them, have to work for nothing, and then get upset when the real world knocks them off the pedestal that some corporation or ideology put them on. Really, it isn't their fault. They're born, raised, educated and employed in a perfect little bubble, so of course when that protective layer is gone they see the world as hostile and hateful. The people victimized by this cycle don't deserve any of the hate, and from what I've seen they don't get much unless they try and defend that position.

See the difference between Daisy Ridley and Rachel Zegler. One took the criticism in stride and acted like a professional, the other took up the shield of 'diversity' and 'change' and used it to avoid any and all criticisms about their work. Hatred for the art is not the same as hatred for the artist, and until the system stops trying to remain an echo chamber it will only get worse."	[]

"To follow Marvel/disney/woke logic one has to assume guys only like to see movies with guys in them and dudettes only see movies with women in them.
I do not think world works like that. I e.g. do not think Alita Battle Angels main viewers were women because sex divide comes more about genre than characters. E.g. it's generally harder to get women to watch horror movies. While there are some women who like horror, but vast majority usually says no thanks when you suggest movie night with that kind of movies."	[]

The important thing to note about Barbie was it was a bit of a phenomenon.

Why, as a woman, would I want to sit through a movie with nothing but a bunch of women trying to be like men?  It would be a lot more entertaining, for me, to watch men doing this stuff--that is, if I were into the super-hero film genre, which I'm not.	[]

Hell one of my favorite characters ever is Vasquez in Aliens 2. A badass marine that didn't ask for special privileges and could hold her own with the men. They built her character out so her weakness was her friends and brothers in arms. They gave her a realistic human weakness and emotion just one and that's all we needed to morn her death. A believable one too. It made sense she'd be hardened to everything but the one thing females cannot escape... their natural nurturing instincts when it comes to people they truly love.

Write some characters like that again and maybe I'll come back to the movies. Until then you lost this superhero, action film, syfy, horror loving woman. I'd rather watch reruns forever than the pathetic winches they're producing today. 

It's not good to root for your lead hero to die or completely forget what the names of the supporting heroes are before the end of the movie. AND WHY DO WOMEN NEED SO MANY SUPPORTING HEROES!!! Geezus when done right it takes ONE. Ugh lol"	[]

I think it goes further than trying to get a female audience. I think they wanted to influence culture and make women more like men and men more like women. The left has been trying to destroy the concept of gender differences for years. And it has been working in some ways. Women are now on the front lines of the infantry.	[]

"I find it humorous that the people who push this eye-rolling garbage write movies where males are devalued, ridiculed, even outright denigrated just for being male, as if their mere existence opens them up to obviously deserved distrust and hostility, then those same people whine when men don't go watch the movies/shows they produce.  Imagine creating a movie in which women were portrayed as stupid, feckless, helpless, tools for male enjoyment, then whining when women didn't line up to make the movie a smash hit.  I heard it this projection and entitlement perfectly summarized by another critic recently: ""imagine being an adult film maker who suddenly decides to only produce male gay porn, then blaming the audience for not watching your new stuff by calling them homophobic, as if it's THEIR fault you're new films are bombing."""	[]
As you‚Äôve said, the problem is marketing to ‚Äúa female audience‚Äù. If a film appears to be doing that, the story is very likely to be ‚Äúabout being female‚Äù. YAWN. How about catering to a ‚Äúsuperhero fan‚Äù audience?	[]

"The problem is that ""badass girl bosses"" are more appealing to a very specific group then actual heroic female characters, mainly because they don't understand what it means to be heroic, and much less what it means to perform heroic acts (and the personal costs such acts may carry for the hero or heroine who might accept such costs initially or learn to accept them as part of the responsibility they carry as superheroes and superheroines over time). That is why they go ""wow"" when they see a female character punching holes in a spaceship, but doesn't give a rat's ass that the character is ACTUALLY committing mass murder as a result, because to them the optics means more than the meaning or outcome of the act. To them, being ""badass"" means more than ACTUALLY doing good in the world of the superheroes and superheroines (and being the role models they so desperately want them to be), in whatever form that may take according to their individual or personal contributions or skill sets of such a character. 

To deny them their ""due praise"" as girl bosses, is to deny those group their ""fullest potential"" and as a result of that, they believe a rejection of such characters are a rejection of their ""fullest potential"" as women (who can in their eyes do EVERYTHING better than men can, which is part of the problem which leads to such female characters keep on failing). An interesting lack of self awareness (or perhaps even a deliberate avoidance of the more obvious reason) of WHY those characters aren't accepted, which I can illustrate with a much earlier Marvel character and scenario. In the first Thor movie, we see a boisterous, arrogant and childish Thor living the high life, and who has to be HUMBLED to reach his fullest potential as a hero by ditching everything that was sabotaging him on his journey in becoming a worthy champion of Asgard - in essence, becoming WORTHY of his mantle as a hero (as framed by being able to lift his hammer again), which is why Captain America at first struggles doing so, but once he embraces the selflessness and sacrifice that going all out in helping those that need it, he is able to lift the hammer as well. Vision could lift the hammer right after being ""born"", because it was in his nature (as part Jarvis, but also part Ultron - illustrating his capacity to be either good OR evil, and choosing to be good OVER evil) to already serve those that needed help because of his unique abilities that allowed him to better understand everyone and use those insights to help them. The lifting of Thor's hammer isn't some ""PRIZE"" to be taken, it's a measure by which a hero or heroine can judge their OWN motivations for their actions and thoughts, and gives us, the audience, a look into WHEN a hero or heroine has TRULY reached that threshold of fully accepting their role as a protector and guardian of Earth (and the bigger universe as a hole). That is why letting EVERYONE just lift it for no reason at all proves absolutely nothing and is a huge let down, because we KNOW some of the other characters haven't gone through the fires of temptation or suffered as a result of being a superhero or superheroine, and gained no wisdom from such experiences that shape and form them into the heroes or heroines that one could root for and which would making the lifting of the hammer meaningful in any way.  

A more interesting angle I'd like to point out is the following. They never show the female characters being part of the ""brainstorming of solutions"" or helping the male characters constructing anything (something that really stood out in the DC ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" animated movie of 2024, when an emergency facilitated an ""all-hands onboard"" effort by dozens of characters trying to stop a multiverse ending event (which BTW also highlighted the ACTUAL diversity of characters over the decades as well, I might add - with zero gender or race swaps necessary). As the Flash's dying wife told him, ""you were late for all OUR appointments, but you were always on time when it mattered"" (or something to that effect) - the kind of understanding of heroic characters by a storyteller who TOTALLY gets it.  

So the ""death of the girl bosses""? Doubtful. They had them to a lesser degree BEFORE I was born several decades ago, and they will KEEP ON pushing them until they are accepted (even if only by a fraction of a small audience, and even in ways you don't even realize in your favorite characters or franchises). And I'm also pretty sure once those characters are accepted, they will make them even MORE unlikeable then they already are, and those characters will CONTINUE to be ""promoted"" in every franchise imaginable with cries of ""go queen, slay"" for YEARS to come, because their supporters and defenders are EVERYWHERE in current day, even when that's not even the majority of the audience."	[]
In my opinion women are fairly drawn to masculine spaces and culture so long as there are at least a few crumbs for them like a romance subplot or a female character that reasonably facilitates projection.  There is no need whatsoever to go ham with full replacement of male characters and lefty girl power messaging in male franchises to get a ton of women in with their boyfriends.  Meanwhile you‚Äôre just not going to get men to go see the likes of Barbie or Lesbians Riding Bicycles.  So in the end the highest potential is going to be male focused media as Hollywood once understood.	[]
Ellen Ripley was never a lead. She was just the last crew member lucky enough to survive and to somehow make it against the odds, panicking from scene to scene. It's not a pseudo-superior girl boss soaked with delusional arrogance. The focus is on her survival and not on showing off nonexistent superiority. She survives at last because of the sacrifice and risk taking of the other crew members, granting her the opportunity to learn and adapt. It's believable and plausible, that's why it works.	[]

I think there‚Äôs a lesson to be learned from the latest season of True Detective.  On the surface you could be mistaken for thinking it might be another woke remake of an old franchise, but it mostly works.  The characters are flawed, have complex backstories, feel real and there‚Äôs unexpected twists.  It doesn‚Äôt feel like a gender studies lecture, it‚Äôs just an engaging mystery story.	[]
This analysis has a flaw:  It assumes that the people running the studios and creating these products WANT to make money.  The more likely explanation is that they are trying to push The Message at all costs, and if the studio succeeds, fine, but if it doesn't, that's also fine, it's just one more capitalist raciss patriarchal institution that they think should die anyway.  If they bring down American entertainment institutions, then that is just more damage to the American economy and deletion of the primary means of getting the American way of life out to the world.  Tails they win, heads they win.	[]
You know why? Because the media keeps protecting them and gives them excuses why they fail, and not allow them to take responsibility for their failures.

Saying these movies are made for women seems like an insult to women because it's basically saying women enjoy bad movies like these or are too stupid to like good movies so we should make bad movies for them.

"The other problem is that these writers and producers need to stop with this patronizing assumption that when writing these scripts that they need to write for the audience like the audience are just a bunch of idiots.

"Honestly, they'll need to do more than that for me to go back to the cinema.

So why would I part with my money to watch anything they make? 

Take Deadpool and Wolverine. Even if it isn't a steaming pile of woke lecturing, I'm not giving Disney a penny, because I'd prefer to watch them go out of business.

It is more useful and helpful for society to understand itself though given examples of challenges each part of society is going through(Blue Eye Samurai is a perfect example). 

The idea behind what these superhero movies are trying to do makes sense, but the execution is terrible, to say the least, because the people responsible for making this content have zero emotional nor artistic understanding."	[]
A friend of mine is a far-lefty woman, someone who appears to be the target audience the Woke Marvel is going for -- she LOVES the original Marvel movies -- She couldn't watch more than one episode of She-Hulk & Ms. Marvel, didn't bother with other new Marvel shows, and thought The Marvels stunk.   They don't even know the people they think they are targeting.	[]

The worst part is that we already knew all of this. Women are not the target audience when it comes to superheroes and action. Even though all superheroes are women. It's like making a guay romantic musical... with superheroes thinking that men will rush to the cinema because we put superheroes in it. Really? We have to spell it out? Everything that is woke and exaggeratedly feminist is fundamentally negative. Send negative vibes out into the universe and don't expect positive vibes back.  But apparently, they had to spend millions of dollars to find out. What does that say about Hollywood and its ‚Äúleaders‚Äù?	[]

5:58 The nice thing about Phoenix in Maverick is that she didn't do any of that. She wasn't a STRONG FEMALE CHARACTER, she was a strong character who happened to be female, surrounded by other strong characters. She contributed about the same as any other member of the team. She was similar to Vasquez in Aliens: capable and badass, but not outshining all the male characters and not having them outshine her. They got it just right. If Disney had made the movie, though, then I bet she'd have been able to fly circles around everyone else, including her straight white male teacher.	[]

I liked the first season of Human Target back in the day, but hated the female-led second season. I grew up watching LoTR, and I hope they never touch it.
It's not that hard to understand (unless you're a SJW apparently that doesn't live in the real world): men and women are equally valuable but have different strengths and weaknesses, different ways of seeing things, and different ways of getting things done. It's just facts, and no amount of threats or tantrums will change it. They've only succeeded in alienating their existing male audience and ticking off what female audience there was, and now everyone's unhappy. Good job. üòè

As a woman who love super heroes, fantasy, and sci-fi I have to say that my opinions tend to be on the side of the male viewership in those genres anyway. I love romance and musicals, but when I sit down and watch a Marvel or Star Wars movie I'm not so dumb that I expect the same beats from them as I would from a movie geared towards women. I miss the strong male leads. They're a draw for women, too. Especially straight ones.... ü§£	[]

"I can't get this thought out of my head about how badly modern Hollywood has screwed all this up. Great female action heroes aren't some great mystery that's yet to be figured out, we had this shit right as far back as '77 - Princess Leia is a first rate action hero, and I will die on that hill. In a few more years we also got gems like Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor... and the thought I can't get out of my head is this: Modern Hollywood writers would have had Sarah go through with killing Miles Dyson. They probably view her stopping herself in that moment as some kind of weakness or flaw that modern girlbosses just aren't allowed to have... even if that's what makes the characters human and relatable.
Also, modern writers probably wouldn't even have Arnold in T2 at all, because Sarah ""don't need no man""... or some crap. Also, John might not be in it, either, because we want our girls to grow up to aspire to things other than motherhood or love... So, no motherhood, no love stories... so that's Terminator and Terminator 2 out the window... also Aliens, since that gives Ripley strong themes of motherhood with Newt. But, y'know, those movies are obviously massive flops and forgotten pieces of crap that no on ever talks about, or ever speaks of as possibly the best sci-fi films ever made, or action films ever made, full stop. Oh... Wait..."	"['even as far back as Maria from *Metropolis (1927).*  She may not have been an ""action hero"", but she was the one to convince the rich and the poor to shake hands and amend their fears/hates of each other, which led to the almost total destruction of their society as manipulated by technology posing as a hedonistic human.  Hmm.. if only that message pertained to modern society in some way...', 'Perfectly stated! I have watched all of the movies you mentioned recently because I wanted to be reminded of how well movies can be made.', 'I have been saying this, arguing this very point of yours online since about 2005. Applied it to Doctor Who, Trek, Star Wars, Terminator and so on. I used to write for Den of Geek a fan site. And in the end I stopped writing articles for them. Why? The constant uphill battle to get the people to see that stuff like Ghostbusters 2016 was a bad idea, for the exact reasons you mention above. I got so sick of trying to get my point across, to just be shouted down as a racist a misogynist, a bigot or for being too critical. I got tired of being told I was wrong about Rey, about Captain Marvel and everything inbetween.  So I stopped writing for them, I stopped creative writing and more or less gave up. There was little point as no one would listen. And then we had last year and its flopbusters. And I started to see the tide was turning. At last. I dont for one second think Hollywood will learn its lesson. I think that certain studios will go bust trying to prove this point, and things like Star Wars will never change back to the good they were. BUT the general audience has had enough. They are rejecting it and so that at least gives me some hope. And some satisfaction looking at websites like Den of Geek and Filmstories uk, all struggling and having to accept that they were wrong....']"

I happen to be a girl who loves action movies- John Wick over Barbie any day. I understand I might be in a minority but what I can't stand is other women...grown women passive aggressively letting you know you are in the minority.

Write a great story, film it with a unique vision- I think that is what has been lost.	[]

"How to spot a raging misogynist: The devil is always in the details.  A surefire sign of a threatened, insecure man who carries in his heart a burning hatred against women, is in the language he uses.  If his language is tinged with violence and an air of mortal threat, that's a surefire sign of a woman hater.  For instance, let's say he puts out an internet video, with a title along the lines of ""Death of the girl boss"" He could have just as easily titled it ""End of the girl boss"" or ""Society rejects the girl boss"" But that's not where his head truly is.  The reality is that deep down, he's profoundly threatened by the prospect of equality.  He doesn't believe women or any other group that threatens him deserves anything beyond a role of total subservience.  Therefore, any perceived threat will be viewed through a lens of extreme devaluation and eradication.  Remember, after actions, words are the second most important method by which a person's character is measured.  So when someone tells you who they are, believe them."	['üòÇüòÇüòÇ']

"You know what? I'm actually going to disagree with you. You CAN cater to both audiences and your idea for Top Gun Marverchick could have actually worked. What you described is literally TOO GOOD for Hollywood. The PROBLEM isn't just that they're taking stuff that appeals to women and shoving them into male brands, it's the fact that as they do that they try and make the male brands aggressively anti-men! The Hollywood version of your Top Gun Maverchick would have starred the woman, and she would have acted like a guy except even more of a jerk, and every man would have been an incompetent irredeemable monster. I bring this up because there are many projects out there that understand the concept of a Periphery Demographic...but that's the key word: PERIPHERY. You always have one MAIN demographic that you cater to mostly, and then a secondary demographic you throw some bones to.

Anime understood this a lot. Much of the magical girl genre is aimed at little girls but still throws in some stuff to appeal to a male fanbase like leaning into darker plots at times, making the girls a smidge more attractive and not just cute, and recently punching up the fights a bit. This stemmed a lot from how Cutey Honey went down back in the 70s: a female led manga which featured wall to wall tiddies yet inexplicably appealed to girl got made into an anime aimed at girls that easily appealed to boys with its action scenes and more risque moments.

For something closer to home? My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. You think that show INTENDED to be a smash hit with 30 year old men?! No. But it did because they tried to make the show tolerable for parents and eventually threw their new unexpected fandom plenty of bones with some unexpected deeper lore moments. Though really I liked it because it was better at being a modern Looney Tunes than the actual Looney Tunes show. Dropping a piano on a wheelchair bound Twilight Sparkle is, in fact, the moment I fell in love with the show.

So you absolutely COULD make a show/movie that appeals to both men AND women BUT it requires you to:
1) Not hate half your audience
2) Acknowledge that Men and Women are different

So...basically impossible for modern Hollywood."	[]

We still have critical thinkers capable of seeing through the lies and the  bullshit. Wait till those start to die out in future generations. Then the fun begins.

The stats that show more men go to superhero and action movies will just make the studios double down on making more girl boss movies, because they are trying to change that trend.	[]
"My thing is the point of ‚Äúa woman doesn‚Äôt primarily want to see guns and action scenes they‚Äôd rather something like Barbie‚Äù isn‚Äôt inherently correct. While yes the themes of Barbie spoke to me ‚Äî as a woman ‚Äî I‚Äôm not entirely a lover of those types of movies. I prefer the deeply cerebral, violent, and pay-off type movies that men mostly get advertised to. 

An example of a show specifically catered to women but falls in line with a lot of what I said is The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale. It unnerves you, it makes you think, it can be deeply violent, and has a main character that is believable and extremely well written. I‚Äôve never seen anything in media portray actual female rage and suffering as well as that show. 

Another example is Alien: the main character isn‚Äôt written with the idea of feminine aspects in mind, but she‚Äôs extremely believable to me. As a woman I relate to her, and the way she‚Äôs badass without screaming ‚ÄúGIRL POWER‚Äù at the damn xenomorph makes her one of the few women in media I adore. Ellen is a great example of how not thinking about gender and just creating a character works! Alien is consumable by every gender and I‚Äôve never seen anyone complain about Ellen being a woman. 

My point is just make a show, a book, a movie, or whatever and stop thinking about how you have to cater to someone or the character has to be overly masculine or feminine. Write a damn character and give them a gender afterwards unless you specifically want to make a point about it. 

I‚Äôm tired of seeing people miss the point of getting the female audiences attention. It isn‚Äôt hard you just won‚Äôt make a character that doesn‚Äôt talk about her FEMALE PROBLEMS every two damn seconds. I‚Äôm not saying women don‚Äôt discuss it, but they sure as hell don‚Äôt do it every waking moment. My entire life isn‚Äôt devoted to proving I‚Äôm more capable than the men or whatnot, even if that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve legitimately went through. People have an idea on how you should be, and by acknowledging it and moving on that‚Äôs more girl power than any of these movies understand. Being able to withstand the comments, the mental strain, and the inadequacy you feel everywhere you go is the female experience, but it can also be relatable to MEN!!! We might feel inadequacy in different ways, but it still stems from our social circles. Don‚Äôt put the other gender down in media. Lift, appreciate, and create solely for the concept of creativity itself."	[]

"They always try to repurpose these male Brands because feminism is still believe that there's no difference between men and women. They believe that traditional feminine traits are weak when they are not.
It's like the writers go into the writing room with the following philosophy:
Men are bad and Society was created by men therefore Society is bad. Yet women are good no matter what status they have in life. Unless they act like women have traditionally acted then they're bad. They can only act like men but remember men are bad. Even when men start acting like women to counteract the women acting like men. They are still sneered at but women are supposed to be perfect so why are they sneering?
If you think that this is confusing then what kind of story do you expect to get from the writers who have this philosophy while writing"	[]

Easiest way to make women watch genres they don't usually do is to simply add hot men in them and have them act in hot guy roles (or bad boy roles). Majority of audience for Netflix Dahmer was women, Hunger Games wasn't watched because of feminist protagonist but because it had teenage boy idols in skintight spandex suits. Women watched Pirates of the Caribbean films too only because of Jack Sparrow and for no other reason. Girlboss characters alone are not driving people away from these movies, but the fact every male character around them is a whining and useless weakling, so ironically theres nothing for women to watch either.

"The reason that Ellen Ripley was such a great character, was that she was written by men.  Juxtapose that with these ""modern"" female characters written by women and the difference is staggering.  All powerful, all knowing, all better, all condescending, all smirking and all ultimately unlikeable."	[]
Now Hollywood and Marvel realized that listening to a loud but small minority isn't really a good idea	[]
I'm a comic book fan from the early 1970s. I feel like if you kept watching comic book movies in theaters after that Civil War movie mess you were also asking to have your eyeballs pulled out, individually, and have the sockets washed out with All Tempa-Cheer and scalding hot water. üëÄ	[]
"First: you‚Äôre the ‚Äúshite‚Äù when it comes to commentary and reviews‚ÄîI‚Äôm ashamed that it‚Äôs taken so long for me to tell you.

Also, I think there is a possibility for both women and men to enjoy different genres: it‚Äôs been done before and I think it can be done again. The secret sauce is, as you reference, in the types of stories being told, and the characters, therein. There‚Äôs a Barbie movie that I could support, but it would have to tell a story that I‚Äôm interested in, and  include characters that didn‚Äôt tell me that I sucked, simply because I‚Äôm male. I‚Äôm not sure the genre matters as much as the aforementioned elements. It turns out‚Äîand studies demonstrate‚Äîthat men and women respond to similar types of female characters."	[]
I think a more relative comparison would be like writing slushy romance novels for men and wondering why ladies dont buy them.	[]
"As a women, I rather watch action packed films like John Wick, Pacific Rim and even Marvel films but the last couple of Marvel films have been shit.  I didn't mind Black Widow or the last Guardians of the Galaxy because the story wasn't always based on ""Women Power"".  Black Widow has always been a bad ass but her character didn't act like a dumb bitch like Miss Marvel.  Guardians Rocket story was a must because we didn't know what exactly Rocket had been through and didn't involve an all WOMEN cast.  Nebula in the film has grown to become a better person, pretty much everyone in that film has involved and need to move on.  I'm excited for Deadpool 3 but also worried if somehow they try to please the WOKE agenda.  GOD I HOPE NOT!!!"	[]
I would just like to point out that, even before the era of suicidally woke garbage that we have now, the vast majority of genre projects were still garbage. That's why the handful of truly great works that were created were so beloved by fans. Stupidity is really nothing new in Hollywood.	[]
"The thing I never understood is a lot of these writers to be ""toxic masculinity"" on men, but then still decided to put those toxic traits on women. 

An asshole character is still an asshole regardless of their gender. Even moreso if the character's personality is a plank of wood with ""asshole"" written on it."	[]
"But 10 years of trash has pushed me away. I have other intrests now and I am not coming back.

It's almost like you need collaboration from men, women and anyone with intimate knowledge of the subject matter in the writing room working together to make a cohesive story that appeals to audiences and not just one or the other making a story to drive personal agenda or messages that apply to a specific market.

"What I would like to see is the story of a female superhero that has to be reigned in by her male counterparts. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, females tend to go scorched-earth if you wrong them, they have almost no capability for forgiveness. This manifests mostly as a war of character assassination and manipulation waged non-stop until one side capitulates, or everyone has chosen a winner. Now what if that woman had the powers of Wonder Woman or Cpt Marvel? She would have no limitations and could shift it to a physical war. The one that wronged her would be eliminated and so would her friends and family. Why not? Who‚Äôs gonna stop her? If you want a taste of this, go watch _‚Äô‚ÄôMy Super Ex-Girlfriend‚Äô‚Äô_ and ask yourself how frequently that would happen with female supers.
         The real problem is that they aren‚Äôt just telling the story of a woman discovering her own strengths, values, and beliefs and putting them to use, which could be (and has been) done right alongside male characters.
          Instead, they tell the story of a woman (not to be confused with female human) that doesn't really behave like a woman discovering that she is incredible because she is a woman. There is no risk and payoff for the woman character. There is no gratification for achieving something amazing because she was always able to do it. She doesn‚Äôt earn anything, and she doesn‚Äôt change.  Instead of a story about how great she can become, you get a story about her forcing everyone else to agree that she is great, always has been, and they were wrong all along. (Sound familiar?)"	[]
"Action/Superhero movies, like sports, are an analog of war. People that go to Superhero/Action movies want to see someone overcoming serious challenges with calamitous consequences, either using skills and abilities that they have earned the hard way (like soldiers, Batman, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, etc.) or using a God given talent (mutants, divine gifts, etc.). They want to leave with the hope that they can be like those people and that they can overcome their own conflicts, and those imposed upon them by others, to protect and provide for their own. Those stories are purpose built to satisfy masculine instincts.
         Contrast that with romances/musicals/dances/dramas that are (mainly) about teamwork and interpersonal relationships. There seem to be about 3 main types. They want to see a woman that comes know herself and wrestles with her perceived flaws successfully, then go out and be a successful woman with a fine man in a supportive, caring community, that looks to her for advice and leadership. They may just want to see the woman character getting the good, dependable, alpha male that will take care of, protect, and provide for her for life. Or they will want to see the woman overcome the different personalities, available resources, and environmental conditions, to create a solid, effective, cohesive group that can care for and nurture each other and their charges (children, community). Again, stories purpose-built for feminine instincts.
          Instincts that are defined by your chromosomes before birth and that 95% of humans have. In point of fact, you have to be born mentally defective ‚Äìby definition‚Äì to not have those instincts. Even people born with physical malfunctions still have those instincts, it is ONLY people born with damaged brains that do not. Psychopathic or  mentally retarded babies are the only ones that fall into that category ‚Äî all others must learn it."	[]
Has there been any rise in women audiences for action, scifi or fantasy movies since these‚Ä¶ contemporary movies?	[]

"The top 3 movies in 2023 were Barbie, a colourful movie aimed at a women based on one of the most popular toys for girls, Super Mario, an adventure movie aimed at children with one of the most iconic video game characters saving the day, and Oppenheimer, a grim and dark war movie aimed at men about the invention of the nuclear bomb in ww2. 
It's almost like if you respect your viewers and the source material your movie is based on, and if you tell compelling stories your target audience wants to hear instead of political messages you want them to believe in, your movie has good chances of being successful, no matter who your target audience is."	[]
How and when did anyone in Hollywood think that Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Diana Prince(from the Wonderwoman TV show), Alice from R.E, Barbarella,  Princess Leia, Katniss Everdeen, The Bride, Xena, Dana Scully etc, etc weren't admirable female characters?  This 'Strong Female Character' trope is code for 'All men are idiots'. Of course those characters will look good against a background of mediocrity. But none if these horrendous Mary Sue's can hold a candle to actual interesting flawed and imperfect proper female characters.	['They were ignorant of the past on purpose so they could hype their underachievements as being stunning and brave.']
"If any further proof is needed of what was said in the video, you need look no further than the 2024 box office  no.1 and no.2:
No.1 : The Beekeeper - 143 million : A Jason Statham action flick where we get to see the man be a badass and deliver explosive action and good hand to hand combat scenes in spades unlike in The trench 2 or the Expendables 4 (because not like Tony Jaa or Iko Uwais would have given any potential for a few good brawls and not like the precedent was not set in the 2nd movie in the franchise with Scott Adkins and JCVD as villains who fight hand to hand too against Jason and Sly respectively). 

No.2 : Mean Girls - 101 million Rom com musical

2 movies with a clear target audience that give the said audience what they want. 

Sure, it's only been 2 months into the year and Dune is soon to release and will probably surpass them quickly, but still, when's the last time a Jason Statham classic action flick ,or an adaptation of a Broadway musical dominated the box office?!"	[]

"Hollyweird forgot you can have kick ass female characters who aren‚Äôt 100% infallible and aren‚Äôt god tier at EVERYTHING they do, simply to push a message of woman = good and man = bad. 

They also forgot that you can have a kick ass women, without stripping away every single female characteristic. Ripley was kick wss, but also a mother figure. Trinity was kick ass, but still feminine and sexy. Princess Leia was kick ass, but still kind hearted and vulnerable. Yu shen Lien and Jen Yu (crouching Tiger hidden dragon) were both kick ass, but still feminine and beautiful."	[]
"I didn't even hear about Madame Web until it had already hit theaters and the critics got to it. From what I've seen in the clips shown by these critics all I can say is it just looks boring.

Well that dropped the mic on that	[]
Hope this madness ends and we return to normality. How many flops its going to take for Hollywood to fix it.	[]
Doesn‚Äôt help that they completely sanitise the characters as well. They never put a foot wrong never say or do a wrong thing they are just so bland. Asexual types.	[]
"Does anyone see how all this ""pandering"" might actually just be money laundering? 
Disney, sony, marvel, amazon etc are multi billion dollar companies who will always have plenty of money, so the producers just need to present an idea of appealing to a demographic that seems like an unttaped groupe free for the taking and in the meanwhile is just non existent. In paper it sounds good, so the investors just willingly throw money away into whatever project comes up and the producers and whatever party involved in their plan pockets the money.

This might be another good reason why movies nowadays cost way more and everything is way worse, first thing that comes to mind is the terrible cgi despite of the budget being over billions of dollar. 

Its a good explanation as to why they keep on making these sorts of pictures. Cuz its been dozens of failures, and no studio seems to be stoping."	[]
"One of the biggest drawbacks of the ""girlboss era"" is the ""all-or-nothing"" approach they've been taking. They seem to think a movie starring both a strong female character(s) and any strong male characters that are vital to their story in the source material ""ruins"" the female ""representation"" aspect. Imagine if Madame Web had stuck to its apparent original plan to include Spider-Man. Would've probably gone over MUCH better with audiences, and increased the visiblility of the lead female character organically if it had been done right"	[]
"Ugh the fact that hollywood thinks that ""designed for female audiences""  means ""hey just slap a bunch of women in in the cast and crew and don't give two farts about the writing or worldbuilding"" is insulting. As a woman, I don't WANT a ""movie designed for females"". I want good writing, fun logical action, and good worldbuilding and if making movies for ""male audiences"" is going to give me that, then I'll take it! Bourne, Wick, Pacific Rim...none of those were DeSiGnEd for WoMeN but I still love them for their writing and/or charm. And if this shit is what hollywood is going to keep giving ""female audiences"", I'll simply go back to Tolkien and Sanderson. Grinds my gears."	[]
Honestly as a guy who watched and enjoyed Barbie, I only remember half the plot because it resonated with me so much more than the other half. I think that a lot of men can relate to and understand Ken, and to me he was by far the best part of the movie.	[]

"It's so arrogant of them, because if they lowered the budget for the niche audience they were aiming for. They'd be able to make a profit and establish these girl bosses as a brand. Even with the comics they don't do this. Instead they try to subvert the characters the primary audience actually wants to see.

Anime/manga has all sorts of weird genres. These activists probably could've found their audience, if they weren't so eager to change all of society in the process."	[]

"""The Silk Spider Society will cater more towards the male audiences."" ... right. I'll believe it when I see it. It may start off that way so Hollywood can draw the audiences back in, but they'll do what they always do: make small changes to the script over the first two seasons so you won't notice unless you're really paying attention, and then in the third season... WHAM! Right back to ""Women Rule And Men Drool!"" 

Sorry, Hollywood... I just don't believe ANY of your BS anymore."	[]

"Dear Critical Drinker,

This is the first video of yours that I felt compelled to respond to. I agree with the premise of this video, but I feel like you got sidetracked from the real problem. The failure of the film industry isn‚Äôt because studios are trying to cater to new audiences, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre making garbage. 

In your examples, you used Maverick to point out how male centric movies couldn‚Äôt appeal to women and asked if we wanted to see a movie about a female pilot who struggles to balance her work with her home life, romantic life, and more. Actually, yes, I‚Äôd love to see that movie. If it was made well.

The reason why these movies are failing isn‚Äôt because they try to appeal to everyone, it‚Äôs that they do so in a clumsy, stupid way. The first two Alien and Terminator movies show a strong female character in masculine movies that appeal to everyone. The reason why these movies are so successful is because they are done well. We still remember and watch them decades later because they are that good.

Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and other recent Disney films don‚Äôt appeal to anyone because they are poorly written, poorly cast, poorly acted, poorly directed, and just end up being shitty movies that no one remembers a couple of months after they release in theaters. It isn‚Äôt because of gender, it‚Äôs a matter of quality."	[]

"Imagine if you could write a good, strong female lead into sci fi that everyone can like? Say maybe a space ship captain who uses her knowledge and toughness to fight a race of face hugging Aliens.... Or maybe a female lead who is relentlessly pursued by (and fights off) time-travelling, self-aware robots because her unborn son will lead a revolt against them in the future?

A strong female lead in sci fi can definitely be done successfully and hopefully will again, it just doesn't have to be the sole purpose of the film."	[]
Could, or indeed should we, imagine a male centered romantic movie?	[]
Need more Blue Eye Samurai Mizu and less Star Wars Rey	[]
The last movie I saw in theaters was Top Gun Maverick. Funnily enough, it was because my mom wanted to see it for her b-day, so my family took her out to see it and we all had a great time. She skews the graph a bit because she likes action movies, but it may also be due to starring a seasoned action star in a sequel where the hero isn't cucked and actually has a satisfying continuation/conclusion of his story which can pass the torch while also honoring him as well as the male actors that starred alongside him in the first movie. There are also a lot of hot guys with no shirts on and no apologies given about that. I think that may have a part to play.	[]
"Drinker, you still don't get it do you? Hollywood isn't about making money through direct ticket sales. 
They appeal to Woke Investment group because some of them actually has the powers to bully corporation who don't follow their line. And then they blackmail and threatened to blacklist those who work on the blacklist. 

Then, the analytic companies are just a pyramid scheme investment scams, who's biased toward ""attention"" regardless of positive or negative and don't care about profit. 

With those two compined, the sheer lack of balls in hollywood caused everyone to pander to imaginary investors. 
And now, by sheer size and number, they force their way through. 

It was never about pandering to imaginary customers, it was about pandering to imagninary investors. 
And well, when both are imaginary... Hopefully the system isn't fucked enough that they'll be able to get away from it longer.

"I have a better idea to recover the film industry. Hollywood won't try it, but if they ever do they'll make bank. Only about 10% of the population is ""Progressive"" or ""Woke"". That just means they are Communists, and they don't watch movies that often. Most people are tired of them, so make movies that shit all over them. You can't do that forever, maybe just a few years at most, but it would be a VERY profitable few years, and would help ensure that kids growing up now aren't as retarded as these last couple of batches."

"100% on the nose about the failure of putting tits on a male superhero.  Girl bosses do just fine when they're done right.  The Queen's Gambit, the Hunger Games franchise, Anna, several films about Elizabeth I, the Avasarala and Camina Drummer characters in The Expanse, three or four of the ""girl bosses"" in Game of Thrones, even True Blood...  There just has to be a sensible depiction of actual female strength.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit well into the typical Hollywood formula."	[]
"I doubt it‚Ä¶ hollywood is balls deep in the depopulation agenda being pushed by the marxist/communism WEF and black rock.

Wrong. This is a long-term tactic with billions if not trillions of dollars invested from ESG/DEI/CRT NGOs and Elites that plan on altering the mentality of culture, history, and children.

This is generational warfare and cultural decay and disrespect. Even if they start doing right by Men and Fans, their crap should only ever be pirated to make a point: Never again.	[]

"Another proof that social engineering never work, you may force it on people for a moment but the reality always end up imposing itself in the end.

For a good decade now studios decided for some... weird (and very bigoted) reasons that EVERYTHING must cater to a specific segment of the population (women), and as it turns out, that doesn't work, ESPECIALLY when what you are trying to sell is something that women are not interested in in the first place.

Let's hope the lesson is FINALLY learned, now that EVERYTHING has been burned to the ground and money is getting low, and let's hope they will get back to make product for people that want it rather than trying to force an audience to change so they will consume your product.

Btw, while they tried to force women to like what they don't, the way they have treated men didn't work either.
Apparently they thought men would not only consume your slop no matter what, even if you insult them to their face and tell them the product isn't for them."	[]

I went to school with people of all races, outside of some off color humor ( which all parties agreed to an chuckled at ) NONE of this was even on my radar. I don't think younger kids these days will ever believe that things really used to be so much better.

"Let's zoom out just a little more to the societal level. The ""girl boss"" idea is not working for the average woman in most places around the world. For the reasons you've already mentioned, men and women are different. Are there some ruthless women that control board rooms, yes... are most women suited for that level of pressure, no. They never will be without literally altering their DNA. Our world is moving incredibly fast and I do not have all the answers... but none of this is working for anyone. Men and women..."	[]
"Whenever this topic comes up, I always think of Bill Burr's bit on the WNBA.  He rightfully blames women for the failure of the WNBA.  Why is the responsibility of men to watch the WNBA?  Women got what they wanted (or thought they wanted) with their own league, so why aren't they watching it?  Because they are busying watching a lot of things (like the Kardashians) that they really like but don't necessarily want to own up to liking.

Same thing applies to these movies.  The claim is that women want to see themselves in these movies.  They want to be the action hero lead.  They want to be the strong superhero character.  Great, then here are many movies in a row meeting that exact request.  Then all these movies flopped.  Don't blame men.  These are movies tailored for women at (supposedly) the request of women.  So where is the female audience?  Why aren't females supporting other females in these movies?  

Because the majority of women really never wanted these movies in the first place."	[]

"Also, men make up most of the theater attending audiences. As stated in the video romantic comedies are mostly female audiences and the most successful of all time is a foreign film called Mei Ren Yu at 525million. The number two is Pretty woman a 30 year old movie at 432 million dollars. 

Out of the top ten highest grossing movies one is a def primary female driven movie at titanic which even that's a little debatable because men love disaster movies. Beyond that all of them are men primary movies. 

When you cater to the audience you should you see massive success. Look at Barbie a female audience movie has 1.4 BILLION dollars, beauty and the beast 1.2 billion, cap marvel 1.1 (that was at the early stages of girlbosses though so people gave it a chance) after that you get twilight who almost made a billion. 

Play to your real audience not the one you want but the one you have and if your movie is worth a damn, you make money period."	[]

These films have been doing the exact opposite of this. Sure, do what you can to appeal to mass audiences, but not at the expense of alienating your core audience."	[]
Well the political agenda was horrendous and made films unwatchable for sure, but to be frank, they mostly shot themselves in the foot by NOT MAKING GOOD MOVIES!

"'The Death Of The Girlboss?' - Critical Drinker

""We can only hope."" - The Doctor"	[]
The irony of using Top Gun Maverick to show the differences between male and female focused movies is doubly ironic in that Top Gun Maverick did have its own 'girl boss' in Phoenix. She was more than capable, she could go toe to toe with the guys but at no point was she treated as being better or more worthy than any of them and better yet she wasn't used as a ham fisted attempt to try and teach the aged, more experienced established male protagonist some sort of deep and 'meaningful' lesson.

One of the strongest female characters I ever saw was Casey Seeger in the movie ‚ÄòAn officer and a gentleman‚Äô played by Lisa Eilbacher.  The type of strong female character Hollywood refuses to write anymore. She cries when Sergeant Foley yells at her because she struggles with the physical part of the training and doesn‚Äôt have enough upper body strength to get over the obstacle course wall, she struggles self doubt, in short, she acts like an actual human being.  Despite this she perseveres and at one point when Sergeant  Foley is attempting to get Richard Gere‚Äôs  ‚ÄúMayo‚Äú to quit, Foley points out Seeger, working on her upper body strength to try to get over the wall, and he tells Mayo that she might not make it but she has more heart than he‚Äôll ever have.  She eventually gets over the wall as Mayo encourages her, not because she has to have a man‚Äôs help but because Mayo sees her as an equal, if one makes it we all make it.  She gets over the wall and becomes a Naval officer.  That, my friend is how to write a strong female character.	"['Well stated and excellent point. üëè', ""I don't think this represents the kind of thing women enjoy watching as she is trying to be equal and women (despite the propaganda) don't really want equality.

When she got out of there, she needed a moment to steel herself, so she could keep going."", ""Such BS though. We don't need women as officers period. That alone paints the movie as ridiculous.""]"

I don't think trying to appeal to the wrong demographic is the main here, but rather it's shit writing. Even your statistics show that the romance audience has a significant 15% male section, the action audience is a whole 30% female, and the sci-fi/fantasy is a whopping _35%_ female. With these numbers, even if your themes are dissonant with the genre, the losses may be measurable or significant but not catastrophic. A competent writer could probably pull off Top Gun: Maverick with the feminine themes you mentioned, pivoting from an action to a military opera.	[]
A shame we had to lose so many good franchises and talented actors while Hollywood figured out to wring out this tired concept.	[]
"Can we add Netflix's ""Alexander: Making of a God"" to that list. I had to stop watching through the 3rd episode. Maybe I'm just a bit jaded by all the strong and empowered ladies in modern times, but I watched Alexander, hoping to see a military themed show of male leadership. I'm sure the women played a significant role in the real people's lives, but if you watch that Netflix show, it feels soooo forced. In almost every scene where an important decision is made, it's almost as if the men simply can't function without a woman to guide them, warn them, or point out something they need to do. I really hope I'm not jaded. Either way, I'm not watching the rest of that."	[]

I am a straight, white male, aka satan. My favourite movie is Aliens. Counterintuitively, Ripley, arguably the strongest female protagonist that has appeared in an action movie is weak(compared to the marines and the aliens), has no formal combat training and she is scared and vulnerable. These weaknesses allow the character to show bravery, intelligence, skill and experience. It helps that a great actress played the part too.	['I have seen Sarah Conner being mentioned in T2 as well and again I would fully agree. Both movies directed by James Cameroon, a man.']
Drinker, why don't we use refund-bombing to destroy the new movies coming out? YellowFlash told us that Madame Web had a lot of refunds and cancellations after you guys in pop culture destroyed it on youtube. This is new. I wanted to know what Madame Web's actual box office was after the refunds. Obviously they weren't enough to make a dent in the box office, but what if we make sure they do next time? There was nothing false or misleading about Madame Web's box office, because the theaters and ticket sellers simply stated their takings. They couldn't have known people would want a refund. Moving forward, can we use refunds as a new metric to judge a movie's performance at the box office? Wouldn't the threat of mass refunds force the studios to make movies people don't want a refund for? How humiliating would it be for a studio if one million people cancelled and got a refund for their movie? A ten minute youtube video that sucks is ten minutes of your life you'll never get back. A ten minute video from you, telling us not to watch a movie, saves us two hours of life wasted. There's nothing illegal about what i'm suggesting. We are all free to buy a movie ticket and then cancel it to get a refund, if we think the movie will not be what we expect. That's where you come in. There is no way for the studios to combat this. They can review embargo until the eleventh hour, but no-one will go to the movie until you greenlight it. By then, if it's bad, everyone will already know it's bad and tell the whole world it's bad. Is this a new era of tactical refunds?	[]
"One can only hope that the day of the annoying Girl Bosses are numbered , I wont hold my breath waiting however :-) 
I recently watched a light fluff action movie 'Ghosted' on Apple which thankfully had an enjoyable female lead, who yes was OTT 'kick ass' but still had femininity and worked with her male co-star not totally against him or belittled him at every opportunity. Pity there is not more of this as its getting to point where I am 'primed' to hate on all female leads sadly."	[]
Alright I've heard this from multiple YouTubers that girls don't like action or superheroes. It's not that we don't like action or superhero movies. All the woman I know will sit down and watch a good action. We love the strong tough guy coming in, having to learn and grow  to be able to kick ass, and save the day. We just don't like this she boss crap. It's boring to watch a movie where the girl is never wrong, knows everything, and can beat anyone. They make all the men either washed up or stupid and weak, then the girl has to save him. For the women who love having real masculine men in their lives, we don't want to have to save and protect them that's not our role. So we can't relate to this trash or believe it. I'd rather see a woman like Sarah Conner she was tough and strong but couldn't do it all. Also I think Barbie did so well cause it's something that pretty much every girl had growing up so it was nostalgic for them. A bunch of parents also took their kids to see it too which helped with the numbers. Even Tyrus took his daughters to see it twice.	[]

Even after a decade of girl bosses I still don't mind a strong female character but give us a Ripley, Janeway or Leia. Women can be strong without being fighters. In Brimstone (2016) you see an excellent example but even if they need to be badass, Leeloo (5th) was always fragile in certain aspects. Maybe they should just get the romcom back out and lets us have our fun back, because I don't see the writing improve any time soon.	[]
"I just finished True Detective season 4. 
The pilot episode had me intrigued. There was a hook that I thought was interesting. It had John Carpenter / ""Lovecraftian"" vibes. I didn't particularly love the two main characters. Female law enforcement officers written with so much masculine energy it was kind of comical at times. Around episode 3 I started to realize what was going on. Every male character was either incompetent, weak-willed, corrupt or evil. And from there the story went pretty much exactly where I thought it would."	['Glad i never saw it, sounds cringe.']
Halle Barry in John Wick was a great example of how they could appeal to both genders in movies.

The truth is Hollywood has never known what people want. They've just enjoy the luxury of a captive audience. But now with so many streaming services, movies and TV shows - the general public's attention has been pulled away from entertainment they don't want to be bothered with and it's finally showing on the bottom line. Just watch, Hollywood will still continue to fail. It's run by people who don't realize how out of touch they are with everyone else	[]
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm so still so angry about all of the franchises they have destroyed  over the past 10 years, even if they turn things around, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready for forgive them and start spending money on them again. They taught and trained  me that I don‚Äôt really need new content, there is plenty of old content and other things to do for entertainment. Maybe another 10 years of them apologising, grovelling and begging me/us to come back while they lose another few Billion is in order‚Ä¶.that sounds like actual justice to me.	[]
I must be manly cause i prefer the movies for men by far. If doing a girl boss, thin Ripley. There are plenty of girls in movies that did it right and didnt diminish men but not recently.

Silly you.   Reality and logic are foreign concepts to the left-wing Hollywood studios.  They clearly don't care how few people see their movies or how much money they lose as long as they get to check the all-important virtue signaling  boxes with each and every one.  Yeah, and dont hold your breath waiting for anything better from Amazon either. It is easy to write press releases suggesting a course change. Let's see what they actually come up with.	[]
The girl boss mentality comes from insecurity and sexism,  but the same can be said of those who reject the idea as well. If we seek characters with flaws in them, are we simply bringing them down to our level? If so, isn't that a form of pandering?	[]
"A flawless, overpowered character who solos through an action adventure could still theoretically work and draw in a large audience if it has two main ingredients, because the main thing mary sues lack isn't weakness or good teammates, but charm and charisma. Characters like 007 or Superman could still garner a lot of fans because of traits like James Bond being suave, smooth and charming and Clark Kent being an earnest, good hearted, all American farm boy, despite the fact that they do fit the gary stu mold. 
The problem is that if you're a girlboss, you are legally obligated to have the worst personality traits of all time, a loveless, sexless, joyless, narcissistic, misogynistic, misandrist show-off who only cares about gaining power and fighting le patriarchy. I can guarantee you that a lot of people would have been on board with characters like Rey or Captain Marvel if the marketing around them wasn't so garbage and if they had some charisma. Rey could have had an infectious, excited fangirl energy and a lot of ""scrappy underdog from a backwater planet, rising against the odds"" appeal but they wasted that potential. As for Carol though... I don't think you can salvage her with anything from the MCU, but with the older comics depicting her as a careless, alcoholic party girl, you find yourself the blueprint for a heroine that people can cheer for and get behind."

I think many of this films come from the idea if they make an all female superhero movie they be able to expand their audience to the female one but forget that females they trying to woo don't want to see frumpy girls trying to act like men. Instead they want a cute female lead being pretty, dealing with a love life with ass kicking while cool being second to them. Look at things like Sailor Moon or recently the Barbie movie. What a woman would want from a superhero movie is not some girl boss acting like a man. You can't just write a male centric movie and replace the men with women and call it a day.	[]
"They have sort of ruined it for themselves ( female lead movies ) because there has been so much trash, that  when another one comes out , people will automatically label it "" woke "" and rightfully so.

Mary sues are boring , and what makes it worse is they portray men as weak feeble idiots . To see a 5ft 5 110 pound girl beating up many big men just kills it."	[]

It is astonishing how little research Hollywood did into this. I write books. I am very much in favor of DEI and indeed figured out how to do it well in books like 25 years ago.  Emphasis on the word, 'well.'  Men and women have different fantasies. People may not like that, but there it is. It is amazing that no one in Hollywood said, 'look, there are ways to do this,' but erasing men from action movies is just absurd.  That is not how you do it.  Men who see romances were dragged there by their wives or girlfriends. Women who see superhero movies were dragged there by their husbands or boyfriends. Eliminate the desire of males to see a superhero movie and guess what? There's no one to drag women to see them.  Duh.	[]
God bless you, Drinker!	[]
Hollywood seems to have forgotten what truly makes a character great is the inspiration they impart. And that comes from their personalization. Princess Leia isn't a strong female character--she's a strong character who happens to be female, and she's easily the most inspirational character in the entire SWU. She became a feminist icon because of her tenacity, heart, compassion, toughness and love.	[]

"What I'll never understand is why would the money men in Hollywood take this risk in the first place?
They must know about demographic preferences, it's literally their job to know what to finance and the risk associated with it. So why take a risk making an expensive action movie with expensive trainers, CGI artists, fight choreographers and so on when a romance movie is going to be 90% cheaper? Hell, Hallmark makes ten Christmas romance movies for the cost of a single Marvel movie's CGI budget. It seems like complete insanity to not see that."	"[""They got sweet ESG money during a time where funding was easy to get. They expected that they were going to build a new larger audience that would offset any of the lost one.

But it took a real effort of will to try to be fair in how I viewed all the evidence--and it also colors how I view his roles in movies. Since I don't like the person--Johnny Depp--it's been hard to enjoy any roles he plays, simply because of him being so vocal politically.

"This is not foolishness. Most of the writers may be mentally- and emotionally-stunted imbeciles who simply want to see themselves self-inserted onto the big screen, but the people who do the hiring and sign the checks - the suits at the top - are not simply out-of-touch goons who think this will sell: they've had far too many years to see that it doesn't, and have seen that it doesn't sell in comics and TV before movies and games. This is still a focus on social engineering. These people's progenitors infiltrated the west from the Soviet bloc circa 1924. They're fine with playing the long game. They'll just tone back the indoctrination and get back to work eroding our collective morality, cooperating with their cousins in academia to further unmoor us from our history and any old tales that could teach universal morals.
Some of them genuinely believe this is for the greater good, that they need to destroy all existing morality and norms to properly train us into being drones in their communist utopia. But those with the real power are not so nebulously benevolent, and have frequently been quite open about their desire to see us all enslaved, our cultures erased, melded into one ambiguously brown morass just smart enough to work in factories but not smart or independent enough to retaliate."

I always loved female characters growing up.. Lara Croft, Catwoman, Storm for a few examples. They were cool, confident and could hold their own. But they weren't unlikable jerks who could do it all.

"Honestly, can we have female centric stories that are not about girl power, fighting patriarchy, female friendship or romance? Can we have female protagonist who isn't Mary Sue created as a role model for little girls ? As much as I usually prefer male protagonist I admitt that female centric story set in SF/fantasy/horror/action-adventure genre can work if protagonist and her story isn't about ""girl power"" but explore different more universal and interesting themes. Recently I was watched two such series, both of them animated; ""Blue Eye Samurai"" - seen upon recommendation from Drinker - is about woman obsessed with vengeance, another one; "" Frieren: Beyond Journey‚Äôs End"" is about 1000 years old Elf having problems connecting with people since she knows that everyone she knows will die long before her...

Ellen Ripley is the golden standard of a female badass lead. As a guy, I was rooting for her the entire movie amongst the majority of the male cast. I wanted her to win till the end.

"I find most super hero movies boring and unrealistic. Obviously, the ""super"" part has to be swallowed while also expecting that person to otherwise act like a normal human being.

Today's guys have spent their childhoods and teen years playing video games and imagining what they'd do if they had some kind of super power. 

I don't know what the ladies have done other than tea parties, dolls, Barbies, makeup and imagining the eventual wedding they keep putting off until after college and after they've established their careers.

They've been lied to and confused over the last couple of decades by bitter feminists who go too far with their ideologies which has confused ladies ""future planning"" and crushed their budding imaginations. ""Romance"" and marriage has been demonized and is ruining today's young ladies. 

Guys continuously pollute their minds but fueling their imaginations with endless video games comics and animation, never quite growing up. 

But they know what they expect to see with each new super hero movie. 

They recognize bullsh¬°t when they see it and demented feminazis denigrate them unfairly as chauvinists when they don't like what they see.

Men have _allowed_ women to become like this so blame men. They've also failed to take charge and be the leaders the population needs. When men don't step up, women fill the void and we get what we have now. 

It's still mens fault. Women wear the pants in the family while the husband acts like a grown child playing video games all the time. This forces the wife to take over HIS responsibilities AND hers while he diddles himself like a little boy.

Neither have been raised right either which is what's causing the collapse in our society. Our culture has been denigrated to the point it's also demonized and ridiculed.

Nothing will hold us together unless we have a common culture. We don't anymore so our future is screwed.

China has a strong culture. So do all Arabic countries. So does Russia. 

Western civilizations time is coming to an end because we refuse to embrace a common culture. 

Clearly, democracy is a failure."	[]
"Every single time I see directed by, marketed by, created by women. I'm not going to see it especially for superhero movies. I love superhero, action, sci-fi, fantasy set pieces.

"This reminds me of Prego and their FAILED attempt to find one perfect pasta sauce.

In the 70's IIRC, Prego was trying to engineer their pasta sauce to be ""perfect"", so they could corner the market and sell more sauce, and make more money. They had whittled their sauces down to 2 kinds and wanted to know which to go with, spicy or plain sauce. Enter Dr. Howard Moskowitz, market researcher and psychologist. He was hired for his previous work with Pepsi, who tried to determine the ""best"" amount of sweetener in Diet Pepsi. Turns out, there was no uniform consistence across their audience, in fact, it was fairly even across the board. Can you guess what happened next?

When Dr. Moskowitz was handed the Prego project, he developed 45 different types of spaghetti sauce for testing and found there was an ENTIRE kind of sauce that Prego was ignoring. CHUNKY. Turns out it was a three way tie between what those kinds of sauces. Well, Prego decided to listen to him and make the new sauce to see how well it performed. The result was $600 million dollars in 10 years from the chunky sauce line alone.

"1 I can totally confirm that the two sexes have different tastes. Both in the university and at school, most of the students in my class were girls and they definitely didn't look like the type of people who'd go watch Top Gun or The Terminator (there was one exception, but she was raised as a dude). They had no interest in metal and gaming, let alone sci-fi and darkly inclined fiction. I was one of the few girls that were actually into that and in my university class, I was literally the only one. No matter how offensive it may sound to chronically online people, women who enjoy action, gaming and all this other stuff (especially women who are masculine on top of their masculine interests) are a minority. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that. I think the problem is that said chronically online types seem to equate someone saying ""women tend to like romance and melodramas"" with ""women are not allowed to enjoy action and thrillers"", when the latter is NOT what people are saying.

2 I think the problem is that they're not exactly portraying masculine traits, but rather what they THINK men are like. Instead of portraying genuinely masculine women (if that's the hill they want to die on) like Rain Ocampo and Vasquez from Alien, they choose to portray snooty, rude and insufferable women who often overpower men in spite of being ordinary humans. It doesn't help that acknowledging that Rey and Carol Danvers are Mary Sues is now deemed sexist, even if you're a woman yourself. 

3 Mary Sues are a separate topic for discussion, but they are pushed like female empowerment. As someone who has rose tinted glasses regarding Paul Anderson's RE franchise, I'm thankful that Alice was never pushed as an icon for female empowerment. But even Alice had an excuse for being so powerful: bonding with the T Virus. Mulan from the live action remake is an ordinary human and doesn't have that excuse. I'm not empowered by someone who never struggles and never has any issues in life. I'm empowered by someone who has issues and overcomes them.

4 These stories are written BY chronically online people FOR chronically online people. We as a general audience are only taken into consideration when it's time for us to be guilt tripped by them into watching it. There is a way to promote feminist narratives without being performative, condescending or hateful, but it's clear that they just want to turn their Tumblr 2016 rant into a full length movie. They are also the reason why beloved franchises are ruined. Notice how people don't have an issue with Jinx Johnson and Michelle Yeoh's character from Tomorrow Never Dies, they only have an issue with Captain Marvel and Rey, so the problem is not sexism, but chronically online people being given the opportunity to do something they're incapable of doing: writing a good story.

5. There's a clear lack of diversity in women, i.e. diversity in personality. This gap in western media is why East Asian media is winning now. Not very long ago, you could see different types of women in media: calm, loud, extroverted, docile, active, you name it. Now it's a copy paste of the same type that you know you'll see in pretty much every western female character today."	"[""Well said!

It's really taken this long for most of these to realize they can do a better job not watching trash and keeping their mouth shut rather than pretend all that garbage is anywhere near good.

"Drinker, a female will watch ANY genre that is well-written and reads recognizably human in character. Too much is being made of what girls like or boys like. Every female I know loved Top Gun - Maverick (Tom Cruise sold the ticket, the writing, action and acting prompted more than one viewing). We gave Aquaman a try because it had Jason Mamoa, Thor because of its hot, genial lead, and dare I say Barbie worked for some (I still don't understand the Barbie love) because of a very fine Ken and smart marketing. We are thrilled by an action-crazed, suave James Bond.

I love Sci Fi, Westerns and action movies. But ONLY if they're good. Girl boss movies are never good, regardless of genre. No female ever woke up and thought, ""I'm hankering to see a girl boss movie no matter how shit*y."" Hollywood's definition of ""girl boss"" adds to the revulsion."	[]

"the funny thing is, there's plenty of successful franchises with male target audiences while also having plenty of strong, female characters from japan, anime is in part pushing comics out of the western market because the people that write that stuff understand how to entertain an audience

my favorite example is always the Fate franchise and the extended Nasuverse as a whole as it is easily comparable to Marvel, both are massive multiverses with plenty of different writers for it and recurring characters and yet the most popular character from the Nasuverse is Saber who, on the surface, goes through the same stuff as these modern Marvel ""girlbosses"", it also has the male characters looking down on her but she shuts them up by showing how much more powerful than them she is, hell she even has the struggle of having to hide her gender to be taken more seriously in her position, but unlike modern Marvel, she actually has well thought out writing backing her, interesting character traits, believable and relatable weaknesses and fears and her character arc even includes reconciliation with her own femininity all while she is still being a girlboss that kicks all kinds of ass and while she is certainly the best writing wise, she's by no means an exception"	[]

"Fun fact: most women don't even buy this narrative, even the ones that watch these movies. 

I used to be a part time freelance photographer for some dance academies during my college years (I also had a scholarship and took dance classes in one of them). I remember one day (around the time the first Captain Marvel was on theaters) I was leaving one of these academies after a class and there were a few moms outside talking (I was the only male so they knew me and they always said hi to me), they were talking about Marvel movies of all things and every single one of them said how much they DIDN'T like Captain Marvel and that she came across as so unlikeable while they were mentioning the heroes they actually liked like Captain America and Bruce Banner. It was kinda funny. 

None of my female cousins liked Captain Marvel and neither of them were interested in the sequel. My mom and sister didn't watch the first Captain Marvel when we watched Endgame in the theater but they did not like Captain Marvel in that movie. 

These big companies can't even pander properly, the few females who appreciate these movies even in a casual way don't like this narrative! Lol"	[]
The one gendered joke they did in Maverick was funny when the lead cocky pilot told the lady pilot he called you a wingman and she said that‚Äôs fine as long as he doesn‚Äôt call you one!  Lighthearted jabs is the way to do it.	[]
"I used to love superhero movies, action/adventure movies and romances.  But I don't like whiny women in any movie.  I would have taken my husband to see Maverick: Top Gun in the theater, but the bits of the movie I've heard included a woman complaining something about ""that's why they call him Hangman, he always leaves you hanging,"" and it grates on my nerves.  As far as romances go, no tv show can do a romance: if two characters have good chemistry, they split them up immediately, have them sleep with everyone else in the cast, and they might finally smash them back together when no one cares anymore.  And romantic movies are a thing of the past.  Barbie wasn't a romance, and Disney's Snow White refuses to be as well.  I hope DailyWire's Snow White and the Evil Queen is a success and they start showing it in theaters.  Help us, Brett Cooper, you're our only hope."	[]
Thing is, most men don't have a problem with strong female characters. And the women who like action and superhero movies don't require a strong female character to latch onto in order to enjoy the story. The thing we can all agree on regardless of sex or gender is that we just want well-written stories and well-written characters. Studios are constantly dehumanizing their audience by seeing us as just numbers and statitistics, and are simultaneously  desperate and half-assed in trying to cater to specific demographics when, if you look at the majority of, say, recent superhero movies, most of them have been bad, regardless of whether they were male or female centric. They were just badly made.	[]

tbf, we need the voices of discontent and calls for change; however we also need a realistic assessment of consequences. Marginalized groups are by definition are small, regardless of their disproportional presence on social media. Younger people historically (and necessarily) fight against the establishment -- because the establishment is the seat of money and power. And over time the younger generation becomes the older generation. FFS, we should know this.	[]
"It's this simple!!!!! Thank you Drinker!

Look at women in male orientated movies. 2 shining bastions - 

Sarah Connor. Ellen Ripley. Both in movie aimed at men but still written as women. They're still feminine. Heck, Ripley's maternal instinct, even though she's terrified, forced her through hell for Newt.

And Sarah? Not only would John not exist without her, he wouldn't have been anywhere near as capable of a leader as he is without her. Iron sharpens iron but Sarah was the blacksmith that forged John.

Keep up not only the perfect breakdown and insight but all the laughs!

Really appreciated.

Cheers!"	[]
I believe the situation far more cynical. They haven't given up one bit on their final goal of ideologically brainwashing an entire generation, they've just realized they have to do it more gradually. The very fact that men might be happy just to see a superhero movie that doesn't treat them like complete cr*p is just a testament to how far off the cliff we've already fallen. You can bet that even such movies will still contain copious doses of 'the message' and most certainly will never come close to challenging any of the pervading social orthodoxies.

"""the girl boss concept is dead"", yeah right. If it was, as he says, influenced in any way, shape or form, by sales and revenue, it would in fact be dead, and have been for 8 years, because nobody cares about girlbosses.

Except it is still very much alive, which means audiences don't drive the change which means it is not so much ""dead"" as it is ""rebranding"" because, accept it or not, they accomplished their goal: skew the scale so far into lunatic leftist territory that old school feminism now seems like ""balance"".

When you think of 'strong women' there are lots of role models to choose from. Of course they don't have great physical strength, but they do have enormous moral and character strength.

As a woman who enjoys movies that would typically be considered for a male audience I still don't want girl boss tropes in my action or sfyfi or fantasy.

This would represent a profound abuse of course. It would have abusive effects on the ""99 Percenters"". Consequently it would guarantee that Donald Trump will become the next president of the United States. So, what would Donald Trump do to the dying Global Liberal Order? I think that we all know the answer to THAT question! Perhaps after this all plays out over the next few years, we will finally be able to enjoy movies again."	[]

"People who are ideologically driven don't give up until the house collapses under the weight the collective hubris. Watching Downfall (2004).

Anyone with a functioning brain must have known the war was over a year before Berlin was literally surrounded and getting pounded by Russian artillery, in addition to Americans advancing from the west.

The Germans had lost long ago. All the evidence was there. If any leadership truly cared about German society, they should have accepted defeat and surrendered to America to get the best possible terms for their people.

But they just couldn't admit they were wrong, and that their visions of being the chosen people in a ""National Socialist"" world order, was pure ego and hubris crumbling to dust in the course of history. That they were flawed humans who messed up and did horrible things and now it's time to pay the price.

The leadership was so arrogant, that they were willing to drag their entire society down with them, just so they didn't have to admit they were wrong. The leadership's defiance against the entire world around them wasn't a brave last stand, it was a temper tantrum in the face of reality.

It's a testament to how far people will go for their own self-righteousness."	[]
I (35f) mostly only ever watch Fantasy and horror and USED to watch superheromovies. As someone who is their target demographic, I hate these modern movies.

"I dont know why we act as if these things are not figured out and they are being surprised. The calculations of appealing to a group does not make sense if you do not have a good movie in the first place. If it is a movie that sucks, it will appeal to no one, so the statistics you get are literally white noise and useless.

It is not hard at all, just make a good movie first and than worry about other things. Why do people even bother analysing this, if it is a movie with no redeeming qualities, it will fail, regardless of any other circumstances."	[]

"The problem with the likes of _The Marvels_ and _Madame Web_ isn't that they're female-oriented superhero movies. The problem is that they're utter crap.
It's quite possible that female audiences might like a female-oriented superhero movie that was actually well made, but we may never know, because I don't think there's ever been one.
I had to coax my sister into watching _Aliens,_ but she loved it. And I loved it too... the fact that it was female-led and delved into issues of motherhood and women's issues with not being taken seriously didn't at all reduce my enjoyment of it just because I'm male and also like explosions. People on both sides of this argument are taking the wrong lesson from the failure of recent movies. Nobody of either gender likes terrible movies, and that's got nothing to do with which gender the movie was made by or for."	[]
Completely on point, Drinker.	[]
"2:55 Keep in mind, when it comes to audience demographics:
The reason women make up 85% of Romance films, and men only make up 75% of action movies; is because generally speaking, Women are more agreeable, and will tolerate a movie for men. Just so they can be with the men in there lives. So a Girlfriend going on a movie date with her Boyfriend, or a Mother taking her son to go see the new cool action movie, or a Sister catching up with her Brother and stopping by for a movie. But Men generally speaking, are more confrontational; will not go see a Romance no matter if the woman wants to or not.

So do not think that because more women will view an action movie, than a men will view a romance; that it's advisable to market action movies towards women. The women who go to action movies, don't care for the movie."	[]
The thing is it's harder for them to win the interest of the audience that already left.	"[""Yep. They can fix it all. I'm still out."", 'Harder is not impossible.

If Hollywood fixes its myriad issues, I will watch its movies again. But I won\'t return to franchises like Star Wars and Star Trek, which are in my mind forever tarnished.']"
"Here is the reason that female action heroes often wind up being so insufferable:
In real life, women are seldom the action heroes. They are sometimes, but not typically. A male action hero, in the real world, is a fairly common occurrence. Well over 9 times out of 10, when someone wins a battle, rescues an old lady from a burning building, kills a lion, etc., it's a man. And why is this important? Well, because male action heroes are so normal in the real world, you can't make a whole movie based on the concept of ""Look, it's a MAN doing action hero stuff!"" You have to give him an interesting personality, a character arc, etc., otherwise he's indistinguishable from every one of the hundreds of millions of real-life male action heroes that have already lived. 

But with a woman, that's not the case. Women are not commonly in action hero situations in the real world. They are sometimes, but not typically. And so, for your movie to stand out and be interesting at first glance, you don't have to put any effort into your female action hero. You can make your whole movie based on ""Look, it's a WOMAN doing action hero stuff!"" because that's something that you don't see every day.

And what's the problem? Because you can ride this female action hero as your only original thought, the whole phenomenon is going to die out pretty quickly. If you're completely obsessed with your girl power moment, you'll neglect the personality and character arc of your hero. And this is how you get Rey beating Kylo Ren (supposedly a combat expert) in her first lightsaber fight ever, Captain Marvel completely obliterating anything she comes across, etc. 

But it can really become a balancing act, because if you try to focus a lot on the more realistic, character, non-super-girl-power aspects of your female action hero, things can easily fall apart. Women, on average, are smaller, weaker, and (dare I say) more timid than men. Any woman who is going to become an action hero on par with most realistic male characters is going to go through immense amounts of training, failure, etc. before she can beat most men. Trying to demonstrate this on screen is inevitably going to look a lot different than what we currently have. 

The world is tough. In most combat scenarios throughout history, women have been almost non-factors. There have been exceptions, like Soviet female snipers during WWII, and the growing number of female combat troops in recent years, but in general this is a rule of thumb. This isn't to say that women have been non-factors in history itself - history is much broader than just combat scenarios (Which probably make up less than 1% of human history all told.), and women are undoubtedly just as important to any functional civilization as men, on a ton of different levels, and in some instances even more important. All I'm saying is that integrating them seamlessly into action and combat is an unrealistic undertaking. It's going to be a bumpy ride, and any movie that attempts to bring them into combat has to recognize this."	[]

Ever try to win an argument with a woman who believes she is right? Facts...don't matter...data...doesn't matter... quantifying results...don't know what you are talking about! The ONLY action that is going to course correct the industry is LESS women making overarching decisions. That's not misogyny...that is reality. Women are not built for data, logic, result based decisions...they are built for nurturing...protection...and aesthetics alteration (facts that USED to be in textbooks) and #MeToo put them in the driver's seat. They NEVER cede ground voluntarily, or compromise or make decisions based on concrete observable fact over feelings. Take a look at our illogical society that is coming apart at the seams because of decisions based on personal animus rather than continuing health. Unless there are some firings and rehiring based on meritocracy this is not going to reverse. It's dead, Jim!	[]
The problem is that Hollywood has gone down this path of madness for too long.  The talent that was able to produce blockbusters by knowing what the audience wants and how to give it to them is mostly gone, replaced by unqualified leftist ideologues.

We have also become so soured on Hollywood that nothing short of an abject apology is going to get us back.	[]

Add some spicy romance that follow the rom com agenda but doesn't destroy tension or the threat of the male hero or threat of the villain.

Hay Critical Drinker, as a woman myself I 100 percent agree with you. I grow up in late 90s and early 2000 seeing badass actresses  like Angeline Jolie, Charlize Theron, and Milla Jovovich in the screen but one thing I noticed about those early movies is the female characters always working side by side with men or a lover which made the movie all well more interesting and exciting. I don‚Äôt understand why nowadays female leading films have to hate on men and create this division between each other. I miss those good old days. I guess it‚Äôs because of the woke era but even myself has a women hates all this new generation garbage films. üòÇ Keep up the good work I love your channel! We need more honest opinions like yoursüòÑüëç	"['In almost 60 years on this earth, most confidential and honest conversations I\'ve had with females have involved females communicating that they ""don\'t like other women"".\n Who am I to disagree with pattern recognition?', 'Careful!! The feminists may cancel you!!!', ""They want to create a strong character that isn't tied or tethered to a man in any capacity. The issue arises when you focus too much on the woman aspect and not the actual character.\n\nFurthermore, the reason why these new movies with women don't work is because we don't view women the same way as men. What I mean by this, is that most movies have an invincible man archetype who is super powerful, barely gets injured or hurt, knows their stuff, competent, and has little hindrance. The problem is, if you put a woman into a similar setup, she reads as boring, bitchy, girl boss, etc. Now take in genre, these women are being placed in. It's all superhero nonsense. Most women don't care about that so they won't watch it and most men care about t and a, so they won't watch it either. \n\nWomen in movies are limited, especially if they are written by a man, and I personal dont relate to female characters whose interest are in nurturing or relationship building. So I stick to horror, where the women can suffer and have character growth.\n\n\nAnd woke just means being aware of social injustices.

I dont believe its necessary and I dont think it's a controversial statement to make.

Especially since the demographic you need to show up to the film also has typically more testosterone than estrogen pumping through their bodies.	[]

"Drinker got it right, as always. Bravo. But I think there is still something much worse behind all of it. It's also about this prejudice on masculinity that so many people have today. The death of the ""Girlbosses"" was just a battle we won. But the prejudice is still out there, strong and kicking. The movie Barbie's success is a very good indication of that. Maverick was successful and had zero female bashig. Barbie central plot was male bashing. I mean, I really think things are far to be alright."	[]
Good rant, excellent opinions.	[]
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the fact that these films don‚Äôt reach out to their targeted audiences (even though that‚Äôs one of the main cases of why they fail). It‚Äôs just also the fact that they are just writing so many bad female characters. One of my best friends at work stated that she‚Äôs getting tired of the independent girl-boss not only because it‚Äôs become a terrible troupe, but also because of how mean spirited they are towards everyone around them. If they could make these types of characters more likable, compassionate, and vulnerable towards other people that would certainly make these films better in the audience‚Äôs eyes.	[]
The girlboss project was not just an experiment in cinema, it was an experiment in human nature. Now the whole thinking world can see that feminism and this era's neo-Marxism is a failure, just as many of us calmly explained at the start.	[]

"I disagree with the premise that it was a simple mistake.  As Nerdrotic mentioned in another talk, iirc, the damage has been done.  You can't undo all the horrible films that are now part of a franchise legacy.  And that was always the goal.  Business 101 teaches us that you don't make a multi-million dollar flop.... and not learn from it so the flopping doesn't continue.  When the first flop happened and they openly attacked the fans, heads should have rolled and a course correction been applied.  That you didn't see that means that someone is either violating Business 101, or they are doing exactly what their backers wanted.  As the old saying goes - ""Once is an accident. Twice is a coincidence.  Three times is enemy action.""

Time after time, yet people don't want to believe it's genuinely enemy action.  That's too uncomfortable, especially because people feel like there's no way for them to protect themselves or to counterstrike."	[]

"As a female anime fan, I also think that when Hollywood tries to attract female fans to a usually male dominanted genre of film or franchise, they seem to have no idea what the female fans are drawn to. It has been what males like but lazily insert female protagonists with little or no personality outside of being snarky. 

 I think shonen manga/anime has been understood how to attract female audience to male genre. Making the male characters attractive, have a few supporting female characters with at least some personality, then sprinkle some interpersonal conflict/relationships/comedy in between the action and adventure scenes. You got yourself a female fanbase."	[]

The thing is, the plummeting testosterone levels may not be happening fast enough to deal with the increasing hatred of these pubescent girl bosses of all sexes and ages that run the Federal government.  But, wait!  They have a plan!  Make the hatred grow so intense that it lashes out at the ""diverse"" immigrants flooding into their neighborhoods, and failing that, lash out at the executives of the NGOs and corporate executives of the monopolies that are the emissaries of the pubescent girl bosses of all sexes and ages that run the Federal government!"

Better Call Saul is a recent example that I always think of when strong female characters/girlbosses come up in conversation. Kim Wexler is one of the best written female characters in recent memory. She‚Äôs extremely smart, capable at her job, strong willed and relatively fearless, shit she could probably be a better conman than Saul himself, but she also has clear flaws and a ton of depth to her. She isn‚Äôt perfect and is actually quite an awful person at times. Every scene with her is fantastic and it helps as well that Rhea Seahorn is a phenomenal actress making it all work.

I partly agree with you, but I'm nowhere near as optimistic that they'll either change the movies they make, or that it will work if they do.  As far as changing their films, they've fired and blackballed most their older and more experienced writers and crews.    As the Drinker himself has pointed out, the replacements have neither the talent nor the life experience to write believable stories and characters.  You can't teach a fish to walk, and in order to return to the stuff that sells that's what they're going to have to do.  They've also managed to piss off a big chunk of their audience so much that they're not coming back no matter what the studios do.  Beginning in about 2016 or so they've let the masks slip off and told us what they really think of us, and it ain't pretty.  Maybe they always felt that way about ordinary people and hid it well, or maybe their utter contempt for their audience is a recent phenomenon, it doesn't matter.  They've showed us what they really are, and now many of us are done with them.	"['When their leader told you that you were ""Deplorable"" she meant it. We should not finance people who hate us.']"

"My wife has enjoyed all of the Marvel movies...until Captain Marvel. She hated her and she's hated nearly all of the movies after End Game. If she's supposedly the target audience you'd think it would be me saying it's bad, and my wife trying to defend it. Instead, she's the one going on about how bad they are and I'm trying to defend them at least a little bit. The nail in the coffin for her was Scarlet Witch. They spent all this time making her an interesting character just to turn her into a crap villain. She HATED that and I don't blame her. She also cares nothing for Rey in Star Wars. She loves Mando which is arguably the only male-centered bit of Star Wars still around. So who's this for? My wife has never seen a trailer for anything recent and said, ""I'm buying tickets, we're going!"" It's always me. So why would they undercut my interests to fail at trying to gain hers. Just like you said in your video, she loved Barbie, and told me directly not to bother watching it. She knew I'd not care about it. All things come in waves, this too shall pass."	[]
I don't think it takes a marketing genius to discover that people are not ideologically motivated. In fact, they are motivated by merit. We like winners, greatness, overcoming the odds, flawed perseverance that captures humanity. That doesn't cut along gender lines. It's why women don't watch the WNBA. It's why they didn't see Madame Webb. Only in the sick and twisted echo chambers of Hollyweird are people broken down along these ridiculous demographics. There is biological and objective reality and no amount of social engineering by propagandists can change that.	[]

The creatives that have been put in charge for the last decade show no evidence of having watched the great movies of decades past.  Start with Katherine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck in the 30's and 40's, then move to Lucille Ball, Doris Day, and Sofia Loren in the 50's and 60's, Jaqueline Bisset, Ann Margret, Pam Grier, Sigourney Weaver.  Modern creators and actors think women of prior decades had no agency, simply dominated by men, but these were capable individuals who carried considerable power in the industry. Every decade since has had its amazing actresses and female characters, but you would never know it from the uninformed slop that pours from the mouths of today's Hollywood players.  Ordinary people like me shouldn't know more film history than the people currently making films, but it increasingly seems that we do.	[]

One of the interesting things that this woke turn men into women assumed was the more freedom women get the more they'd be like men till men and women were basically the same.  Turns out if you give women freedom to be women they become more feminine and less masculine.  This is most obvious with career paths where you get the most female engineers in places like Iran and India and the least in places like Norway and Sweden.	[]

"30/70 female/male in superhero viewers? They are not even making 30% of their precious sale is what so funny to me, they are not even making movie to ""appeal"" to the female viewers."	[]
The YES men and women are starting to re-adjust their cultural message because they finally recognize the toxicity of their past approaches. But there is a hard core of social cultural manipulators who've been trying to create nothing less than a new society by changing the morals, sexual practices, and culture of the young. They thought they could use their control over the mass media, the education system, corporate America, and the government to re-educate the younger generation to behave according to their preferred beliefs. So they may be in retreat but they're not beaten yet and they won't go down without a fight.	[]
I think a big reason why all the male Disney characters are written as women is because the only men left in the writing rooms are male feminists, which basically makes them women as well.  Maybe if we snuck some testosterone supplements in their morning half caf, low fat oat milk vanilla chocolate sprinkle frappacinos, one of them might finally grow a pair of balls and be able to write a half decent male character and then free his fellow male co workers from their hormonal prisons.  Kinda like that scene in Solo where the SJW droid is freeing the other captive droids only not super gay and poorly written.	[]

If you replaced all the female characters with men The Marvels and Madame Web would still be hot garbage. There‚Äôs plenty of ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù movies like Kill Bill, Alien, The Hunger Games, Mad Max Fury Road that prove it doesn‚Äôt matter the gender we just want a good fckn story. The real action/reaction is that Hollywood has spent decades pretending that only white men tell stories and now the reaction is for them to think just putting a woman or a person of color on screen is enough. Just make them super OP and the women and people of color will start flocking to the theaters and white men can feel less guilty about enjoying their film slop. ‚ÄúWoke‚Äù is such a corporate scapegoat it‚Äôs crazy	[]
Madame Web made me watch Morbius and Cats. After watching it, I don't think those 2 movies where that bad.	[]
Franchises. This has to stop. I don't want franchises. I want new, creative stuff	[]
Barbenheimer was a novelty _because_ of the contrast between the two movies. Their target audiences couldn't be any more different and that's why people found humor trying to mash the two concepts together. The result was that both movies were successful and neither's success reflected badly on the other. In fact, both benefited from the Barbenheimer mania that made going to the cinema feel like a significant cultural event.	['Yes good point, I even remember the poster of the main characters together, the scientist holding barbie on his shoulder.']
I think it affected children more than adults. I'm a teacher and I often hear more boys liking girlboss characters. Having said that, there's still a substantial group of boys and girls who cringe at the same characters.üòÇ	[]
"You'd imagine a ""business person"" saw a statistic and thought ""hey, there's plenty men watching our movies, but not that many women, how can we get more women to watch it"" without any understanding at all on why each demographic watches what.

My wife and I were just talking about this last night.  It's like our entire society no longer believes in Biological Reality, so they make crap that makes no sense, then wonder why it fails because they refuse to accept that Men and Women are different.  In every way, they're trying to make Men's view of success, a Women's thing, and it's just not.  So I liked it when drinker thought what if Barbie was made for men.  Put a twist into everything Hollywood has been doing lately.  Great Video.	[]
I think Barbie also appealed to the foot fetishists	[]
Why is it more interesting watching videos about these movies, than the movies themselves!?	[]
At the end of the day the quality just isnt there as much. Writing is terrible for the most part as theres a forced message behind everything. Just make good movies and regardless of whether its macho or feminist, people of all genders will enjoy them if they're just written well	[]
Seeing the clips of Rings of Power is funny since the writers and everyone involved in that show ended up making a pretty good female lead character that was believable and a positive role model it just wasn't the one they tried to force. It was the reluctant leader of the village (Bronwyn). Solid character and far more endearing than Galadriel. Even Nori was a better female character. Galadriel, as written/acted, suffered the same problem as Michael Burham in Star Trek: Discovery both were extremely unlikable characters as leads in a franchise.	[]

Women power is different to men power. Frank Herbert knew when he created the Bene Gesserit. I'd like to see more of that sort of believable female power, with as you say, protagonists I can relate to.	"[""Lets hope they don't ruin it in the subsequent dune movies. I always appreciated how influential the Bene Gesserit were throughout all of Dune; from high ranking political infiltration to kickass fighting to the creation and manipulation of an entire planets' religious beliefs, they really were terrifying"", 'Yeah, but the difference is that Frank Herbert was a genius,while the current crop of Hollywood writers are simpletons.', ""Yep, women power is different than men power. Even the Bene Gesserit had male generals, like Miles Teg, to lead their male armies  ...because women do not make good soldiers. \nThat's why I find the Fish speakers all female fanatical armies of the God Emperor as a laughable concept (see the real life equivalent of the women warrior enforcers of the King of Dahomey who got their asses handed to them by French soldiers who bayonetted hundreds of  them in CQC while sustaining only 5 or 6 causalties )\nAnd this is coming form someone whose first tabletop army  was sexy warriros nuns in power armour wielding flame and faith to smash the enemies of the Emperor of Mankind  cca. 40000 years in the future ;)"", ""The Bene Gesserit could kick the ass of almost any man alive.  The Honored Matres in turn could kick the BG's asses.  However in both cases it's merely a matter of training and mind control and men can achieve the same thing.  The BG only recruited women because they were secretly developing a breeding program and needed to not only mate the right people together, they needed to control both time and gender of any offspring - something that is internal to a woman's body.  For proper mate selection, BGs were trained in advanced seduction techniques that no man could resist.  Trying to force it the other way would have been more difficult."", '@@gunkulator1 yeah no shit with mind control powers a woman can beat a man, wew']"

"The idea that a genre heavily in favor of one demographic needing to be remade so more people will like it, misses the whole damn point, because people can already watch any genre they choose. According to the graph at 3:18, mostly young women watch Comedy films. But I, an older male, love comedies. I don't need a Comedy written for my demo, just make it funny. 
Adding a young female lead to a SciFi film only caters to the women that were already watching SciFi films. Sure, you'll draw in some female tourists but they're not going to stick around. How many people watched the Disney Star Wars trilogy simply because it was cool to do so? Hype has an expiration date."	[]

Hollywood seems to be plagued by guilt for 'disrespecting' women for decades. Instead of looking at equal representation in front of and behind the camera, there's a strong desire for payback against all men.

"A major flaw of both this film and the marvels isn't the characters or the actors involved. The flaw is the writers and potentially the studio forced re writes that messed up the vision. They are both rather poorly written. In the case of Web it's not only poorly written, but it's poorly filmed based on every review I've seen that wasn't paid for by the studio. 

Girl boss films could work if they had a good story, had good filming, and in the case of hero films, had a recognizable hero. Wonder woman didn't appear on the list of girl boss flops. Morbius didn't either but should have. 

Because the problem is the c grade super hero character films are being written poorly, or with studio interference, and filmed poorly, and in the case of girl boss films often with an agenda in mind. I suspect that when a film comes out and the insiders at the studio know it's tested poorly but they are releasing anyways, they start to push the dumb agenda to try to push for a female audience with lesser expectations to show up and use the culture war to push the film. Ghost busters did this. The marvels did this. Webb did this. All were panned as really crumby films."	[]
"One of my favorite movies is Kiki's Delivery Service. How can this be? How can a grown man identify with a story that centers around a 13 year old witch girl in a fictional 1950s Europe?

"We are in a political period where The Wire, Breaking Bad, True Detective S01 & The Sopranos could not be made for network TV or Streaming. 

Film has always been hit or miss - we love what we love but just don't watch most of what's made. Social media just allows us to pile on those unwatched movies - which I guess is its own form of entertainment.

"Bill Burr said it best. Where are all the feminists!? They should be lining up around the corner to support their fellow women. But no, women have no desire to see women come together and work together to accomplish a common goal. Women would rather watch superficial fabricated drama just for the sake of drama. They will stampede each other to see a woman tear down another woman. Women hate positivity. Their natural default setting is to complain. 
I really think back in the 80s and 90s society put so much focus on the behavior of young boys they completely ignored the development of young girls and now they‚Äôre running rampant with their emotional nonsense. Please put a focus on putting your daughters in STEM. We need more women in these fields."	[]
While I agree, I think Barbie is a poor example. The main reason it did so well was the marketing. Barbenheimer massively boosted the movie's potential viewership and the actual marketing for Barbie itself emphasized the fun and silliness of the movie over its messaging which would've been a turn off for a lot of people had it been more honest.

That is the ultimate goal of modern feminism: women who want to be like God, who tolerate no restrictions and only do what they want. That's called an ego trip. That's why these movies don't work, because these women come across as totally unsympathetic, because they are no longer concerned with love, but with power and self-realization, which is the motivation of the villains in the old fairy tales and the heroes are those who are prepared to risk everything for love. A strong independent woman should not be a mother and take care of her family. That's totally misogynistic.	[]

Well Drinker, I would have to challenge your idea of male vs female audiences. Marvel studios prior to Endgame appealed to both genders because the makers of those movies didn't insult anyone. The modern entertainment industry hates and insults older, light-skinned, heterosexual men. Since most people (men and women) aren't bigots, most people don't like their products.	[]
In what other business would this model work?  It would be like a restaurant  continually bringing the customer the wrong order and wondering why the customer is unhappy.

What\'s the matter, you don\'t like international foods, you bigot?""', 'Like expecting bald people to buy combs. ""grrr, those baldies are bigots because they don\'t like our pink combs!""', 'This only strengthens the common suspicions that Hollywood movies nowadays are just a way to launder money.', ""This only happens when politics overrule everything and the people who realize this doesn't make any business sense are afraid of their jobs and remain silent.\n\nIdentity politics and DEI are ruining the western world, but at least in the world of business there comes a time when reality sets in when those political decisions are cratering their business. Either go broke or radically change course. And when it comes to money, sweet money, it'll finally be game over for woke Hollywood and the woke MSM."", 'Well said.']"

"Catering to ""The Message"" is merely a consequence of studios having already squeezed the blood from the stone of their target demos and the executives tasking creative to find new demos to fill additional seats and increase profits. Top Gun didn't need to cater to a different audience. It had it's audience and it delivered. Same with Barbie. But Marvel and superhero movies in general have tapped the same well for 20 years. They need to find more fertile demos so they went to women because that demo wasn't saturated. Even at the risk of alienating the existing fans who made superhero movies what they are. When capitalism is involved, stagnation is failure. Growth must come regardless of the cost. Even if it costs everything."	[]
This was never about money thats where you missed the point CD. It was always about pushing leftist woke idealogy. Its about trying to force cultural shift via entertainment.

So for a few years they might retrace just enough to scrape an audience back together but I doubt it.	[]
Very nice video. Thank you.	[]
Seems a lot like wishful thinking.	[]
The girl boss is a flawed boring concept. If your protagonist has no flaws there is suspense, or tension. Because your hero will never make a bad or questionable decision and therefore will be no consequences to your hero's decisions.	[]
One thing that everyone forgets due to the hating of this female genre that they fail in basic story telling and sticking to the oldest archetype of: the story of a Hero. Mulan is a perfect example how to tell an engaging story with a female character where her gender is secondary and it works because this formula is as old as civilisation. No one would have any problem if the stories and the characters were good, but the problem is they both lack creativity and natural ingredients.	[]

I really hope you're right about the Girlboss Era being dead and over Drinker. Creativity in Hollywood has been badly affected by this trend, and the worst thing is that it didn't even need to happen. Propaganda is people's worst enemy, and it drove a number of figures to pump out movies that needed to educate men about how they were nothing but sexist pigs that deserved to be looked down on, humiliated and emasculated, while women needed only to throw off the chains of the patriarchy in order to become their true selves. People came to watch the movies to escape that kind of thing, not to have it be constantly shoved down their throats. I only pray the pendulum is truly starting the swing the other way, however I fear it may be too late for the likes of Star Wars and Marvel. The damage has already been done there as far as I'm concerned, and in the case of Star Wars, there's no sign of Kathleen Kennedy's stewardship being challenged, and people can't tell me Dave Filoni because I don't think he's got any room to manoeuvre there.

I think the movie and entertainment industry has been irrevocably damaged. I think they have entirely destroyed everyone's confidence in entertainment as an institution. When the boomers are gone, no one will watch their stuff anymore. The core demographic will be either conservatives/normal sane people who have had enough, or leftists who have no money and are never happy. I really don't think that they will ever be able to win back conservatives and older gen z/younger millennials. Especially young men in their 20s and 30s. Society is far too fractured for it to be healed as far as I can see it, and cultural institutions like these are a perfect microcosm of that. Gone are the days of shared experience and culture. And gone are the days when studios had to care about creating things that were broadly appealing and generally good. all we have left are the ashes of what once was.	[]
I don't mind sharing my hobbies with women.  I don't care about your crotch configuration as long as you enthusiastically enjoy the same things I do.  But don't move into my hobby and then try to force a change to that hobby to more closely reflect your ideas about gender and sex - especially if that hobby has almost nothing to do with gender and sex.

"What movie is the ""Oh man, Oh God Oh Man"" clip from?"	[]
I want to raise another point: Men are the ones that drag their female partners into the cinemas. Females are mostly perfectly fine watching their content at the small(ish) screen at home. And most of the stuff they watch works absolutely fine on a decent TV set. But males like the big movies, with all the effects, explosions, big armys and fights. If the males have no desire to go into the cinema to watch a girlboss blundering through a trainwreck of a story, both and the rest of the family and friends stay at home.	[]
The only one of those statistics I'd kind of like to see closer to 50/50 is the science fiction one. But then, I grew up reading really old sci-fi like Asimov and H.G. Wells, where the science fiction was more about thought provoking ideas than just fancy tech. Being asked to think is something that should ideally appeal to everyone (should, not does). At least it's the closest to that number.	[]

Well said...The only question now is - is anyone listening?	"[""They'll either figure it out or they'll go broke trying."", 'How many are listening remains to be seen, but as the video pretty clearly pointed out, it appears that some people are starting to listen']"
The Hulk TV show actress, and actresses, cannot even act. Discounting all the woke messaging and propaganda, I could not get to that because acting was so piss poor. I use to really like Iron Man and first Captain America. Then it was more about the military captain or major friend of his. Then the guy with wings was more important then Captain America. Spiderman actor sucks too. So for me, things were going down hill for that franchise before it totally crashed. But they were able to burn a large number of White male's careers. So for them, job done. That was their goal, and not entertainment. Ask the new head of marketing at Budweiser if you can be more inclusive and wider in scope without insulting 80% of your existing customers. She did not learn that in school, and with little real world experience for the job she was just given, she had to learn it the hard way. By destroying a 60+ year old great brand. I'll never drink another Anheuser-Busch product  again, along with about 20 million others that feel the same.  Similarly Disney killed off any reason I had to watch any movies in this franchise. So long Tony, Cap.	[]

"So, instead of getting badly-written girlboss characters we're gonna get badly-written male characters like in Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning.

"Anime specifically tends to write some of the best female characters. Like Nami from One Piece is a woman with dreams and aspirations, knows what she wants and how to get there, but recognizes her limitations and that she can‚Äôt do it alone. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs loved.

You can apply this kind of character analysis to so many. Like Kagome from Inuyasha, Rukia from Bleach, Hinata from Naruto, Casca from Berzerk before the thing we don‚Äôt talk about, even female leads like in Sailor Moon, heck even characters that you love to hate like in Monster. The thing they all have in common is flaws, being human, being vulnerable to those flaws, and growing as the story progresses. None of them are stoic or trying to be men. Japanese male writers can be quite liberal a lot of times but even they understand that men and women are different and have different personalities that allow for unique storytelling perspectives that the other gender would more likely not be able to as accurately fulfill"	[]

The problem is ideology, a cornerstone of Communism, is nurture over nature (genetics). The belief that environment is all, is why they persist in the face of manifest failure, they believe that men can be women and women can be men, given the right amount of education. For them to change, they are in effect forced to admit, that Communism doesn't work, and that bleeds into so many cherished beliefs that have failed (Comprehensive Education anyone?). Until the Communists are removed, they will continue, until bankruptcy, which after all is the inevitable end result of socialism.	[]
With so many wars going on in the world, even a moronic observer will note that men run towards the danger, or are sent towards it against their will. And women generally take the children and evacuate to safety, and a few make TikToks in combat cosplay. The oversaturation of Girlbosses onscreen is not chime with the world we are living in. The art does not imitate life, and life does not imitate the art in the genre of women-pretending-to-be-men.	[]

"Throwing a bunch of women into a film brand that is primarily supported by men does not make said film one that caters to women. You see dear reader; women don't care to see a bunch of female characters running around unsupported by strong male characters. Women will watch and enjoy superhero/action films if there are strong men they can look at and fantasize themselves or the female characters having relationships with. Sexual tenson and the other things women find attractive about males and females working side by side and playing off each other are very important. Unless she is a radical misandrist the average woman will be turned off by a film that promotes the message that women don't need men. This is why the girl boss must die and it appears as though her end has finally come. The failure of 'Madame Web' along with 'The Marvels' before it is what it took to get the attention of studio executives who surely must be livid over the billions of dollars woke activist filmmakers and writers have cost them. 

There was a brief moment when it looked as though the woke mindset was on its way to changing the world. Every SJW in Hollywood jumped at the chance to get their crazed fantasy projects made with the blank checks studios were handing out like candy. The free ride is coming to an end, and I can't be more pleased to see the rejection of the insufferable girl boss."	[]

When i look at girlbosses i loved in the past year they have all been videogame characters. Most of these were the characters i myself customized and created. Games love making you feel like a boss so naturally playing a girl makes me a girlboss. Secondarily when i look at NPC girlbosses, the ones i liked most were very vulnerable at times which required more strength from them than turning a demon into a strawberry slushy.	[]
Disney lost me years ago with their Last Jedi crap.

The problem with the Girl Boss character is that most of the time they just make them so unnecessarily hyper aggressive, cruel and the only males in these are either incompetent, bigoted, or the biggest simps you'll ever see.

Oh my friend I do admire your optimism. But after years of producing painfully obvious crap just to push a message... I fear things won't change in Hollywood.

Tires are just spinning in the mud.	[]
"Great commentary, imho.
I thought your Barbie-Maverick comparison was particularly effective.

But this 'girl power' movie set is not fueled primarily by studios, imo - but by society.

"Last year, a book called MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios was published. I came across it in a comic shop in Manchester. I was almost convinced to buy it until I leafed through the book and came across the chapter on Captain Marvel. The authors blame ""sexist nerds"" for the character, her actress and her movie dying on arrival. That chapter is a perfect example of a lack of accountability which has become the norm in recent years. Unless you're heterosexual, white and a man, it's never your fault. It's racism, sexism, etc. 

MCU: The Story of Marvel Studios was published in 2023, and aged like milk before it's even a year old. The Marvels, Echo and Madame Web have all been trainwrecks. The way these people have tried to handle the situation is the equivalent of trying to put out a fire with petrol."	"[""Hmmm whos' gonna buy a book like that.  Clearly the title is misleading."", 'The book also ironically acknowledged that the M-She-U is real.', ""Thanks for the warning. I'll skip it. I'll wait for a more honest book."", ""Funny thing is they claim the 'angry nerd audience' is just a minority but also claim that the same group is to blame for tanking a movie. Cant have it both ways."", 'Exactly']"
I'd also like to see a few new ghost stories with male leads. Paranormal horror has primarily been the domain of female protagonists for over a decade now.	['Have you watched The Black Phone and Sinister? Both of them star Ethan Hawke.', '@@maryapple7108, I have. Both solid üëç']

Plenty of my female friends enjoy scifi, fantasy and action movies, and would be happy to watch a good star wars movie with a female lead.

That's unfortunately becoming a rarity in a media world trying to mass produce content and squeeze every penny out of an IP as soon as possible.	[]

Your take on barbie is definitely construed by the idea of it being a movie just for women. Sure they're are more dominant female characters and ideals, but that doesn't make it designated for women. me and my buddies had a blast watching it and found the comedy to be quite hilarious. If you really think its a movie just for women then why was the only award the movie won a music award for ryan Gossling's song in the barbie movie that was also written by men.	[]

Judging from that graph at the beginning of the film of the sex preferences of men versus women, what someone who wants to make a film that will appeal to both sexes would be to make a science-fiction musical.

This is probably the video that i agree with the most out of every one i hate nerdrotic specifically because they literally are racist (blue beetle review and some of the cast have used racial slurs on camera) but yeah trying to appeal to female audiences they normally shoot themselves in the foot trying to change the demographic however as a straight Hispanic male who grew up on action films and novels movies like captain marvel or madame web don't appeal to my demographic, i feel like blue beetle got treated unfairly because honestly i grew up watching young justice, batman tbatb, and even the dcau movies that honestly made me appreciate the character that got me interested in the Jaime reyes comics. Not to deviate but when any writer has an original idea to include women or poc you have to know what genre you're writing i honestly have a few original action scifi pitches that include native american, mesoamerican, and even modern Mexican, like there's catalogs of ideas to pull from that include poc like TUROK, or Justicia who are the justice league team in Mexico, the Chinese justice league with Kenan Kong as their superman(his origin is tied to the death of the n52 superman) and so much more Hollywood writers now adays are mostly diversity hires that only got the job because of a small degree when there's more writers that are diverse enough to make the content that fits what people really want	[]

"As a woman, I love fantasy, sci-fi, and action movies. What I don't love are poorly written characters. I don't relate to a woman who ""Can do everything"" and is ""perfect"" because that's not real life. Whether the protagonist is male or female, if they have flaws and work to overcome them, I will be able to relate to the story."	[]
I'll watch every movies again before I watched Barbie a second time.	[]
This works both ways. It would be great to also see some fun comedy targeted more at the female audience. Taking my girlfriend to see rome-come wouldn't kill me either.	[]
"Ironically, the ""girl boss"" trope could have been really successful if the people making these movies held themselves to some kind of objective standard, other than;

 ""The main characters are all cocks, well let's put women in those roles and noone will notice... Even if we overtly point that out by putting captain marvel in a ""cock pit"" ü§î"	[]
Can't really tell this story or change the direction until you address who is being given the reins to produce, write, cast, and direct these movies and TV shows.  Too many come in with counter-productive, extraneous viewpoints and agendas, and are often given opportunities above their skill sets and creative abilities.	[]

"I honestly don't think that any of these franchises can come back, they have attacked fans and made dreck for so long, even if they make something good, nobody will show up (look at Andor).  

Side not: I still debate Barbie's success.  Barbie and Oppenheimer were suddenly successful because of a bizarre internet meme.  Furthermore, Barbie deliberately misled audiences into believing it would be a fun movie with Barbie going into the real world (hearkening back to the old fun kids films of the past).  But it was highly political, ends with a random lady (not even Barbie) going on a rant about how ""impossible"" it is to be a woman, and Barbie going to the obgyn....Adult me rolled my eyes hard, and I think little kid me would have been horrified by this film.  I don't know any women who speak well of it, and I don't know a single little girl who was gushing over this film after it came out.  The sequel can't pull this trick twice, and I suspect numbers will DROP."	[]

"Now, pay close attention here.  Women make up 85% of the audience for romance movies.  You know what that means?  Men don't even go to see those movies with their wives/girlfriends.  The same is generally true for women with superhero movies and comic book stuff.

You see the same idiocy in how leagues like the NFL are seeking out new audiences."	[]

All I can hope for is that more and more people stop giving them money and that their fabled modern audience sticks to selling ass and shallow activism on tiktok.

As for me and many we stop giving western entertainment out money a long time ago. Some games here and there are worth it but most of my money and time goes to Asian entertainment and some indy stuff."	[]

The funny thing is, they could make it work if they just tweaked it a bit and had the courage to make the badass girl boss the villain. Hela is a great example. Strong, competent, intelligent, wins most of her fights. Made for a compelling movie, trying to find ways to defeat her. Or if you don‚Äôt want her to be O.P. like Hela another good example is Dedra in ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù. Smart, ambitious, and cunning, her masculine demeanor and her rivalry with her male counterparts worked. She‚Äôs an excellent character because while you are rooting against her while she is hunting the rebels you are rooting FOR her in her battles within the Empire hierarchy.	['Not really. Female leads that beat trained male fighters in one to one combat are always cringe because completely unrealistic.']

"I think the issue here goes further than the Drinker states here. The vast majority of girls actually like superhero movies actually like male characters. Many of them like the fantasy of a good looking heroic man, and often identify with the love interest who he saves. 

Making female led superhero movies doesn‚Äôt actually appeal to anyone, least of all female superhero fans."	[]

There's a male power fantasy behind superheroes.  Most women aren't into it.  Catering a male fantasy to women won't work, the foundation is unsound.  They know this, but are trying to change human nature again anyway.	[]

"The cabal of institutional investors that control markets and promote ESG are a large part of the of this picture. 

The big media and tech companies are so dominant and bloated they are often contemptuous of their actual consumers. They can be, as often we have little alternative to use them (eg if we want to access the content these bastards have bought up)‚Ä¶ and the more gargantuan a corporation becomes the more contempt they show to consumers and the more they spend time in a small bubble courting, placating and circle-jerking the wealthy corporate elites who hold dominion over the global market place. 

Add into that the ideological madness of woke that is the Borg of western countries and you have a recipe for a dreadful era of quasi-religious, corporate gruel. 

Its why they continue to ignore the voice of the man on the street and dismiss them as trolls and bigots. Eventually‚Ä¶ EVENTUALLY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a contempt for a consumer will be terminal to a business. The problem we have is it might take a decade or more for such big businesses to feel enough pain to suffer their own darwinian donwfall"	[]
I agree for the most part ,but I wouldn't include Ashoka in this shitlist. It`s one of the few new shows I actually like.	[]
"I think this is the first time I disagree with Critical Drinker. ""their approach"" does need to change radically to win back fans. Rings of Power needs to just never have happened. Move on, nothing to see here. Star Wars needs a complete rewrite after RotJ. I think I speak for most fans in that we cannot stand to look at their main characters and plot lines need to be erased to move forward with something that SW fans agree with. How the force works. The emperor. Etc. And bring friggin Luke back with a lead role. Everything else, as usual is spot on brother."	[]
It‚Äôs the end of the Box Office girl boss (although it was pretty much a flop to begin with). But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the end of girl bosses in tv/movies, not with the DEIA rules in place for screenwriters, and the types of screenwriters coming through the system. You can imagine a whole host of writers inspired by things like She Hulk, Rings of Power, Echo, etc.	[]

"This isn't really a problem about Girlsbosses but rather super hero movies in general being irrelevant right now. Shit simply peaked at endgame, and now there is no worth to it. From eternals, the justice league, to the marvels or whatever, people are simply no longer invested into Super hero movies anymore, if you compare movies with ""girlbosses"" and movies with male super hero protagonist, there isn't that much of a difference on success, they all suck; while stuff like Star wars are at the deep end of it already since that massive fuck up of sequels. 

People in general want to see something fun and decently written, it's the same reason why disney movies are flopping, while foreign cinema is getting popular. Hollywood as a whole is not making the cut."	[]

"It's one more example of 'the message' getting in the way of the story, and reality in general. Superhero movies are a male-oriented genre. And they should market it towards the target audience, instead of writing it for themselves for a self-congratulatory pat on the shoulder. ""Barbie"" is the prime example that a genre for females and marketed to them can turn out great for studios. The solution is to just write well-written, complex and believable characters. Or to put it even simpler, just write good characters. Men can identify with female protagonists (take Ripley and Sarah Connor for example). But the ""girl-boss"" is just a stock character that no one can take seriously anymore. Just make good movies."	[]

"I never thought I'd see the day when companies did literally everything they could to go against statistics, making money and generally appealing to audiences/customers. How do you see statistics of men liking action, super heroes and science fiction compared t woman and think ""Let's pander to woman, that will work!""

Just as strange is the reaction afterwards. Everything about these movies screams that it's more for woman.... but then blame men for not showing up when it flops. Sometimes after saying ""It's not for you""

We truly live in bizzarro world these days when it comes to hollywood. Men and woman, on a general level, have different interests. This is not some forbidden truth. Understand this and exploit it and the money and recognition will come. Instead of not just making badly targetted movies, but also having to take shots at men in the process somewhere in the movie. Yes I would love to pay my hard earned money to watch a movie that attempts to make my gender look like either pigs, or clueless bootlicking dumbasses with no in between.

Glad to see we might have some hope again. Maybe the people with all the money will finally fix this. Put some smart people back in charge of things and pull it all back together again."	[]
"They keep trying to assert this ridiculous feminist ""men and women are exactly the same"" argument.

Hollywood is dead, or at least in steep decline. You are much better off watching movies like Godzilla Minus One, The Boy and the Heron, and Anatomy of a Fall than risking a Hollywood film.

You have to remember that this has been driven by ideological belief. If you honestly believe that gender is a social construct then it really shouldn‚Äôt matter if you push different gender ideas into art. The problem is that the belief that gender is purely a social construct is the same level of willful ignorance as thinking the world is five thousand years old. And a large chunk of these people won‚Äôt give up this religious belief because it means that human beings have instincts based on gender and thus a perfectly equal society can never exist.	[]

Very well made message Drinker.  It is truly amazing to me how these morons thought that women love to see action and adventure and sci fi like us guys.

....whereupon an alien space ship blasted the picnic into smithereens....
 ....but luckily the girl had a anti-aircraft gun and successfully shot the spaceship down so that she could resume her picnic....

However, CEO's and Feminist woman swarm these worlds and try to tell the majority of the fan base that this isn't just for you (which is true) but needs to represent woman and minority's and instead of creating their own stuff they take over existing creations and try to twist and change it to make a minority of a minority happy.

It's funny that they make movies by, for, with and about specific demographics and demand that the audience adapt, yet they still add subtitles for Chinese (and other) audiences adapted to their cultural sensitivities.

Communists keep pushing this blank slate nonsense, and assume that gender preferences are entirely social constructs. But the data and plain common sense doesn't show that. Most women I know, regardless of background, like the same kinds of films and TV shows. They like romance, musicals, supernatural stuff, and Henry Cavill running around with his shirt off. Preferably a combination of all four. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Sure, there will be overlap. But prior to the 2010s, marketers intuitively understood what products appeal to which demos. Hollywood, along with the games and publishing industries, have spent untold billions trying to change this. Nobody has succeeded. They're just tilting at windmills at this point.	[]
"I'm might not be like ""other girls"" because I'm not extremly interested in romance. In fact I'm more into action, horror or psychological stories (Joker 2019, Breaking Bad, Berserk, Kaiji Ultimate Survivor) and just the idea of these stories that suddenly have a ""generic strong female character for female audience"" genuenly feels too off. Sure, the MCU have fangirls, but find me ONE fangirl who says ""Captain Marvel is my favourite character of the MCU"". There's basically none of them.

"Maverick was a slightly shiner turd than usual feminist DEI bullshit weve had to endure, but still a turd .Lets not let Maverick off the hook  so easily.

She spent half her screen time cracking her knuckles and rolling her eyes at the stereo typical alpha guy in the group, taking him down a notch with every interaction... then smiling at her black and hispanic team mates who were looking to her to lay the smack down on the ""straight white male'.    Lets also remember that 7 or 8 minute of screen time was devoted to Maverick being publicly humiliated by a ""strong female"" (single mother, sole proprietor, single handedly managing to raise a boy and run a bar).  Maverick just stood there looking sheepish, humiliated and shamed under her scornful glare as she brow beat, belittled, mocked and bullied him in front of everyone.

For decades since the dawn of TV, entertainment and corporations have had a holy alliance. You make shows, and we'll pay you to put our adds on them. And, in that partnership, was born the science of market research. Tons and tons of data on what appeals to who for the express purpose to ring every dollar out of every drop of time in TV and movies and maximize watchers. That's why there are no feminine hygiene product commercials on my A-Team, no Football commercials in my Lifetime show, and no toy commercials in the 11 PM horror movie of the week. It's down to a science....raw, unfiltered, unbiased observation. Men and women, young and old, we all have our trends. Then, one day, some morons decided, no, that's not how it should work. Lets turn it upside down. Then the ratings went down, the quality went down, and surprised Pikachu was born.	[]

"In recent years, we‚Äôve seen this popular argument about ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù on social media.  The argument is basically that there are apparently legions of women and girls who would dearly love to get into sci fi, action, fantasy and other entertainment genres but what puts them off is that they don‚Äôt see other women either watching it and/or starring in them, and this in turn means that women and girls don‚Äôt receive the kind of empowering message they need.

The problem is that this is completely untrue and the people making this argument are not *really* interested in this stuff.  They just wanted to get on their soapbox about something.

Warhammer 40,000 is a great example of this because there are absolutely loads of female characters and troops in it and anyone who was genuinely interested in the game would know that, yet the feminists focused solely on the ‚Äúlack‚Äù of female space marines as if they were the only faction because that was all they knew about it from a quick google search.

Hollywood failed to understand that the demand for ‚Äúgreater representation‚Äù was completely disingenuous, and this is why their attempts to cater for that demand did not translate into bums on cinema seats."	[]

If they just wanted to bring more women into scifi they would not have done what they did.  What they wanted was to change the men who like to watch it, and for that they got stomped on, and rightfully so.  When you hate your audience you should expect them to at least dislike you back.  If they added elements to interest women, including real female characters, without destroying the male ones, a lot of this could have been avoided and it likely would have worked.	[]

It's the *way* in which it has been done, however, that's idiotic. By pushing a narrative that doesn't just include females, but actively shits on males, they drove a larger audience away than they were adding. Right, rookie mistake, overshot a little. But  they *kept doing it*..."	[]

"['males actually really enjoy admirable, strong female characters with a great character arch and does this without degrading and demeaning males...\nLook at Ripley from Alien series for instance.  100% female, not trying to be male, there are strong male characters but she is the lead character....there are also incompetent and/or weak male and female characters.  ie. people with all of their strengths and flaws.

There are two kinds of women who watch traditional superhero movies: women who go with male partners, and women who like traditional male-centric superhero movies.  Neither of these groups will end up in a theater with a female-centric superhero movie.	[]
Its ironic. The very same people that acknowledge and pride themselves on their differences treat all their customers the same.	[]

The shame is that if they kept the female led films and media closer to their source material they legitimately could have had a chance.	[]
Hey dude FREE ASSANGE.	[]
"I would like to suggest- admittedly without hard data to back me up- that women are more likely to come along to movie genres outside of their gender norms with male colleagues, friends, or romantic partners, than the opposite. Talk about dragging a man to a musical, you have half of a joke already written. Women going to see ""Avengers""? Not so much. While the industry has failed to appreciate what women want in ""girlboss"" movies, there _is_ some small sense that a man going to a rom-com is emasculated, but woman going to a superhero movie is empowered."

The fact that the women creating these movies and shows openly admit to not consuming the content should have been a major red flag to the studios üòÇ	[]

Even in a fictional movie setting, a 120 lb woman beating the crap out of men that are 200 lb is just ridiculous. There's no reason why anyone would find that believable even in their imagination.	"['Many that say this believed Sarah Connor, Black Widow, Ana De Armas, etc. Many also believe it when old ass Liam Neeson beats up multiple guys lol', 'Only when done right. I still love Buffy to this day', 'In real life, bigger people get their shit rocked by smaller people all the time. You just need to know where to hit them. If a physically capable woman is taking out grown men in a well choreographed sequence, I got no issues with that. Harley Quinn obliterates a building of trained soldiers in James Gunn‚Äôs suicide squad. It‚Äôs a great sequence because the movie makes you believe she‚Äôs capable of it. And because she‚Äôs physically on a different level, she uses more melee weapons or objects around her to take them out. On then other hand, if the choreography is slow and clunky like in Echo where it looks like the men aren‚Äôt even putting up a fight, then that‚Äôs the issue', ""To fix this, there will be a 300lb female next, it'll also spread THE MESSAGE of fat acceptance"", ""@@Luke101 Agree, there's a lot of hypocrisy when it comes to this topic. Ethan Hunt is old as shit beating up multiple dudes isn't realistic either. Same with John Wick. Looks cool though for sure. Scarlett Johanson is like 5 3 and has no super serum in the MCU, she fought Robots, Aliens, and multiple big dudes at once in Civil War, flipping them over like nothing.  but it looked good for sure. she did get whooped by Winter Soldier at least. Don't get me started on Fast n Furious fights. lol""]"

"The thing about these 'girlboss' characters is that this was never what female audiences actually wanted in the first place. Sure, there are women who will watch these movies, because they don't have a choice and they've never seen anything better; but the truth is these so-called women empowering movies are not what female audiences desire. A bunch of rich white Hollywood executives just decided *for* women (and people of colour) that this what they wanted, without ever asking us or doing research. We're being gaslit by Hollywood.

If you were to ask, say, Kathleen Kennedy or the showrunners of Rings of Power, a question about strong female characters, my gosh they'd repeat the same old talking points and talk for hours if you let them. But if you ask them (or anyone in Hollywood) what is one specific thing or character type that female Star Wars fans wanted, or female Tolkien fans wanted, they would not be able to answer. They simply do not care. The paradox that no one seems to mention is that the people who make these movies for women do not actually know or care what female audiences want.

I've no doubt that if any of the shows and films you mentioned actually catered to female audiences, they'd be critical and commercial successes, with both female and male audiences."	[]
"I tried watching The Marvels. Completely removed any bias. I seriously could not make it past the first fight scene. 

It was so incredibly awful and stupid. The choreography didn't make any sense and how did these women know how to fight? There's no setup at all. It's just, here you go. The element of comedy added in was also distracting. I don't know who is the target audience at all."	[]
With all of the outlets on cable, streaming, movie theaters, we see that there are probably enough talented people to go on screen. What is lacking are writers, directors, and show runners with a clue or executives with the business and creative savvy to identify those people as well as the projects they should be working on. Until a Feige or Iger or Kennedy loses a job or they accidentally stumble upon the next big thing (think Iron Man) this muddled morass will continue.	[]

"You, and your crew that you do after hours with, should write up a script for a season of a novel super-hero-esque type of series, start a low-budget production company - use a Kickstarter campaign if needed - and produce a YouTube series.  8-10 episodes.  Completely control the narrative, cast, etc.  

I'd watch it.  'F' Hollywood.  ""Vader - Episode 1"" was better than the horrible so-called ""Star Wars"" sequels.  And the ""Uncharted"" short on YouTube with Nathan Fillion was 10x better than the horrible ""Uncharted"" movie.  

I bet you'd beat the pants off half the worthless dribble that studios are producing today.  Collectively, you guys have more power, viewers, and influence than they do.

Use it.  I bet you'd make a killing...not just on views, but I bet if successful you could parley it into movies and such."	[]
I will push back a little and say if you have a good story, you can attract a wider demographic without alienating the core. A good and bad example is Wonder Woman, which had an engaging story and that would have hit bigger if the final act  paid off the theme better.	[]

I don¬¥t mind the genre; really, I don¬¥t, except for slasher/horror-flics wich I usually don¬¥t like. We watched together ""Reacher"" and celebrated it, for example. We enjoyed ""Top Gun: Maverick"" together. Good romantic movies are rare these days but ""Notting Hill"", ""Pretty Woman""? Bring it on!

And that (!) is the key problem: Don¬¥t look for your audience, just make great movies, and they¬¥ll find their audience."	[]

The sad thing is, the more Hollywood tries to force these tropes in movies, the more it seems to empower man-o-sphere douche bags like Andrew Tate by giving them a perceived cause and a ‚Äòboogyman‚Äô to rally against. Then the studios see all that overreaction nonsense by weeping man babies and double down on more schlock that progressively gets worse with each iteration. It becomes a positive feedback loop with each side strengthening the resolve of the very thing they‚Äôre pushing back against. Let the culture war end already.	[]
Hollywood gets it, they know their formula is not working. But they're in the grip of Black Rock, vanguard, and sweet baby. They have no choice.	[]
L‚Äôm a straight man, and I just like a good movie, male or female lead, like B 9:16  I genuinely wanted to see that film in theaters. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt, because it was a bit of a disappointment when I actually did. That whole peach by Ferrera, and the events that followed just tanked it.

"I hope so, maybe we can get back to a time when female characters  were actually allowed to presented as complex, multifaceted individuals that came in different shapes & sizes.

Individuals who possessed personalities, flaws, the capacity for struggle & even failure; people go beyond being a boring, bland, emotionless, vacuous shell of person, who believes the world revolves around them due to their innate awesomeness.

Individuals who have to actually grow, learn & overcome difficult obstacle by relying upon others or reconsider pre conceived notions about reality & themselves.

Individuals that are able to stand on their own two feet, not as God, but as an imperfect humans alongside their male counterparts.

No matter how strong, powerful, experienced, charismatic, or  beautiful it is imperative that they must remain FALLIBLE"	['lets bring them back by ourselves.']

making all women girl bosses is actually backfiring heavily . as a 17 year old male, I hate most of this girlboss shit , it's so empty inside, and it's just destroying all of my favorite franchises , not because I hate women but because I hate one dimensional empty soulless cringe characters	[]
"I don‚Äôt mind the whole girl boss thing but the movies they pour into the market is just shallow, boring and, most importantly, not fun.  If they made something entertaining using the message, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded at all; these movies just don‚Äôt have a proper story or a spectacle, which one expects from one.

Sort of...Men fantasize about beating men and winning the approval of a woman.  This is an inconvenient truth, but a truth none-the-less.  But an even more inconvenient truth is that women know what men fantasize about, and are largely ok with it, even encourage it, though they don't much like getting beat on or controlled.  The girlboss trope is too much of the latter truth and not enough of the former.	[]

"Some of the strongest male characters have their breakdown moment. Take Rambo First Blood, some girls were watching it (YouTube) and they started to cry at the end when John broke down, a man hated by the society he was protecting, lost friend, everything. Or the male character will get beaten badly, learns from it, and wins in the end.
Now here comes the Girl-Boss. Every Girl-Boss looks like somebody they picked up randomly during the winter from a mall (Not very special) Of course the Girl-Boss is strong and the only thing they have to do is convince everyone to accept how strong she it, the end. When you throw an egg at the wall, and if this egg's a Girl-Boss, the egg will beat the wall."	[]

"It's honestly become a more common and tired troupe in modern cinema than the ""Muscled action hero Chad"".

Problem is that this would also mean accepting either gender difference isn‚Äôt artificial and a result of social conditioning, or that it is - and therefore becoming what they see as ‚Äòpart of the problem‚Äô. To a zealot - and I think we can agree that there are a number of zealots on both sides of most disagreements about anything - aren‚Äôt going to be able to do that, even if the money tells them they have to. And I suspect the zealots are very highly placed in the studio system, and I suspect they probably have Harvey dirt on everyone. (Plus Blackrock et al actually like all the social unrest it‚Äôs caused for the last 8 or 9 years, it takes attention away from the fact they‚Äôre buying up all the residential stock in the country, or something equally sinister.

Let them keep going into debt for all the movies they make, personally I like that, they charge too much money to shove feminism and multiple genders down our throats.	[]
The whole girl boss marketing strategy was built on top of a female tenancy to try and force guys to like their crap. Male entertainment is fun. Female entertainment is scatterbrained and awful. Girl boss super-heroes are villains that blame everyone and take zero accountability. The result of the great experiment is a warning to women: grow up or grow old.	[]

The only reason it is stopping the 'Girlboss' route, or at least slowing it down, is NOT because they don't believe in it anymore - it's just not making enough money for it to be feasible. Otherwise, we would never hear the end of it, and even then I don't think it will die a well-deserved death. The woke group will find a way to limp on.	[]

Scarlet Witch and Black Widow were the only female leads from the MCU I thoroughly enjoyed and wanted to see more of! They should‚Äôve been the face for women EVERYWHERE.

The best thing of the girl boss era, for me personally, was to stop watching films and gaming.

What‚Äôs sad is that Hollywood tries to get the ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù to be a role model. The reality of these boring girl bosses is that they spend their youth full of arrogance(acting like they don‚Äôt need a man) but later on, they regret their actions(buy 7 cats or dogs) and want a family.	[]

I had a conversation with my mom a couple years before she passed and she was telling me how she enjoyed that movie Bridesmaids but she didn't recommend it to me because in her words: ""It's a chick flick and you probably won't like it"". And modern audiences need to realize that: A genre can appeal MAINLY to MEN and another genre can appeal MAINLY to WOMEN. My mom also enjoyed the two Terminator movies but it was my dad who took my brother and I to see it back in '92 because it was this guy thing, AND THAT'S OK SNOWFLAKES!"	[]

Trying to make or cater anything to MALES is considered a crime nowadays. Someone, somewhere, somehow will always get sensitive about it. We've gone from women's emancipation and rights to the far far (very far) other end of the spectrum which is the extreme now being force fed through movies.	[]
Well done, sir.	[]
I would have gone to watch The Marvels, but i was too busy thinking about the Roman Empire.	[]

They hire the wrong women for these types of jobs (writer, director, show runner, etc)  because majority of women are shit at these types of jobs.   On top of that, they have limited experience and a track record of crappy films they work on.   The Barbie movie did well because, well it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Barbie.  Not because it was a good movie.  The movie was stupid AF and annoying, but just like Black Panther it was pushed to this amazing ground breaking female film.  ü§Æ There, I said it!And you know that‚Äôs the truth, Drinker."	[]

The wokeness continued worse than ever, in fact the woman in charge of the GOT cancelled woke prequel came back...to direct Madam Web.

For the most part, the actresses are unlikable and the characters even more so! They are pushing gender swaps for genres that do not call for them. So they blame the audiences for their failures, which in the entertainment industry is a HUGE mistake! I have no issues with strong female characters, but when the men are belittled and shit on, I will not tolerate it!! I saw where Marvel was going when towards the end of Endgame, the female superhero photo op happened, and I did not like it. Never saw that movie or any other Marvel movie since then! They no longer appeal to me!!	[]

Despite femenism and empowerment bs there are lot of women who are dependent on men to take them to dinners and movies , so even the 40% female audience half of them aren't there on their own.

As a society, we've become so wealthy that we've shifted from a meritocracy to an aristocracy investing in luxury beliefs. Unfortunately, they tried to apply that to writing movies, where the meritocracy still rules.

If films for women need only women, why don't films for men feature only men? Oh that's right, they want to see hot members of the opposite sex too.

Funny irony, if they had put someone like Joss Whedon in charge of The Marvels or Madame Web, he would have made a better movie.

I never thought she was being serious. That is who took over, the chicks who hated everything the guys put their time and money into."	[]
"Hey drinker, it's your Canadian buddy, Scott coming at you from Toronto. As a Canadian, I am required by law to watch and play hockey, so I do my civic duty.

Why am I telling you this? It's because almost every year we have the same discussion up here about women's hockey. Why isn't it more popular? Why aren't more people going? Why can't the women hockey players earn a living from playing hockey, etc. etc. etc. 

Occasionally some moron brings up the equal pay for equal work argument, but we ignore stupidity...

The reason why women's hockey is not popular or self-sustaining, is because men are the primary viewers of professional sports. Period. Not women, men.

If men decide to watch professional sports, they will probably watch men's sports because they are men, and because it is generally the pinnacle of human competition. There are some exceptions where women's sports can be popular, like tennis, golf, gymnastics and a whole host of others, but I'm not sure those are the same as women trying to play hockey, football, basketball, baseball, etc., which are much more taxing and dangerous than the aforementioned.

I was watching a YouTube show or a television program with a debate about this very topic and one of the men, I mean toxic males, on the panel asked all of the women to name their top three professional women's hockey players. 

As you can imagine, not only did they not know any of the players, only one of them could name a team in the women's professional hockey League. 

Hilarity ensued..."	[]

"The ""girlboss"" is just a new name for Mary Sue. I miss the times when characters like Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor were the protagonists.

Point two being ,why do they even fund these despite seeing losses since long? . 
Why do they spoile franchises instead of writing and creating new ones for the female characters."	[]

"now, imho, you CAN make a movie most audiences will enjoy... and can mix sci-fi and rom/rom-com/etc elements easy enough... and have it work well... it just takes somebody whos not working off an ideology whos goal is creating good content not pushing an agenda....

one thing my mother said about for example The Fifth Element was that she always liked the movie despite not being very into sci-fi because the interactions between the MC's were so good, and when she realized zorg was oldman... well... shes always blown away how he can chameleon so well...

now she isnt anti-sci-fi... her dad was a trek fan and she did carry on the family watching tng long after grandad died(i can remember him but not all that clearly i was very young when he died but i do remember watching trek from his knee... and him commenting about the show, actors, guest stars, etc.. ) 

but... she admits alot of why she likes some of the same movies i do, is they have some elements that bring in generas she likes, romance, drama, romcom, and detectivy stuff... its also why she has liked some shows i recommended despite not thinking she would... deadwood... thats a show that everybody i know eventually came to love.. even a buddies very devout xian mom during cv19 hurt her knee and as she was running out of shit to binge and was on pain killers.. she started watching... 1.5seasons in the womans using the shows catchphrase...and watching with 3 of her church friends who had trouble getting past the lang but once they did... ""its really good"" as one told us on voice chat... 

on the other hand there are shows/movies that only tomboy geek girls seem to be that into(i mean along side men/boys/guys), and, there are a shitload of movies specifically targeting women knowing men are going to be a very very very small % of the audience mostly coming with women... 

oh the other hand again... i think most guys can admit they have seen at least one romance/comedy/drama that was mostly outside our wheel house, but was actually really good... hell...i have seen a few that were mostly drama/romance but set in a sci-fi or fantasy backdrop that was well written/thought out enough that... it had me wanting more content from that universe more targeted at my tastes that went more in dept on the tech and such.."

Girl bosses are basically... well... at their basic form... nothing more than 'aunts' but... minus the letter 'a' and replace it with another appropriate consonant. At least that's the word that comes to my mind whenever I see a film and TV critic repost the Galadriel chipmunk-miffed-face or 'there is a tempest in me' scene.

The other (even more unspeakable) dichotomy is movies aimed at or pandering to proposed black / brown vs pre-existing painfully-white audiences ‚Ä¶ most viewers want to see a hero that ‚Äòlooks like them‚Äô and race-swapping long-standing characters is a complete no-no (if the role properly establishes itself as either black or white then it should stay in lane and not annoy fans of the character ‚Ä¶ looking at you Dr Who and many other reimagined characters).

Personally I'm sick of the programming.  It seems every Hollywood movie is making out out that the villain or the dope is always a white man.  I'm not particularly thin skinned, but it is a tired racist, misandrist trope, repeated ad nauseum and it has just programmed society to always see white men as either evil or easy targets.  So I am not really interested in consuming such programming.  I'm a white man, and I am not evil nor a dope.  I just want to be a good human being and enjoy quality stories.  I hate seeing the world through race and gender lenses.	[]

Regardless of their military training and their purpose, they maintained a feminine quality that lasted right up to their deaths.  Ironically, with a movie of all female leads, the feminists all but ignored the move because it didn't pander to many of the checkmarks demanded of from a modern mindset.  At it's core, you had a woman, trying to rescue her husband.  Apparently that is a bridge that feminists refuse to cross.	[]

"The Death Of The Girlboss in the movies & sitcoms?

The girl boss phenomenon is hilarious but it's also dangerous. Women these days watch this garbage and actually believe that they can fight off a man. I'm a 58 year year old former Marine and I will gladly fight the UFC women's champion in ANY weight class. They will all literally die of a broken neck in mere seconds. The few times you DO see women last a few rounds, it's because the men are holding back or because the fight has a referee that is protecting the woman. In an outright street fight, the woman dies every time, even to an average man.	[]
"Yeah, they aren't making this stuff for ""women"", they're making it for what 3rd wave female they/thems think women want. You don't see conservative women filling up those Hollywood script writer positions now, do you? Nope. It's all the liberal, single rainbow body positives that are in there.
If it was made for me, there would be a Hot Male Costar. Every. Time.
Mila Jovovich in Resident Evil had TWO Hot Male Costars. In every film in that series afterwards, while ridiculously over the top, there were ALWAYS Hot Guys on screen with her.
Magic Mike was made for me.
Jane Erye was made for me. 
Hell, any action movie where the Hot Male Star takes his shirt off was MADE FOR ME. 
A bunch of middling attractive females in dumpy clothes running around Doing Stuff, like Madame Web? No thanks. YOUR VILLIAN WASN'T EVEN HOT. Why should I bother to go?
Even Buffy the Vampire Slayer understood this!!

"Lego toys did a study that found that children play and use imagination differently.  
Boys pretend that they are the action figures they play with.  Girls pretend that the action figures are themselves.

I am fine with the defamation for not watching these movies, is not made for me nor my wallet. Studios need these strategies to get ESG money from pensioners, funneled by BlackRock and Vanguard.

This girlboss nonesense still happens in action movies, by the way. And has been going on since before the movie/comic book craze. Just sayin'. It's going to be a while, if ever.	[]
Hollywood forgot how to make compelling strong female characters.

For such a long time, the film studios have seen their companies on fire, but their plan for putting out the fire is to keep pouring oil on it.

This is the reason why Japanese manga and anime are so successful, because Japanese creators recognize that men and women have different preferences, and thus, they have genres in place for that purpose. Shonen features bombastic fight scenes, male-oriented conflict, and of course, cute and sexy girls. Shojo, on the other hand, features a lot of romance, near kisses, female-oriented conflict and, of course, handsome boys.	['Gonna have an issue there culturally now-a-days in the western writers guilds.

I compare this to the issues the WNBA is facing. They're not profitable at all. In fact, the NBA helps to fund them every year. Instead of the WNBA focusing on growing their brand and putting on exciting basketball, it seems a lot of the players just want to complain about the inequalities and that they should be getting paid the same amount of money as the men. They try to cater to a female audience but a lot of those female fans would rather watch the NBA because it's exciting.	[]

I want to say that the fact they removed sexualised content aimed at men from almost all media is part of why I no longer engage with it. We all want different things but I want fast paced action, hot women, strong leads, and that sort of thing.

"Re: ""You're not gonna get equal numbers of women to watch science fiction or action or super hero movies, just like you're not gonna get equal numbers of men to watch romance flicks or musicals."" 

I‚Äôm not sure that is always true. I do agree that you are never going to achieve either of those aims by shallow pandering to your audience. But a good story with real artistic merit can appeal to both men and women in a big way.

Maybe my experience was an anomaly, but I remember when THE TERMINATOR came out in 1984. Here was a science fiction action movie with car chases and gunfights and a killer robot. But it was also THE ‚Äúdate night‚Äù movie of the year. I remember my friends‚Äô older sisters and my babysitters enthusiastically going to see THE TERMINATOR not just once but over and over and over again. THE TERMINATOR had a huge female audience even though it had the car chases and guns and killer robots. It also had relatable relationships, comedy, working class woes, romance, and one of the all-time great heroines in Sarah Connor. Women loved that movie, and guys loved it too. 

Was that an anomaly?

I don‚Äôt think so, because I sure watched all THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies in theaters with a lot of women attending --- and it wasn‚Äôt always just the ladies wiping away tears in certain scenes. 

And as a guy, I admit I never get tired of watching WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, and Greta Gerwig‚Äôs LITTLE WOMEN was one of the best films of 2019."	[]

"I think Elliot Silverstein's 1965 comic Western CAT BALLOU, with Jane Fonda in her absolute prime, is the best fundamental ""Heroine's Journey"" film I've ever seen. She literally goes step-by-step through every element of archetype: Naive innocent ""ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder; fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won; the heroine comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on humanity."" Lee Marvin's great in it too; won the Best Actor Oscar for that year (though, honestly, Richard Burton or Rod Steiger probably deserved it more for THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD and THE PAWNBROKER, respectively)."

And as you pointed out, men (who are the ones that watch these movies) don't want to watch that! You want a female led superhero movie that would actually make money? Put Sydney Sweeney's character from Madame Web, get her into the skin tight costume at least 1/3 into the movie and just let it fly. We don't need the whining about ""patriarchy"" and all that.

My 4 favorite franchises that have been completely destroyed and turned into a caricature of themselves, destroying any chance of a LOT of fans of said franchises to come back to them. The damage has been done and I don't see that changing any time soon. They're all almost at a point of requiring a complete reboot. And I don't mean one so a new actor can have a career.

I mean a 100% complete rebuild, like tearing down a car to the frame and restoring and reworking every single little piece until you end up with something that barely resembles the original in anything but name. All the while keeping the basic idea and original style of storytelling.

I know that all sounds contradictory, but ""a fresh start"" is how many people rebuild their lives into something they can not only live with, but also enjoy. It's also the formula for the failures we've seen, but all that was due to poor implementation and execution."	[]

"Not sure if it's even men tastes vs women tastes. I'll use a Sean Lock gag as a parable: so he catches his wife trying to buy him a beehive. So he grabs the phone, shouts at the guy at the other and that he needs no bee hive. So his wife is like, ""but you kept going on about how bees are dying, and we're all doomed if they do, and so on."" And he's like, ""you don't understand. I just like to moan.""

It seems to me like it perfectly illustrates what's been happening here. A whole bunch of people just liked to moan. Preferably about the same thing as their circle-jerk group on Twitter was moaning about, so they could all give each other a thumbs up, retreat, and a reach-around. But that was it. They never were interested in buying a ticket no matter what you do. They just wanted to join in some popular moan.

It's like idiot dogs barking their lungs out at the Amazon delivery guy, and reassuring each other that yeah, verily, they showed that nazi delivery guy what's what. Probably saved the world for another day, even. Some of them hadn't even been on the other side of the door to actually know what the delivery guy is doing or even what he looks like. But the other clueless puppies are barking about it, and you wouldn't want to be left out, amirite? But trying to cater to those instead is futile. They're not going to actually buy anything. All they physically can do is bark.

And that's really what they did here. They didn't really cater to men, women, blacks, muslims, or anything. In fact, they actually went against what some of those groups were explicitly saying they like or dislike. They just tried to model their business around catering to the demented barking puppies."	[]

I will never go back to superhero movies. They did me a favor by killing the medium in some way. I enjoyed superheroes as a child and when the MCU started with Iron Man I was in my early teens. If they stayed true that emotional connection would have stayed with me through adult hood, but due to the timing they have severed that connection that was marketed to me in adolescence. It is a lot easier to market to children, Disney has basically killed the fan-base that they inherited when buying Marvel and I don't think they will be able to recover the majority of them that aren't brain dead or special needs in a perpetual child like state.

This is one of the better takes from the Critical Drinker.	[]
The stupid thing is before 2016 nobody really cared what gender the main character was. Its only cause Hollywood kept pushing this strong female character agenda when we realized that was code for this movie is probably gonna suck cause they have no talent for writing but will blame guys for not supporting their trash product.	[]
The funny thing is my wife, daughter, and their friends all loved the main Marvel run (with sexy ripped men) as much as my sons and I did.  Because the focus was on diversity of Story, not agenda.  I remember my wife crying when Iron man and Cap fought in Civil War in the end, it killed her.  But she doesn't like this new Mary Sue crap any more than the men do.	[]

I hate how the creator of the video is constantly preaching that just because something is diverse its going to flop. No, those movies flopped because they were badly written and solely relied on the diversity of the cast or story. Superhero and action shows or movies can be very diverse and still be great. WandaVision was awesome despite having a female main character and a female main villain and everyone regardless of gender loved it because the goal was to make an awesome story that everyone can relate to and not some garbage that was made with absolutely no effort, the creators of which then rely solely on specific groups of audience to carry with their money or views like Madame Web.

"The type of person who makes you feel bad about yourself is called an abuser.   It's a classic trait of the malignant narcissist.  To make you doubt your own worth, and feel bad for who you are.

Remember guys, you're not the ones in the wrong for liking particular shows, nor are you in the wrong for simply being male.   And keep in mind that those who seek to make you feel this way, are the ones with the issues, they are the people who feel the need to control others, because they are lacking within themselves.  They need to make you feel bad about yourself, so they can feel good about themselves.  They need to put you down, below them, as they are incapable of raising themselves up to your level. 

Do not hate them, but pity them instead.  Do not raise to their bait, as that is how they lure you in.  The best response to give a narcissist, is no response at all.  It will drive them wild, and they will explode with rage and fury, and reveal to the world just who they truly are.  Damaged individuals with major insecurities and terrible self esteem.  

Do not think you can cure these people, because you can't.  Only they can, that is the essence of self esteem.  Do not allow them to take yours because they don't have any.   

Do not try and teach them the error of their ways.  Do not engage.  Ignore and retreat, and you will win every battle with them.   Engage, and you play on their terms, and they will win.  

Consider this.  

If a man and a woman are having an argument in a cafe, and the woman starts crying, everyone will think the man a b'stard. 
If a man and a woman are having an argument in a cafe, and the man starts crying, everyone will think he is weak af.

Case in point, Godzilla Minus One. There's a masterclass in showing how a film with a budget of next to nothing compared to Hollywood blockbusters, does the absolute most with the absolute least.

"Okay this is completely off topic but.... Why don't studios make their stars watch the movie before it's released? It's absolutely embarrassing to have a star who has not seen the movie at all. If I were making a movie I would make them all sit down and watch the freaking movie before it was released. You're going to know what movie you were in before you talk about it. Dakota Johnson said we'd see it twice just cuz she thinks she's hot not because the movie is good. How the hell would she know? She hasn't seen it!

Also if you're going to have a movie be set in 2003 maybe actually have the actresses dress the way we dressed in 2003. 2003 was the era of the spaghetti strap tank top hip hugger jeans bare midrift and cleavage! None of that is shown in the wardrobe in this movie. Dakota has her shirt buttoned all the way to the top! And Sydney Sweeney is wearing a Jackie o top. The only reason people put her in things is because of her assets. That girl should have been wearing a spaghetti strap tank top and hip hugger jeans bringing all the boys to the yard!"	[]
"""The wheels of the gods turn slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine."" Nice analysis, Drinker."	[]
"I've been a Western media geek and an anime nerd since I was in middle school.  

I think in addition to the storytelling and characters in manga being better done, manga has always managed to create stories in every type of genre for men and women by STICKING to what naturally appeals to and resonates with men or women.  

You have the magical girl genre, which is basically superhero films MADE FOR GIRLS.  They feature superhero themes but the style, problems, themes, and plotlines are what appeal more to women.  A lot of them have high-stakes melodrama and romance at the core of their plots.  Sailor Moon is a key example.  

Conversely, they are able to market basically romances to men through the ""harem genre,"" because it leans into a male protagonist's fantasy of being surrounded by a lot of women who want to date him, but dealing with guy issues like growing up to be the better man to protect the women or save the world.

And of course everything else in between genre-wise usually has better chance of appealing to men and women because the men and women are written to have character traits and concerns that are coherent to most men and women.  Japan has even been progressive with characters possessing gender atypical traits, or being queer in some way, etc., and it never felt preachy or even fake because they were relatable characters in the story.

Western media could have adopted Japan's approach to make genres appeal to the opposite gender, but it didn't, and it becomes clear that a large reason for this is because of financial/find the lowest common denominator impulses, but moreso because ideology is trying to tell us there is no difference socially, mentally, or sometimes biologically between men and women.  (Combined with the fact women are pressuring other women to not like ""stereotypical women things"" anymore.)  

The entertainment industry has conducted a massive social engineering experiment on gender roles and it actually generated more data indicative that the sexes are different, not that they are as similar as they say.  Are there outliers?  Of course.  Should they be discriminated against?  No.  But do they represent 95% of the population?  No."	[]

"The thing is, women actually enjoyed all those franchises beforehand!  Star Trek has had an impact on women way back in the 60s (ask Whoopi Goldberg), She-Ra came about when Mattel heard that little girls were playing with their brothers' He-Man dolls, and little girls tucked magnifying glasses in their purses to solve mysteries like Nancy Drew.  What about these characters that have been so inspirational and encouraging for decades has made them so repulsive that they have to be ""reimagined"" now?  Main character of Alien series - a woman.  Main character of Terminator - a woman.  Main character of Voyager - a woman.  Sanctuary, Fringe, X-Files, Xena, Buffy... What about all these females who have inspired little girls for so many years has suddenly become insufficent?"	[]

"That's the biggest problem. This isn't setup to appeal to the female audience. They were using a poorly made male product and specifically ostracizing the male audience. 

If you want to appeal to the female audience, you need to look at Aquaman and Twilight. Aquaman sold itself on eye candy for women. Twilight appealed to the desire to be desired by everyone without a reason for it.

"I don‚Äôt think it will be easy to fix the issue. Too many people involved and not only the writers, but the producers and even the executives have been in this nonsensical fight for making cool the same character: obnoxious girl that saves the day by kicking and outsmarting guys 30 times his size. It was in the Rings of Power, in Birds of Prey, in Echo, and almost every single product generated from any big studio. 

Clean the floor will suppose to fire a lot, and I mean a lot of people with deranged ideas that cannot create anything with quality but just propaganda. And recover the trust of the audience will take at least another 5 years of good work. I don‚Äôt see that happening. It‚Äôs most probable that they will continue generating bullcrap regardless it will flop, like they have been doing for so long."	[]
"I think the problem isn't that the movies are ""made for women when women don't even watch those movies"", because even though they are the minority, women who like action movies are REAL and even they hated Madame Web and The Marvels.

The problem is that no matter your gender, these movies just SUCK. They are badly written, badly acted, badly filmed and badly directed. Even if the whole cast of The Marvels and Madame Web was changed to male and the ""pandering"" changed towards male audiences they would STILL suck. Thats the simple truth.

In order to get women to go to these types of franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC, etc), you first have to make the men happy.

Women didn't start getting into Marvel until it was already blowing up. And it was blowing up because they were satisfying the fans.
Same with Star Wars.

You conclusion is wrong Drinker. We don't want to see women empowerment anymore. Good written or not, we don't care. We want good old manly heroes and sexy women in distress to be saved by men.	[]
"There is nothing wrong with a female lead in a genre that is typically male, as long as the character is written well. I'm thinking of the old John Wayne flick, ""True Grit"" where a stubborn fiesty teenage girl hires John Wayne to help avenge her father. It is a great film that shows real character development as the movie goes along. 

What we have today are these ""girl boss bi-ch"" films where they are Mary Sues with no character development, no real struggles because they are already better than the men. But what is worse, there is this need to depict the ""good"" men as dumb, sexist, arrogant, etc. and the women need to show them up. I don't want to see a film where the main theme of the film is ""women good, men bad"" in all circumstances. They modern girl boss films are more sexist than any era and genre I can think of. At least the 1950's action movies showed women that were capable of running a home, even if they were complete failures in protecting themselves from the bad guy."	[]

"January 1st, 2025. That's my cut off date. During the Pandemic I set that for myself. Said if companies as big and grand as Disney and Marvel can't figure out how to make good movies again I cut the strings on everything. Not another ticket stub (not like I've bought any recently) not another DVD/Blu-Ray purchase, not another penny spent on streaming services.

This isn't some mutually assured destruction either. In the last 5 years I've begun reading novels again. Each year that passes I read more than the last. (Did you know Drinker has a book out? It's pretty good too). There are plenty of free streaming services out there to let you consume some kind of media even if it is dated and here on Youtube more and more fans are taking the Thanos path and saying ""fine I'll do it myself"" and their content is bloating by the day. Getting better and better.

The reason Hollywood got like this is because we let them believe entertainment can only come from them. Ultimate power corrupts ultimately and this is no exception."	[]

apropos to this video, my wife recently informed me that she thought it might be a fun double date for us to join another couple at our local dinner theatre's production of the musical /comedy performance of Top Gun Maverick.

It just makes absolutely no sense. There's a large number of women who love action and superhero movies AS THEY WERE. I loved the Infinity Saga. My dog is named Indy. My top ten favorite movies include Gladiator, LOTR, Die Hard, and Tombstone. There are others like me who miss GOOD MOVIES. But in trying to reach an audience they're likely never going to reach, they've lost the one they have. It's like letting go of your balloon to try to catch a bird; now they're empty handed. I hope they wake up and start making movies for their audience again soon.	[]

If nothing else, I've been saving a lot of time and money over the past 10 years skipping these movies and shows.  Mostly.  I'll still go see some of these movies (like Capt.

C.D. you missed a point about women, and that is we like to watch action movies with men being strong, heroic, and self sacrificing.

Someone's finally saying it:  Boy stuff should be made by boys for boys.  Get over it, world.	[]
I think part of this started with nerd culture becoming popular. And in turn female nerd attendance. Video games, comics, superheroes became popular instead of something the vast majority of people rolled their eyes and stuffed a kid in a locker. It became mainstream. It also opened the door for a lot of female nerd fans to get involved. Comicon was no longer a solely male event. Nerd culture became less dorky sweaty horny neckbeards in their parents basement and more everyday people. When I was younger female friends wouldn't dare join a group for DnD, and for good reason imo. Now, it's commonplace. I think studios tried targeting this group, but failed to understand while yes, its a growing demographic, its still a small minority compared to the male demographic. And many from this demographic don't need hollywood to cater to them as they are quite content making their own fan fictions from male targeted films.	[]
This needs to be shared and distributed as far and wide as possible. For the love of cinema and ‚ÄúTatiana‚Äù!	[]
It's fine to have badass female leads in male genres -- so long as they're not girlbosses. Instead of being repulsive, they should be on a hero's journey towards being sexy, confident, competent, and appropriately vulnerable. If not that, then at least play up actual mythological female archetypes, like Aliens does with Ripley and motherhood.	[]

Hot take, but I think the heads of Disney hate women. The ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù archetype is a lowbrow virtue signaling tool designed to bamboozle female audiences into consuming their mediocre products. If the Disney executives had any respect for female intelligence they would understand that such a shallow ploy would be dead on arrival. Our mom‚Äôs wives and daughters deserve much better than what Disney has on offer.	[]
The problem is not really the girlboss movies, is that the characters in general lack any kind of personality or personal development and spend the whole movie with blatant propaganda indoctrination in every movie. You can check some recent Korean movies with badass female leads and you will see that it is not the issue, unfortunately Hollywood fucked the whole idea in recent years, so I'm not expecting any good movies with that idea in the future from western movies, I just watch Asian ones lol	[]
Whats fascinating is that they surgically remove any kind of romance from everything thats meant to appeal to women, which is what women tend to enjoy.	[]
It has nothing to do with making things for women. These god-shit movies are not made for women. SW, DW, LOTR, whatever, were for everybody and now they are for nothing due to their horrendous scripts and characters. That's all.	[]
Hollywood's take from this video: so we should make rom-coms and musicals for men! Brilliant!	[]

It's the same thing as women's sports; they get mad that men aren't watching it when they themselves are not watching it.	[]

the problem with the girlboss trope is that men obviously don't like it, and women mostly don't either... women don't like being the boss.  they only do it if they HAVE to in most cases.  one thing women especially hate is OTHER women being bosses... when polled they said they would rather have a male boss.  and they are never good friends, most women i know prefer male friends almost exclusively	[]

white man bad..	[]
An astute analysis of the situation. I don't necessarily agree with everything, but indeed studios bending over backwards trying to capture female audiences while ignoring even some basic facts has always felt weird. Just gender swapping stereotypes was never going to work and the real tragedy in this is that the female teams behind many of those movies didn't get it, either. One would have hoped that at some point their feminine sensibilities would have kicked in and told them how wrong it all was...	[]
As a woman part of the reason I used to love the MCU was BECAUSE of the strong heroic male characters üòÇ and the female characters in the MCU were always great; I always loved Natasha, gamora, nebula, Wanda.

Yes good	[]
Sad part is many women decided to emulate the girl boss and found that being emotionally numb, focusing solely on your career or the like and generally being unpleasant typically results in you being miserable.	['Yes, but its the same for men btw. Even though there are more male characters in movies that are portrayed as lone, cold wolfes and they appear appealing/cool at first, their stories usually go down a dark road too when they dont change a bit. People who seek superficial things only and are purely driven by ego and desire for pleasure, will always hit a dead end...no matter if its men or women.']

"What baffles me is that Hollywood basically attempted to prove that women, people of color etc can be as good at making movies/acting as white men (something that was doubted by hardly anybody to begin with but okay). So they shoehorned women and people of color into positions of directors, lead actors etc and subsequently produced a ton of awful movies, idiotic writing, horrible acting, and soulless forgettable content which most people either disliked or just didn't care about. When this cycle inevitably ends, all they'll have accomplished is incidentally prove that a lot of actors/directors/writers from these demographics truly suck at their job. Ironically, due to them constantly bringing up race and gender I now automatically have less trust in movies directed by ethnic groups and/or with female lead actors - a notion that never crossed my mind BEFORE they attempted to ""empower"" these people. I've never thought of looking up the race and gender of people behind the movie (who cares?) and we all loved Ripley, Blade, and a whole lot of other characters who weren't white men. It's just so dumb."	[]

[]
Main problem with girl boss movies for me is that they always just feel really mean spirited. Like their goal isn't to inspire young girls/women but to shame, emasculate, and/or demean men. Even just the trailers for these movies will have at least one or two lines putting down men. Also they just constantly cram in as much left wing messaging as they can instead of just making a fun story with fun characters.	[]

The Neagley character in Reacher is an great example of a great female character, she can kick ass with the best, 'humiliate' the main character by outsmarting him but still someone that anyone would like to have as a friend.

Implementation and writing are the biggest problems. No one objects to a woman lead in a movie but when you make her inhumanly capable and use the belittling of everyone around her(usually men) as her selling point then it becomes unlikeable to both genders since no one can relate. That, and their characters are used in movies where the stories and directing are dogshit. Put them together and you get Marvel's 27th flop(I lost count).	[]

It's social engineering. They didn't try to attract an audience that didn't exist, they tried to create it. They believe they know how men and women should be. That's why everyone resents them	[]
Im not sure if men and women don't generally like the same things.  Most women i know like the same types of films etc and they are put off by all these crappy shows with female leads.	['We all recognize the same things: Good writting and good acting. I can watch literally all kinds of genres as long as the movie/the show I am watching is well made. Of course shows like Bridgerton will have a predominantly female audience and movies like Rocky have a male one but there is so much in between that we all can come together for....it just has to be done well and not lazy, agenda driven garbage.']
As an XX  woman I will pay to see hot males.	[]
Marvel had me, I was the type of person that was fine with schilling out money to them for their movies. Once they started making woke shows/movies I stopped caring.	[]
They could just make female action hero movies that are unwoke again. They used to do that all the time. Japan still does it.	[]
"Most important line: ‚Äúeven if I personally didn‚Äôt like it, that doesn‚Äôt matter because it wasn‚Äôt made for me.‚Äù

Not everything is made for you as a consumer. Not everything needs to be forced to a particular consumer if you are a producer. This is so important to understand."	"[""I've seen plenty of movies and TV that wasn't made for me. But here's the thing, if it was a well written and executed entertainment, I would enjoy it. Or at least I could respect it. Example: Craig of the Creek isn't made for me (M, 50s), but I love to watch it with my son. I wasn't put off by it like I was with say, Teen Titans Go! Downton Abby wasn't made for me either. But when I would watch the show and movies with my Wife, I did enjoy it.""]"
A movie written for females with no buff male actors. So a movie targeting lesbians, good luck with that!	[]
Disagree with you re Maverick. Loads of normal women were very keen to see that movie. I'd wager they were more excited than the man. (Sadly it lacked the sexual chemistry of Top Gun so didn't meet female expectations).	[]

"Tatiana Maslany in She Hulk blows my mind. She's preposterously talented as evidenced in Orphan Black (even though that show went off the rails over time) and deserves better roles. I am disappointed that she didn't shred those she hulk scripts upon first reading, but a girl's got to work. I'm surprised the woke crowd even allowed that title - ""She Hulk"". A diminutive Hulk with an assumed gender? Oh but then also better than Hulk, got it.

Also, Bris Larson's head is like 20% too big for her body."	[]

"I think modern filmmakers forget that there was a time long ago when there were well written female characters. Ellen Ripley, Leia (Before the dark times), Claire Starling, and Sarah Conner. There have been good female characters in the last few years. Vi and Jinx from Arcane, Imperator Furiosa from Mad Max. Hell, even Disney did alright with Jyn Erso and Kate Bishop (you can argue this one but I think she‚Äôs written semi-decently). But now, everyone needs to be flawless and are being suppressed by the patriarchy and learn that they were perfect all along.
Go back to the 80s when movies were about a good story and not about identity politics, feminism, and *THE MESSAGE*"	"[""No. Those were the lead up for the feminist characters.

They need to remove the ideological writing constraints that have been put on every script since 2015. Let a man rescue a woman the time to time. Let a man teach a woman from time to time. Let the woman be a woman and man be a man. Show an appropriate amount of reverence for the past and for people with experience and a track record of success And most importantly, judge the creators by their product not their beliefs. Let them create.	"[""Time to time? That's how it is in real life. You just didn't notice the pre woke stuff in the 80s and 90s because it was subtle."", 'I‚Äôm well aware.

The stuff they push has really damaged the relationship between men and women, primarily to the detriment of women if you ask me. Same with social media.	[]
"Women want an excess of things made for them--the time, resources and energy necessary to generate objects of value--so that they may accept or reject them on a whim.  They don't celebrate the work and artistry, they demand customized products--so they can judge them based on arbitrary and often contradictory criterion which change from one moment to the next.  Then they complain that ""no"" movies are being made for them, after rejecting and neglecting the glut of those that have.  

It's a bit like dating in current year."	[]

"Turned on a children's show on Disney+ about Jedi academy children. I was thinking about having my kids watch it. Entire cast was minority, not a single white character. One of their main characters is a girl who has two moms. All of this within the first couple of episodes. It has the generic kids adventure and story telling, with all the blatant wrappings of woke propaganda around it. They are abusing the corpse of star wars to push their trash ideas.

Hollywood put political pandering over pandering to audiences to make money. And it's costing them."	[]
people are also just sick of capeshit	[]
"The chart at 3:17 in the video is skewed to minimize the difference with men.  Notice that ""100"" on the horizontal chart is not where the vertical scale intersects.  If you reset the lines so that the 2 axes meet at ""100"" then the only female dominant genres are ""romance"", ""musical/dance"" and ""drama"".  Everything else falls above 100 (i.e. it is attended more by men than women).  In addition, if you look at what lies to the right of 110 on the horizontal axis (male genres) and compare that to what lies to the left of 90 on the same axis (female genres) the male genres outnumber the female genres by 8 to 2 or 6 to 2 if we are being generous, and everything that they tried to make female-centric in the MCU, DCU, LucasFilms, Game of Thrones/Lord of the Ring, Star Trek, Spiderverse is MALE.  Women want Musicals and Romance and if you can put that into the MCU (say the romance between Hulk and Black Widow) then fine, but you still have the men driving the box office."

The problem is that they are trying to target an audience that just isn‚Äôt interested. Women don‚Äôt generally care about the WNBA, STEM or superheroes.

Madam web is the worst movie ever created and I am not even kidding.	[]
Tons of women love romantic sub-genres like low fantasy. They could have gotten the female audience by writing stories in the universe that have stronger romance/relationship, but then they would have had to admit that women like romantic stories more than stories about saving the universe.

Comics have been a male dominated art form, both on paper and behind the scenes. And women still read them. Why? Because some women like that masculine style. So changing that style, and placing women in the lead, alienates all those women who fell in love with the masculine aspect of comics.	"['Pssst....it\'s called ""penis envy"", and the last decade has shown us that it\'s a real thing. They follow men to every corner of the earth and invade all male only spaces. They then complain that there are no ""manly men"" left when THEY are the ones who assured it would happen. They are literally un please able.']"

"I'm still not sold that this will be a comfortable change for movie makers. Obviously, the money losses have forced some to see that they're on the wrong track, but there are plenty more wrong tracks to divert onto.

I don't think there will be balance again. I think there will be mandates coming down to overcorrect again. It's entirely possible that we'll start getting the equivalent of those old parodies of action films, with the excessive yelling, excessive gun porn, and women draping themselves over muscley men, except, instead of funny, tongue in cheek parodies, they'll try to come out as straight faced, serious shows.

I don't think Hollywood knows what ""balance"" is anymore. They only know buzzwords and income projections. The ones running the show have no idea what people want. And they're strangely proud of that."	[]
Wait.What? I thought feminism was over. What the heck, I didn't get the memo. We're still doing this nonsense.	[]
"*putting on clown makeup meme*

That's exactly correct men and women to like different things. women like chocolate, red wine and shoes while men like women, even the gay chaps like women it's just that they are 'in the closet' as they call it preventing them from being open about it...

Its fine to have a female lead if shes a three dimensional well developed well written character. Seems simple but apparently not.	[]
I think a lot of it was Disney buying brands to reach the boy's market, only to default to their original demographic because they didn't know how to manage male-oriented franchises.	[]

i think that, for the first time, your assessment might be wrong here, Drinker. i don't think these movies are meant to pander to females, i think they are meant to TEACH MEN A LESSON so that we become good people and want to see all female heroes, too. it's a morality play.	[]

"The ""Girlboss"" was always doomed to fail, because nobody likes an arrogant jerk main character who's incapable of failing.

James Bond never had everything go perfectly, he always had to adapt.

Ripley had her crew die around her and lost her ship.

Sarah Connor needed help to beat the T-1000.

But the ""Girlbosses"" (and gary stus) can't fail AND they're jerks while doing it, or they're bland, or they're confusing because they should be hated for what they're doing.

"Something all creators need to know is this; it's okay to have a target audience. It's okay for your story to be aimed at girls, boys, men, or women, or any other group. If your story is exceptional, you'll attract people outside your target demographic. After all, there are adults who like Bluey, non-Christians who like VeggieTales and Narnia, and I know men who like The First Wives Club (excluding me), but you've GOT to keep focus.

And for audiences, remember; not being the target audience doesn't mean you're excluded."	[]
"The problem overall are the writers. 
These writers today are so far up their own ass. 
They grew up in the early Reddit days whereby you could only win an argument by being louder and more aggressive instead of better. 

None of them have ever seen Alien, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil or Terminator and it‚Äôs so evident. 

Those great heroines weren‚Äôt born amazing they were just great at adapting to new situations and had good leadership skills. 

Not one of those characters would have gone out of their way to fight a 6ft+ dude jacked to the tits unless there was no other way out of it. 

Now we have girl bosses who can take out rooms filled with men who ARE stronger than them but they nerf themselves.

"Tons of manga's and anime's most popular female characters could be considered ""girlboss"" and yet they find an appeal"	"['To be honest, I find much of anime and manga to be the opposite end of the problem, where they make so many of the ladies too weak in character. Not just in physicality, but also in personality (where they are extremely emotional or exaggerated) and contribution to the story. \n\nWhat I find ironic is that both Hollywood and numerous animanga seem to assume that traditional femininity is weak, despite the fact that historical women were nuanced and extremely helpful to societies. There\'s so many things you could do with a ""traditional"" female character such as helping people get through times of war while men are away. But hardly anyone wants to give it a shot.\n\nOf course, as you said, there are female characters in animanga who are well-written. But lets not assume that the industry is without its problems.', 'Well it depends on the genres. Shonen(boy) manga/anime is usually and almost always headlined by strong interesting male characters that get stronger and stronger as the series progresses, with interesting female side characters that actually act as supporting characters to the main male characters and nothing more. Shoujo(girl) manga/anime is geared towards the traditional female Japanese teenage audience and has more drama and romance in it instead of pure action and power-ups. Again, manga and anime in Japan is strictly divided between genres that are based on the traditional divide of the two genders, so even if you have a female-led Shonen anime or manga, it\'s still going to be designed in a way to appeal to the 13 -15 year old Japanese boys.\n\nSeinen manga/anime for example, is strictly aimed for Japanese men of 18+ and above, and it contains adult material of the most extreme kind that wouldn\'t pass in most Western countries, like in ""Berserk"", "" Blade of the Immortal"" and the likes.', '@@cadethumann8605 This is not an issue unless you are a westerner and has no understanding of how traditional Japanese society is. They don\'t make them ""too weak"", they simply make them as supporting characters in genres that specifically aim towards Japanese boys and men like Shonen and Seinen. What you refer to are female side characters in the Shonen genre for the most part, that are usually portrayed as such because it\'s the traditional male power trip in the way it\'s designed and there\'s nothing wrong with that. There are many anime and manga where the female protagonists are very strong mentally and physically, so your initial statement is in fact inaccurate.', '@rpgadventurer32\xa0 That\'s quite the generalization of what men want where they find women being  sexualized and acting childish to be a ""power trip"". Even if you wish to prioritize male characters getting thr limelight, you could at least still have FC behave somewhat human. What\'s worse is that many are out into compromising situations against their will such as being upskirted, being SA as ""humor"", or having their clothing torn for ""fanservice"". Even when I was a teenage boy, I never found this appealing.\n\nAnd you want to know something? People can have their cake and eat it too and still have it written well. You can have character showing skin in a situation that makes sense (like at a beach), where it\'s thematic (like a femme fetale), or still looking dignified (IMO, Yor\'s assassin attire from SpyXFamily looks attractive AND badass). You can also have a supportive FL that ticks off several fantasy boxes and still behaves with nuance and humanity. But the way many works are, they are just written with poor taste.', '@@rpgadventurer32 In fact, even the anime legend that is Miyazaki complained about how sexualized women are and that they are written in a way as if artists never bothered to take inspiration from reality.']"

For some reason it's become literally immoral to suppose the sexes can have differences."", 'I don\'t think the issue is that men and women are ""different"". The issue is that these movies are trying too hard in making one sex seem so powerful that they are lacking humanity. Meanwhile, the other is downplayed in importance and contribution (not to mention, talked down to). If the roles were reversed with men being OP and devoid of vulnerability while women are less helpful and talked down to, I\'d have the same issue.\n\nMen and women do have differences such different physicality and experiences.

Mizu from Blue Eye Samurai is the only thing keeping girlboss trend alive.	[]
"As much as I want to believe it, I know that Hollywood will just double down on it and blame fans. 
Also: Sony lost $10 Million dollars in value on Monday. 
I guess angry lesbians, girl bosses, token Spider-Man, and broken remakes didn‚Äôt bring in the money."	[]
It is premature to declare the girl boss dead. Take into account decades of brainwashing. This is not going away any time soon.	[]
"Here is a simpler rule in the world of finance ""something that cannot go on forever, won't"".  Girlboss movies have arrived at the ""won't""."	[]
I would not be surprised if alot of these ‚Äúgirlbosses‚Äù tried to take on men twice their size in real life‚Ä¶to negative results üòÇ	[]
Love your videos Drinker!	[]
If women are so strong, why are transwomen winning all female competitions?	"['üòÖ', 'The trans are more whamenly', ""It all comes down to testostrone.  There's a serious lack of testosterone in female."", '\u200b@@stonecodfish2365The microplastics speak!', 'Because if you go by the modern doctrine of subjectivism, trans women are women.']"
zero chance it ends it feels like it‚Äôs accelerating and it doesn‚Äôt matter how much money they lose . Look what‚Äôs happening with the X-Men animated reboot . It‚Äôs never going to end .	"[""No it's not. This is the demoralization phase. ALL your heroes will die."", 'What happening with the x men reboot?']"
Were winning this culture war. When victory is finally achieved, let‚Äôs not forget those who we lost, meaning all our beloved franchises butchered in the altar of ‚ÄúTHE MESSAGE‚Äù.	[]

I miss characters such as Seline ( Underworld ) , Beatrix ( Kill Bill ) and Rita Vrataski ( Edge of tomorrow ) , but nowadays i only see characters such as Ray ( Star Wars ) and Captain Marvel ( Marvel )	"[""Don't forget Akasha from Queen of the Damned."", 'Frieren as well.', ""You mean Ray and Captain marvel are different characters? I didn't realize..."", '@BetaSuqad >> They mentioned Beatrix (The Bride).', 'Kate beckinsdale was class as Seline']"
Girlboss'd all the way to the sun and can't understand why their wings keep falling off. We need more of this girlbossing.	[]
Even if the girlboss trend dies, companies will still try to exploit it to (attempt to) make a few Pennie‚Äôs more.	[]
"I gave up on mainstream Hollywood in 2015. I could see the way it was going back then. I've just watched classic TV and movies ever since then. Anyone who continues to give these ""productions"" a chance and actually spends money to see them, is only contributing to the problem."	"[""Me too honestly the only Hollywood type movies I have seen is beekeeper and Soon\nLand of bad because ironically r rated action movies seem to the only genre that doesn't have this issue \n\nOutside of that it's mostly anime because Japan actually cares about writing a good story""]"
Excellent analysis üññüèΩ	[]
FLAT EARTH.	[]
Directors nowadays: Wow this is dogshit... That's a wrap.	[]
I have a feing that we'll see the return of Pulp. Just look at Reacher. He's practically the modern day Doc Savage	[]
Nothing says ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù like making movies for women, and then getting mad at men for not being interested in them.	['And the kicker? Men are the ones who go to these movies; not women.', 'I‚Äòd say the most out of touch people in a society are those that dress the most ridiculous üòÇ, Hollywood fits the bill and their are other examples throughout history', 'Well the men should just love the fact that they are becoming obsolete and enjoy whatever is left that they clearly don‚Äôt deserve. Apparently.', 'Well, judging by the numbers women are not buying tickets either. Most women are not that stupid', '@@LordVulcan93 Those men are beta males']
early af 55 seconds ago?	[]
thank god	[]
i‚Äôm starting to realize you‚Äôre just a big crybaby who‚Äôs never been touched by a woman. i‚Äôm surprised i‚Äôve been subbed this long	[]
The whole boss girl era saved me a lot of money on movie / TV show purchases	"['It‚Äôs amazing how much time some people spend hating movies and TV shows with women in them. It‚Äôs an odd hobby, for sure.', 'The (good thing) about this woke era is that it saves us money.', '@@sthubbins4038\nThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not why they hate them.', ""\u200b@@sthubbins4038 Ironic considering you've spent the last 5 years coming to what u consider right wing channels and desperately hating in the comments ü§î \nAmazing huh"", '@@realnamehidden1314It‚Äôs exactly why they hate them. It‚Äôs right there in the title of the video.üòÇ']"
So many bad movies in the last yearüòÖ	[]
Can we go back to telling great stories with great characters ?! Instead of trying to get a stupid message across ?	[]
Thank god	[]
Despite what the higher ups try to tell you, bosses can be fired and replaced.	[]
helllooo, imagine if Sex And The City were taken over by conservatives that is what has happened to male franchises.	[]
100 likes in 60 seconds. Makes studios jealous.	[]
Ripley is one of the most prolific and badass Sci-Fi characters of all time. Just write women like that. Problem solved.	"[""Terminator 1 and 2's Linda Hamilton.  Im glad they only made 2 Terminator movies"", ""Problem is women like Ripley have DEPTH and SELFLESSNESS, something most narcissistic, modern women are incapable of. Why submit to a husband (who'd take a bullet for you) when you can submit to your boss? (who barely knows your name) Why give birth and know selfless love, when you can engage in meaningless hedonism?"", ""Ironic as Ripley's part was written for a male actor."", ""They don't want that. They want to remove the main male characters from their own franchises.""]"
I hope so, this trend is really getting old.	[]
Thank God	[]
Unfortunately they'll keep doubling down on making her a chick and gay	[]
