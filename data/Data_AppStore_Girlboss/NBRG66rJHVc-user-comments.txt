The reaction to ‚Äúgumption‚Äù 5 min has me dying	[]
Women have always worked just as much (if not more) than men and girlboss is just another way to gaslight women into thinking doing more is exciting and joyous and something that will make them stand out and not at all more for your already overfilled plate	[]
If women allowed men to be househusbands without cheating on them and if they allowed men to work with children this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Another thing that is open to debate is that women want to spend more time with her children.	[]
"The issue with it is when ""girlboss"" is synonymous with feminism. It's not feminist to subvert other women for your benefit"	[]
Thought-provoking üí≠	[]
Sincerely girl boss isnt for everyone that dont mean women who want to be girl bosses shouldn't aspire to be one	[]
God I hate Devil Wears Prada. I get that girlboss is a problem but it felt like the film framed it as - men be right tho women need to be women	[]
omg you are here, I love it.	[]
"The thing about having it all. Is it's hard to keep it all.

My mom worked 3 different careers as my father worked construction and steel work. As she worked as a nurse and security guard while being a mom.

The truth was as my parents aged they worked hard to make sure to be there with with family as much as their work. Now that their older they worry they didn't do as much with us.

And now that my mom has stopped working she revels in having free time"	[]
"Great to find this. Been binging Lindsay Ellis's videos lately, and she keeps referring back, in recent videos, to this idea of the ""girlboss"" but here I can actually see her address the topic head on."	[]
Life‚Äôs hard, then you die.	[]
Women are less willing to sacrifice personal life and more prone to whining, that's why they get fewer promotions. Deal with it, ladies.	[]
Kind of off topic but how did I never realize  Miranda Priestlys' husband is Nate Archibalds grandfather?	[]
Was it me or Andy NEVER wanted to pursue a career in fashion journalism at all, even with the time she spent with Miranda?	[]
"i think ""girlboss"" feminism is more respectable than making videos about disney movies and e-begging lol"	[]
You're much kinder in the #girlboss criticism than most I've seen. I guess the problem is how they self promote as feminist ideals.	[]
This is such a great video-- literally took the words right out of my mouth. THANK YOU!	[]
The truth is, my fel≈ëlem bosses was all horrible, especially in communication.	[]
Correct... I need to be the charismatic stern and power man male figure AND the kind giggly sweet woman figure. I recently had someone tell me I should try smiling with my eyes to come across more friendly :)	[]
So eloquent	[]
"I really do not like the 'Sis"" gendered term"	[]
I WANT a family. I‚Äôm getting it. I want kids, a husband; I am ready to submit and be submitted to. I spent years being too afraid to go for it because I was convinced I would be a loser if I didn‚Äôt subscribe to a noticeable degree to the ‚Äúhustler‚Äù/‚Äúgurlboss‚Äù lifestyle. I‚Äôm done. I can work AND have a family. I fell for it; I spent years hiding from my true dreams. I was deceived. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I was sooo unhappy. I‚Äôm so glad I got over my socially induced psychosis!	[]
i love what you said about Molly on insecure	[]
Why should somebody pay you to take care of YOUR children and to clean YOUR mess?	[]
I hate even hearing the word ‚Äúgirlboss‚Äù but I‚Äôll listen to Lindsay explain basically anything	[]
Lmao imagine living in a country where child care isn't an equal responsibility between parents. Whack	[]
I knew I loved Living Single for a reason. I have such a new perspective on the show after watching this. Thank you!	[]
I‚Äôd rather be seen as the bitchy boss and man eater than being pinned down & oppressed by a misogynistic husband strangled with two kids. Honestly, I don‚Äôt think working women are bitchy, nor stay at home mothers are unhappy. But, if these were the only two choices (as most media claims) I know which I‚Äôd rather have.	[]
5:45 EXACTLY I'LL TATTOO THIS ON MY FOREHEAD	[]
Do you notice that basically all negative behaviour towards women comes from another women, and the men that think they have to comply...	[]
Also I find the term sexist not empowering... It should just be boss? ü§î	[]
"If you type this or ""entrepreneur"" into Instagram I literally promise you it's just selfies"	['Or MLM product pitches or booty picks that have weirdly prose captions for no reason.']
"Funnily enough, Anne Hathaway later starred in a film with the exact opposite message of The Devil Wears Prada - The Intern. She plays the head of a fashion company who's considering hiring a CEO to give herself less work - because her husband is the stay at home dad who's having an affair. But the end message is that the husband needs to work on his insecurities, which he does by ending the affair, confessing everything and assuring her to stay in control of her company. And she's portrayed as a nice boss as well, although her assistant is a bit overworked.


And there's a positive example from friggin 1942 in Now Voyager. An heiress chooses not to get married or pursue the man she loves because she wants to use her family's money to help the mental health system, based off her own experiences getting over a nervous breakdown."	[]
Love the use of diverse TV shows !!!!	[]
nice	[]
Such a well thought out video. Thank you for making this and thank you for referencing Insecure and Living Single.	[]
This was a good video. It was very encouraging. Thanks for including all kinds of women! Including those like me who are moms.	[]
Really sick of hustle culture. I feel like a failure all the time no matter what I accomplish. Yes it‚Äôs problematic that there are sexist aspects of wanting women to largely be mothers, but some of us Millenial women are starting to resent the pressure to BE a girl boss! Yes I enjoy my victories but I hate that it‚Äôs a constant uphill struggle to attain some nonexistent ideal. I find myself unsexed and enjoying power more than sex, and feeling disdain for everything maternal! I wish you‚Äôd covered this problem, Lindsay. Well done video overall.	[]
Lets be honest here. How many of  relation actually have father in equation anymore? Divorce and single parenthood are the mores.  Marriage or even men seem to be secondary thought now days. Secondly was it not how men were portrayed as boss men (for decades in cinema) who took their wives for granted and focused on career. And hence wives fell into arms of their new love .  What is good for goose is good for gander. This is conundrum of feminism. It was built on anti marriage foundation (if we actually take time to read about its history) and yet could not obliterate evolutionary rules which is propagation of species which fueled the whole patriarchal structure meant to protect the children.  Someday it will be interesting to get feminist view on poor male character writings in Hollywood	[]
You still don't get it, do you ? Even if you put all women in the positions of CEOs and top managers , that is not going to make you happier, because then you will be complaining that there are not enough eligible men to marry and have a family with. Women who are happiest are the ones that are being taken care of financially by their men, who embrace their femininity and make an effort to be good mothers ( that involves caring for your own children ,not paying some stranger to do it).	['not all people capable of giving birth want children. success looks different to everyone.']
The biggest issue with female bosses is that they don‚Äôt realize they have been pushed into management whether or not they are qualified. In the span of 10 years female managers at a company I‚Äôm familiar with went up 5 fold. All of them had the ‚Äòcredentials‚Äô - college, years on the job, etc. but not had the personality it takes. To compensate, they acted like ‚ÄòB‚Äôs‚Äô. I think for the good of both bosses and employees, it would be better to acknowledge that this may be a several generation‚Äôs correction.	[]
"I like that she brought up that it's not always helpful to frame the ""girlboss"" narrative as women should be just like their male counterparts. While I'm all for assertive, take-no-prisoner, badass ladies, so much of American (traditionally masculine) workplace culture isn't empowered, it's just straight-up toxic and abusive. I want to see women succeed, but I hate seeing people promote the idea that being cut-throat, exploitative, and selfish are good ""boss"" practices. You're not a #girlboss if you support unfair labor practices, throw fellow employees under the bus, or insist people sacrifice their well-being like you did to get ahead - you're just another powerful asshole."	[]
Jon Hamm is just tall	[]
I didn‚Äôt realize Glenn Close almost always plays this type of character.  Especially if you include Dangerous Liaisons	['And Damages.']
i like how she gave the idea that we should towards a future where we can get to the top by building each other up rather than bringing other people down.	[]
I adore Lindsay Ellis!!	[]
Lol ‚Äúwomen‚Äù....just look at your moms. Take the good and leave the bad. My mother was a bad mother. And it was just her nature. She never could be the mom I wanted her to be. But what works for someone doesn‚Äôt work for the other. Individual power and just plain believing in yourself. Lol	[]
"Great video.  And all the social problems with trying to reach the top of a company... are the reason more brilliant women should try to open their own shops.  Do we really want to waste decades (of the only life we know we'll get... for those of you who don't believe in reincarnation) on proving the feminists are ""right"" because men/society are mean to us?  Fuck it, I say.  If you're going to bust your ass to get to the top, it's better to play by your own rules.  Chances are, you're more likely to win that game.  And I know some people might be thinking that not every woman has the means to open her own shop.  But the truth is that it's not about overnight success.  Nothing good ever truly is.  In this life, I don't want to compare myself with where a man at my age is.  I am my own person, with my own timeline and my own story (and money)."	[]
What? Higher standards for women? Noooooo, that nEveR happens	[]
Great analysis but the blanket assumptions about women of colour is quite damaging. Especially since ‚Äúof colour‚Äù refers to people coming from non-European cultures aka the rest of the world. Generalisation of people from the rest of the world inadvertently others them. Colour is a spectrum and you can‚Äôt say that they as a rule have it harder. If you can‚Äôt be more specific, then you probably shouldn‚Äôt comment on them.	[]
Wtf is in the pot at 2:51????	[]
Peggy was encouraging and helpful to any woman who showed interest in moving up. There just werent many who were.	[]
#havingitall = #doingitall	[]
I literally had a rage over this with my mum the other week....huuumph	[]
"I've only started been talked to for a future management position at my current job. My current job is currently staffed by women. Every other job has over looked me because they say things like ""well yes your qualified but dont you want to focus on finding a husband? "" yes this is something that was said to me not by my manager but by A supervisor of another area when I complained I couldn't get ahead"	[]
There's something I have to speak about from my childhood experience : yes, the husband is the breadwinner. It's ideal to work 9-to-5, monday to friday, to build business, but it's not the reality. The reality is that my father work 11-12 hours a day, monday-saturday, 2-3 times/month business travelling. So, I can say that he's pretty much absent during my childhood. When he was older and really settle down, I'm already attending college, so I really never know him much.	[]
"Men who work in higher position (many just inherit and its more genetic lottery and grooming) sacrifice everything to get there -social life, family, friends, health, and free time to get there.
Women that work over 50 hours a week is under 15%
To get to the top is giving up alot of emotional needs.   For the people that want the brass ring there is no Netflix and chill, Sunday brunches, or sabbaticals.

Its hard work with sacrifice"	[]
You forgot to mention why most women give up climbing the corporate ladder during the midfle of their careers. Because a lot of them choose to have a family at that time and decide to work less. It's been proven in studies, and it isn't always necessarily because of their gender.	[]
Living single and Girlfriends truly inspired me growing up. Loved seeing all those women enjoying freedom and independence	[]
I was thinking about the character of Patry Hewes in Damages only to realize it would have been the third character in your clip with Glenn Close. Why is it that they always give these roles to her?	[]
Part of having more women in boss level is with having paid maternity leave... many women having to have to choose between having children or career. Don‚Äôt tell me women are not bing punish by having to take off few weeks or even months to have children	[]
I wanna watch living single!	[]
Great video!	[]
So fascinating. There could be an entire college Seminare on this topic.	[]
The Law? In the UK more trainee lawyers are women. However that‚Äôs not translated to Barristers yet. By sheer numbers though that‚Äôs likely to changer or at least get better.	[]
I literally watched fatal attraction last night. Wtf world?	[]
2:51 what's that?	[]
Woman boss....not girl boss	[]
"A nice book about the topic is ""A good time to be a girl"" by Helena Morrissey. 
Morissey talks (besides other topics) about embracing your femininity while being a business woman."	[]
I LOVE this new series and Lindsay. This is so good.	[]
"Same for men, it comes at these expenses :)  but women get more attacked for it, cause society still expects them to be domestic creatures.  good mothers as for men..., not really.

Marriage Story"	"[""The being a good father story is still, hey be a good father when you have time. You work hard, it's ok if you do not share the domestics.""]"
I think a big reason why you have the double standard of women having to give up family to have a career while men are able to have both is that women tend to not be attracted to men who make less money than they do. One person usually has to be the primary moneymaker while the other parent has to be the primary childcare giver and women tend to lose attraction for men who take on the primary domestic role. The husband picks up on that loss of attraction and it causes stress in the marriage.	"[""That is a load of alt-right bullcrap.  That is not reality at all.

For me, Leslie Knope is a great #girlboss You guys should check out the video The Take did about her!	[]
First of all I have to admit that when I hear Girl Boss I just think of early seventies Japanese Girl Gang movies. That being said I wonder if some of this is due to years of men being told to defined themselves by their work and nothing matters more than that pay check, while women are told the impotence of having and raising children. I often think about the differences males and females,  such as often when someone is hurt or unwell  males will pretty much ignore the person while more often that not females will care about said persons well being. I often think of my dad who when I got injured such as scrap a knee or get a cut his response always (in dry dark humor)  do you want to cut it off. Mom of course was the opposite and help me deal with the injure.	"[""toxic masculinity stems for the systematic culture that surrounds us. Which indeed tells men need to do x, be x, cannot show feelings unless it's anger and super confidence, etc.""]"
"The issue for me is that we continue to define success in the parameters of a materialist and shallow capitalist society which glorifies recognition or fame, wealth and upper class privilege. 
Why should anyone, women or men, put a premium on sacrificing our time and family for these kind of returns. Our values are often warped. We are expected to use, consume without conscience and approve, even if apathetically, exploitive industries and methods. Not just to blue collar or oversea workers but to even the close around us. 

Women aspire to success within their career which can be good or bad depending on where your values are compromised. There's nothing wrong with opting to not have children but sacrificing all meaningful human relationships for your career will only make you unhappy and is a poor representation of a full and balanced life. That goes for any human being. However there's also something to be said about doing meaningful work, it just shouldn't be scrutinized on the basis of making money or being successful in a certain kind of way that is praised in our society. 

For myself, creating a meaningful life is about balance. Recognizing values require responsibility to the duties that feed those values. Unfortunately, household duties or familial relational duties and the emotional work that it requires as well as the practical, is often demeaned as unimportant compared to making money or acquiring accolades in public life. We continue to see the household (our home where we nourish and rest) and children as burdens to split instead of things to cherish. Perhaps it is the patriarchal influence that we still define these by. 

We should want to put time in with family and relationships, seeking after work that makes a qualitative difference for others and inspires you to think beyond yourself and your accumulation. Conscious exploration of your interests and loves. 
You really do have to constantly pull back here and give there and then the next moment give there and pull back here. You can't have it all in equal measures, it's about constantly readjusting. We only have so much time and ourselves to give so you have to choose wisely.

The honest situation is that societal and cultural expectations are what shape our experience and instead of consciously deciding, we fall into the grooves of these expectations. Men are pressured to be breadwinners over being caretakers and vice versa for women. But carving out your own path in regards to these shouldn't be formulaic.
 My mother was the primary breadwinner and my father often took care of us. Not in a way that demeaned either one of them to be chained to that. And roles changed over years with my mother being able to have more the with us in other parts of our lives. I never thought that one person did one thing in our family. We all did caretaking, chores, shared financial responsibilities. However, in my life with my partner, we have had to mix up roles in a more traditional way because we have different circumstances. Still okay. I'm living the life we chose together and that's the most important thing."	[]
"""we can't pretend on a whole that the whole family vs career is a construct because the reality is in most cases it is harder for women to find that balance, 
but at the same time pursuing your dreams and becoming a leader in your field doesn't mean that women should copy the toxic behavior of their male counterparts. yes girlbosses are 'still building their empire' 
*but the thing about that is that no empire was built on stepping on anybody else, and that is rather a patriarchal approach to power.* so perhaps, that's a blueprint we should consider throwing away altogether."""	[]
I feel immense pressure by the #girlboss movement to be extremely successful, independent, smart, interesting and of course beautiful. Obviously I think it‚Äôs great that we‚Äôre doing progress, but what if I can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to be all those things at the same time? I‚Äôm a human, not a robot.	[]
The fact that Living Single is getting the belated respect is proof that show is should be head and shoulders above The Cosby Show.	[]
The huge majority of the gap comes from difference in choices between men and women. This includes business.	[]

Lindsay Ellis is one of my favorite YouTubers! I'm happy that you brought her on	[]
"Yes! Ignoring the fact that ""working hard"" is all you need and that there are no societal obstacles."	[]
"I absolutely agree on everthing said here, but please let us not forget, that ""having it all"" is by far not everyone's goal. I've been laletly feeling some shame toward woman who don't pursue the girl boss lifestyle. From early age I've been expected to aspire working in science or law, make that money and live the career life. Does my wish to live a stereotypically ""female"" role make me a bad women or an anti-feminist? I don't think so.


I am a white, cis womam in my 20ties and I do want to work in a social field even if it won't made me rich and have children, may not work for some years to spend time with my kids and then hopefully go back working at least half-time and live a quiet life (with a loving husband, hopefully). I'm not a conservative, religious person, that's just me and I do believe that there are quite some women out there feeling similarly"	[]
hahahah weekend penis	[]
I mostly agree with your points, but I feel like rather than having more likable female CEOs in media we should stop having any likable CEOs period.	"[""What's the point of that? CEOs are still human and some are even - gasp! - likeable.\n\nI would much rather see a large range of characters.""]"
"This is very much the pattern that women in the Soviet Union dealt with. Women and men were equal in the workplace, but we're then expected to also do all the things at home.

It's why feminism got such a bad rep in the former Soviet Union.

aaaaand it's Lindsay! What a pleasent surprise! That makes it even better!!! <3	[]
Thank you,  so helpful!	[]
I just found out that Half and Half is a spin-off of Living Single. #themoreyouknow	[]
"I don't know if Mad Men is a good example.

It is a show that started 2007 about the 1960s. The social mores of that time as well as the struggles for women (especially Peggy) and minorities in the business is not portrayed as a given but as deeply flawed and concerning.


Also Peggy could have gone with Duck Phillips to move up."	[]
The fact that this video brought up both Living Single AND Half&Half is nothing short of incredible	[]
Really great tv show comparisons to bring unhinge your point. Very relatable. Love these episodes, hope they continue past January.	[]

I love this series, am thrilled to have Lindsay guest hosting, and want to reach as wide an audience as possible, so in that spirit, here's a candid anecdote: Even though I knew Lindsay was going to be hosting in the future, I didn't know this was one of her episodes, and the thumbnail didn't sell me enough to click. I only came back once Lindsay's Patreon sent an e-mail letting me know what this series was. Maybe consider changing up the thumbnail, putting her name and/or picture on the thumb, and maybe something in the title about what series this is? The retro aesthetic of the title really didn't draw me in, and usually the TFD style is pretty effective at drawing my attention - could just be me, of course! Keep up the great work, all of you at TFD and Lindsay Ellis Co.!	[]
"""No empire was ever built without stepping on someone else."" Well said"	['They all were actually. ;)', '@@rosacentifollia right?', 'Daaaaamn']

Hell yeah, Mad Men and Living Single!!	[]
"The opportunity gap definitely exists... Insecure seems interesting! I‚Äôll have to watch that.
When we pursue career success, it‚Äôs harder to do so than it is for men. Basically when you strive to have it all, ur often left with nothing. In business, career success is relational and as an attractive young female, you‚Äôre less likely to be seen as capable and more likely to be seen as a liability in taking time off to have children or someone they can‚Äôt be as comfortable around. For the past decade, I‚Äôve been laser focused on developing my technical and soft skills, and I can‚Äôt say that has gotten me far. Pulling all nighters to get something done isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve ever seen my male peers have to do. And in return, I usually get more ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù, dull projects, someone else‚Äôs job in addition to mine who is entry level, etc. I can‚Äôt wait for the day that women aren‚Äôt pigeonholed or discriminated in the workforce for their sex. In my career in corporate finance, you‚Äôll find many women as analysts and accountants but few as managers and I‚Äôve yet to meet more than 1 female CFO. And that‚Äôs definitely not because women aren‚Äôt as good. We aren‚Äôt even given opportunities for advancement."	[]
"2:58 How long have women been complaining that men put their careers before their families?  The only difference is that women are the only ones that have wombs+ovaries, and they're on the clock.  Deny all you want, but Mother Nature requires that you make the choice.
3:40 Because they're the sex which typically has more ""compassion"" hormones.
6:41 Oh that pesky uterus.  Have no fear, though: a few generations of the Pill's affect on society means that now there are more women in University.  I foresee  lots more women in the CxO suite in 30 years.
7:08 My former wife ""advocated for herself"" and got a hefty raise.  (Of course, I had to push her to do it, so as to not hear her constantly complain about being so poorly paid while doing so much.)"	[]
Oh look, a liberal feminist that uses cherry picked data and expects people to fit into her idea of what the world should be like....I'm so (not) surprised	[]
"Men in high pressure CEO positions also sacrifice having a good family life. Most often they have a wife who raises the kids and she doesn't work very much outside of that. Theoretically this would also work with a stay at home dad. There is a LARGE stigma against this, it's not all ""poor waman have to do all the child raising"". Men and women look down on men who do the typlical female role. That's why if a woman tries to make it in a high pressure career in the same way a man would she ends up without a family. Not to mention women trend to want to marry men who are more successful than them.

Not all of your points are wrong but I hate this ""only women have it hard"" attitude."	[]

Amazing video! Congrats! Love to see a honest evaluation from a very feminist point of view of this stereotipe of the #girlboss!	[]
"Thank you! 
I feel like our modern ""you can have it all, women"" thing really just looks like working constantly, for both no pay (maternity leave, caring for others) and less pay (normal job) while being judged as not good enough for either (because it's working two full time jobs that can't really get all the attention each, and we love judging women for everything)... It looks like a trap unfortunately that only the wealthy can escape. Or if you're in a country that values families and health (paid parental leave, affordable/free childcare and healthcare)."	[]
Lindsay!! I'm so happy to see you bringing your nuanced, beautifully presented discussions of gender and representation to The Financial Diet!	[]
was Lindsey's face not on the thumbnail?	[]
Ironically, I think the best depiction of a woman who ‚Äúhas it all‚Äù is Clair Huxtable in the Cosby Show. A successful career as a lawyer, 5 happy, healthy children, and a loving marriage.	"['It‚Äôs troublesome that this is what‚Äôs considered ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù. *All* is different for everyone. Kids, no kids, career, no career, married, not married, etc etc.', ""we see her at a time in her life as a mom with teenagers though. Without her husbands income also she probably wouldn't have good access to childcare that made her career possible to become as successful as she did .""]"
I have taken a hiatus from this channel and youtube for a bit, but damn you guys are delivering! Glad to be back ‚ô•Ô∏è Lindsay is my girl.	[]
"THIS is just sooo saaad. If we go on like this the future will be sad too. 

People standing alone or in ‚Äúpretend‚Äù/‚Äúmust‚Äù relationships all fighting for ‚Äúsucces‚Äù

Undermining the idea that childcare - is something that you don‚Äôt want something that is below. 

It‚Äôs exactly what‚Äô some  man did before: ohh yeah childcare is nothing only people who are below want to do it AKA women

Now it‚Äôs women who say: 
Yeah you rock it! - if they are career wise successful 

And in many case look down on women who choose family rather.... 
‚ÄòYou are so petty. I want my OWN life not some crying annoying thing‚Äô 


This is just SAD. That we promote this. This is not ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù this is ‚Äúmanism‚Äù AKA idealizing men‚Äôs traditional role - you know the meme: new way of feminism: wanting to become man.... 

And I‚Äôm not even talking about: how late childbirth is a problem - and that in the huge career building you loose many thing - one is your femininity. 

Why can‚Äôt feminine things be positive: giving birth, caring about others. 
Why see it as a weakness. Embrace it. Fight for the respect of motherhood.  

Please."	[]

Lindsay on the financial diet omg yessssssssss	[]
Another issue I have with the girlboss narrative is that is distorts what a working woman looks like. We need to celebrate working class women. Not just the ones that are executives at problematic corporations. Being an executive at an oil company, for example, isn't a good form of feminism. Women do tend to be more drawn to pro-social careers. Women are more likely to become teachers, nurses, most nonprofits I have experience with are female dominated. These are all careers where someone may have a great impact on the lives of others, but they may not be paid a high salary for it.	"['Also thinking of Coco where the great-great-grandmother started a shoe business that lasted decades after her death and ensures the family stays comfortable because whether the economy falls or rises, people will need shoes.', ""What makes it worse is that because of the tendency to dominate pro-social careers, women are often guilt tripped into doing more and more work for no extra compensation because they're doing it for the kids/sick/underprivileged. It's very exploitative.""]"
You had a lot of interesting and valid points. I've read #GIRLBOSS and I really liked it. I love anything that empowers and motivates people.	[]
Man I swear this video hit it right on the head. I always thought there was something odd with this type of person that people try to emulate.	[]
This was wonderful and had great points! Please, though CW for depictions animal abuse. I was not expecting that clip and I was not prepared to see it. Still, a very good and salient video (:	[]
"Neither men nor women can ""have it all."" You can either do one or two things really well, or you can do several things, but you'll do them badly. Make your choice."	[]
Kind of implies male bosses in fiction are all nice fellows and that portrayals in fiction should be ideals, some sort of educational Sesame Street model characters for how all adults should behave, for adult audiences.	[]

"Hi, I enjoy this video, just like all of the content from TFD.  However, I wasn't expecting to see an image of a cat being boiled in a pot.  I haven't seen Fatal Attraction, so I didn't know that was coming.   I'm usually not sensitive to violent imagery, but animal abuse really disturbs me.  The clip was very sudden and unexpected in an otherwise innocuous video.    Thank you for all the wonderful, topical, and informative content you create, and I humbly request that you warn viewers before showing potentially upsetting imagery.   I know I'm being ""that person"", so thank you for your patience and understanding when considering my comment."	"[""I think it's a rabbit, isn't it?"", ""@@tugger Yes, I think you might be right.  I got to thinking later that it could have been a rabbit or even a puppy, but I didn't exactly want to go back to check.  -_-'   :P""]"
I‚Äôve always said that a woman CAN have it all, just not at the same time!  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that either, you shouldn‚Äôt sacrifice one for the other. But more men need to step it up to take more responsibility at home if the woman is working.	[]
What an awesome change of host!  I've watched your material for  years and still glad to see new stuff	[]
This is such an awesome series! i love it	[]

"6:55 ""Individual Contributor Roles"" = non-manager providing their own labor = proletarian"	[]
Not every one  can be, or needs to be in a high-status leadership position to be a strong and worthwhile woman and family and outside-work life should be able to work for women, since it clearly works for many men. But with everyone having so much difficulty moving up in the workforce choices about jobs both are and feel very stark and terribly unjust sacrifices feel necessary for women and everyone else.  Even well before my own generation, I see just so many women who are CLEARLY wired for management and really driven who never get there.  I have no trouble seeing the wage gap and the glass ceilings and sticky floors.  Meanwhile, this whole evil female boss fear is this deeply chilling doom mindset, no mater how we rig our work/home balance. The struggle to feel boss-level control cuts accross all sexes and stripes and creeds, since work is so precarious in general and is a trap for women in particular (and in particular anyone dealing with compound oppression from other stigmatized identities).  The metaphor that seems most impactful here is the one of reality TV, where competition is cutthroat and people struggle simply to remain in the game.  Is there anyone in today's entertainment fiction making it work to have even a little of everything, nevermind having it all?  The possibility seems restricted to TV shows no newer than the 80s.  By all means mention any current TV girl workers who overwhelmingly make it work like that, but I really don't see it.  It's become hard to immagine. And that scares the shit out of me.	[]
LOVE this!!!!	[]
Shared on ever platform I have - THANK YOU for this.	[]
I freaking love Lindsay! Good choice!	[]
I'm a simple woman, I see Lyndsay Ellis's name, I like the video	[]
The #girlboss narrative is very limiting and reductive to the complexities of what women who want to pursue their dreams as well as want families go through.	[]
Welcome! I'm glad to see you here in a shorter format. Your videos on your channel look interesting, but I've never watched one because I don't have 30 minutes. I look forward to the next few weeks.	[]
This video is my fight song	[]
I watched this yesterday and was kinda whatever about it, mostly because I already knew most of this and I didn't really know any of the people/shows referenced. Then an ad for the Vogue editor's masterclass came up on the next video I watched and she seems so collaborative and nothing like the depiction in Devil Wears Prada. And I was like... OOOH that's the point. Thanks for making this! Clearly even those of us who 'get it' need to hear this sometimes üòÇ	[]
I loved loved loved this video! I got married pretty young at 22 and my husband and I have always been equals in every sense of the word, jobs, chores, (cooking not so much because he doesn't like it but he does the dishes), and just in general the way we treat each other with respect. At one point, I made more money than he did and I know some men are very intimidated by that but he was very proud of me and we just continued to move forward. I think that if a woman wants to start a relationship it is important for her to find someone that will truly respect her and if the relationship feels unequal in any way, you both should talk about it. We can have it all: money, relationship, career and kids. You just have to find the right person to have that with ‚ù§	['sadly most women dont have men like yours . you are blessed']

Great video!	[]
Shout out to talking about minorities and health.	[]
Thank God I found this channel	[]
Omg the girl boss mug is perfect.	[]
Definitely clicked this video because I thought it would be trashing MLMs again :D	[]
üëèüëèüëè such a good vid. I‚Äôm tired of people (esp fellow women) label men in power as ambitious, charismatic, career driven but female of power as a b***. We need more women uplifting over women. Men didn‚Äôt get into position of power by themselves, they did it by uplifting other men.	[]
This was so amazing	[]
My only issue in this video that it took slight jabs at men as if they are main reason why female bosses have such a bad rep in America.  If a man have those toxic qualities, he'll be a bad boss too!  It's our society and our anti-family culture in the work place that makes this crap so pervasive in the work place.  Businesses trying to be super competitive to make short term profits without ever giving a damn will lead a long term downfall.  This heartless business culture often include policies that offshore jobs, decreasing job stability, and lack of government investment in social programs.  As a society, we need to be better and strive to be bosses as  good human beings and not become a greedy evil POS.	[]
This is why it's better to work remotely or online only.	[]
Love this	[]
Lindsey!!!	[]
Nonsensical fallacies: Men vs. Woman. Let's ignore the personal utility involved in making individual choice in regards to choosing family over a career by over generalization  of the wage gap myth. When in doubt, feed the emotionally driven narrative popularized by mass media propaganda posing as entertainment based in reality. It's fiction, folks. How many of you believe that married couples actually slept in separate beds prior to the 1960's? Stupid is as stupid does.	[]

It is more difficult to work for a female boss than a male boss because usually the female boss is more aggressive. They have to be more aggressive than males need to get to the same position as the male boss.	[]

I feel like this video is missing a good takeaway. Yes, the term is problematic. And...?	['feel the same way.', 'Yes. I am trying hard to draw conclusions from the video and I failed']
I'd love to see those management and job progression stats broken out into age groups and the age groups of those in charge.

Wow so accurate	[]
Oh I love this!!! It's my thoughts worded perfectly! Never even understood why we can't just call ourself a boss, but need to keep the girl (not even woman!!) in. Ugh.	"['i also find it infantile to call yourself a ""girlBoss"" What are we ? 5?']"
"Damn, I was on board until she took a turn down ""intersectionality lane"" and started demanding that ""capitalism"" give a CEO position to LGBT, trans,  underprivileged women as if society owes it to them. Ugh."	[]
There you are, Lindsay!	[]
I am a white Canadian mom.  When I think of who is probably the best balance of what a true Girl Boss ought to be...I think of Michelle Obama.  She can probably run a country, stay on budget, make dinner and remind us to brush our teeth...while touching up her hair after her daily workout.  I was once told if I wanted to succeed, don‚Äôt marry, don‚Äôt have kids.  In the current reality, those things are the trade offs.	[]
Where are these under-performing male paternal figures? We gotta hunt them down and have a vigorous discussion about how they can contribute their full potential to their familial relationships.	[]
"This was awesome! One great example of embracing the new feminist boss in media is the show, ""The Bold Type."" They always talk about these dynamics and I love how the characters explore the issues without claiming to know all the answers."	[]

Thumbs down for the gender studies class terminology.	[]
I just discovered and subscribed to Lindsay a couple of weeks ago. I'm delighted to see her on FD this month.	[]
This was an awesome, well rounded discussion...and kudos for doing your research on Living Single/Half n Half...I always looked up to Maxime growing up (binge watching asap)	[]

I want to be successful but I also want a normal life to be a mom someday, n I genuinely feel like I could be able to do both. Hope anyone wanting this too gets to as well some dayüíñ	[]
Interesting thoughts. Since the term was coined by a vintage clothing online seller,  and I think, as a fellow online vintage seller myself, the term has become fun, endearing, and inspirational for me & many of us in the reseller community, as we can see how Sophia built something big, at doing what we do. I always felt the term applies to us, and I don‚Äôt think about it in any other context.	[]
I slammed that like button when Lindsay brought up how women now work as much as men, but are still doing most of the child rearing and unpaid household labor.	"[""It's *your* fault for not beating your boyfriend/husband every time he slacks off."", 'Emm... no?\n\n\nThe pay gap exists precisely because women work less hours than men\n\n\nAnd women are the primary receivers of welfare on account of children, society has several safety nets for women precisely because of childcare \n\n\nAlso, werent ""Strong &independent"" women refusing or delaying childbirth?\n\n\nWomen have decreased their traditional maternal duties but still receive the traditional maternal benefits, and men also do house chores now and we can tell they are not really hard, but lower marriage and childbirth rates means they are doing work and house chores for themselves, thats just regular self responsibility and has nothing to do with gender', 'Well ya big surprise there', ""@@GinHindew110 women work less hours because the do more house chores, according to statistic data in this video. Gender shouldn't matter there, yet it still does. (Althoug I do think it's a personal life choice. I work two jobs and my house is a mess, but both me and my bf live in a mess and just don't care most of the time. He cooks sometimes because he likes to cook, I prefer to eat out or to make a very simple quick dish).\nAlso, how do women receive maternal benefits when they decide to not have children or delaying childbirth? In that case they just work as much as men and don't have any additional benefits."", '@@banu0245 most women work less hours because of kids.']"

Thank you for bringing Livng Single into this. I feel seen.	[]
Cannot like this enough. I love the ending where you discuss human behavior in capitalism aka dehumanizing others by ‚Äústepping on‚Äù them to get ahead in your individual career and also love that you talk about how individualistic girlboss culture is.	[]
Since so much of the care-work is done by women, you usually won't find a sucessful woman with children. Angela Merkel would never had made it to the top if she had children to care for.	[]
I have been listening to Lindsay for a while now. I actually discovered her on The Financial Diet.  Happy to see you on this channel Lindsay! Looking forward to seeing more.	[]
My biggest problem with #girlboss is how forced on women it seems. I don‚Äôt really want to be an entrepreneur or high earner, yet I constantly question this because of how much it‚Äôs trending.	"['Bre Thinks I don‚Äôt think the #girlboss thing was made to make all women feel like they have to be entrepreneurs/high earners, I think it was made to empower those who want to be and remind us that it‚Äôs possible', 'GlamGoddes101 I agree that it wasn‚Äôt the intention of #girlboss but it does seem like a result.', '@@GlamGoddes101 I disagree, I think that\'s entirely the message - in precise parallel to the model of ""success"" presented to men, but with added, um, issues.\nThe entire value system of capitalism is about rising up in the hierarchy of money, power, ""success."" This justifies the position of those in power as being, of course, the result of their being ""successful"" at whatever they did that got them there in the first place (never mind that in the vast majority of cases, it was successfully being born to a family with pre-existing wealth/power).\nThe entire point of ""aspirational"" messaging is not about ""empowering"" the viewer to rise in the hierarchy; it is the nature of hierarchies that the number of available positions on the higher levels is much smaller than on the lower, so there\'s only so many people who can be realistically ""empowered"" under any circumstances. Rather it\'s to keep us clawing and competing against each other for those limited spots, accepting the narrative that ""success"" is correlated with ""merit,"" and above all else never questioning the hierarchical arrangement in the first place.', '@@dwc1964 exactly!', ""Thank you well said. Like there so many people who don't really want to become rich but they want the attention or can't think for themselves. Its okay if you don't have the same dreams as someone else be genuine to you and what makes you happy. Just buy a house or land and live life how you want to. Geez everybody think they want to become rich and wealthy but don't know why.""]"

Yay Lindsey Ellis!!	[]
sad we‚Äôre getting less Chelsea, but love Lindsay‚Äôs new show!	[]
Keep that girl boss agenda on the hush otherwise you will attract mostly feminine let‚Äôs-split-the-bill type of men. Keep your goals to yourself and work in silence. Otherwise be old and lonely, or with a feminine man that could never protect you like nature intended. Idk who needs to hear this, but it‚Äôs ok to not always be so independent	[]

Princess Weekes? The Mary Sue got in there, too?	[]
I think the fallacy in this video is super common. We hear over and over again that we can do career or family. But as someone who wants to delay family until later in life and also doesn't give a fuck about contributing to capitalism as a source of meaning, I felt excluded. Ladies, it's okay to love neither - there are so many other things to love in life! For me I've found so much fulfilment in starting my own vintage reselling business (hardly a career, more of a hobby), making art, and spending time with people I love. Your most fulfilled life might not look like that, but there are many boxes to check outside of kids or work. (Obviously I get that those things demand our time, just saying we don't have to make them our main focus of value)	[]
Cheers for the Living Single mention!üòéü§©	[]
Thank you	[]
Love this! Great video and take on the term girl boss! I find the term cringe worthy!	[]
Women need to get out of the workforce asap. They're not suited for it emotionally, and worse it's cut wages in half. It takes two working parents to have the same level of household income only one parent did in the 70's, which is leaving children in the hands of babysitters, smart devices and worst of all the public school system. And that's not even mentioning the abysmal birthrates, too. Women on average, you're happier in the home! There's no shame in going back!	['are you an idiot? why are you blaming bringing women into workforce for cutting wages in half, this has no logical sense.']

"The real question is, where can I watch Living Single?? Cuz that is the kind of media I am HERE FOR.

Also, Lindsey Ellis is fantastic. A+ collab!"	['Katie Behrens All episodes are in Hulu', 'Omg I wanna watch it', 'Katie Behrens it‚Äôs a great show!!! Enjoy!']
Something I think needs to be added to this conversation is the value of family! Capitalism has told us that you're only valuable if you're monetarily valued, but actually I think we need to fight that too. I'm a woman who one day would LOVE to stay home and be a Mum... I don't think that is less valuable than being a #girlboss.	"['SAME. It took losing my job and taking myself out of the ""rat race"" for a whole year to figure out my true priorities to realize all of this. I mean... I knew these things already conceptually, but it took being unemployed (not by MY choice) to finally drive home the message. I\'m hoping to start my own business, do that for a few years, prove to myself that I can start something on my own and be semi-successful at it (success as defined by MY metrics) and then figure out a way to be a stay at home mom (I\'m currently nannying to pay the bills until my business is up and running, but the mom I work for is also a stay at home mom who\'s using the time I""m there  with her kids to start her own businesses). How cool is that? No reason why we can\'t be worthy and valuable in all phases of our lives.', ""Mothers and teachers are ESSENTIAL for us as a species. The fact that teachers are so underpaid and motherhood isn't seen as a job at all is what needs to be fixed. The solution to this macho culture is education! Teach boys the value of women and to appreciate the importance of a balance between rationality and sentimentality in both men and women."", 'Amen.', ""Maybe not, but if you live in a capitalist society it is a precarious position to be in, one that society seems to be fine with women being in. Don't work, don't save, just trust that he won't leave you high and dry. The fastest growing demographic of the Australian homeless population are older women, many of whom had broken or limited work history and who never got to build financial independence."", 'Yes! feminism means supporting ANY decision that women want to choose for themselves - whether that‚Äôs to be a stay at home, to go far in their career, or both, or entrepreneurship. I don‚Äôt understand why some people think that women choosing to be stay at home moms is a bad thing, like that woman is choosing to do what she WANTS to do and I‚Äôll support anyone who does what they know is best for themselves!']"

I feel like we glossed over the opportunity gap created by childbirth. Women loose time in the workforce with pregnancy and childbirth, that is a big factor in losing out on promotions	"[""Indeed.  Until we as a society make it easier for women to be gone on a (generous) maternity leave and still have a job to step back into when its over, we're going to keep having this problem."", 'or women being overlooked for positions in the first place thanks to employers being ""afraid to invest in them"" because they will just get pregnant and leave.', ""@@thatjillgirl I feel sorry for all women in America if you have this kind of problems, I have stabile work and I know if I ever get pregnant I will have support from my company and my government, I will have maternity live and I can't stop working before childbirth on sick-live to prepare my self, I will get pay, My and my baby have free health care I don't have to pay to give birth or for anything, if I will not choose private. Also after maternity live I can come back to my job and my position will be waiting for me because pregnant women and mothers are protected by low."", ""@@klaudiaw8518 Not all women in America have this problem, but it is completely up to their employer, so some do.  Since there is no federally mandated minimum maternity leave, it is up to each employer how much they will offer, for how long, and to which employees.  Many of us do get some paid maternity leave, but some women aren't given any or they don't qualify because they aren't full time."", ""@Elizabeth D I agree that the father should have the opportunity to stay at home with the child if it's necessary like for example when the mother has to go back to work or she just make more money then him. I don't agree that both of parents should be at home while the child is still a baby, he is not needed, it's better for men to work, for his mental sake but doesn't mean that he shouldn't help with the baby when women are tired or just want a break. Going back to maternity leave in the USA, to have equal rights and equal opportunities for pregnant women Government should make a low that all companies will adapt.""]"
"Half and Half was a spin off of Living Single ü§î

Appreciate the representation. Thank you."	['That blew my mind! Lol', 'She‚Äôs white üò≠ she at least tried', '@@thotcrimez4252 You might want to check who wrote this episode.', '@@thotcrimez4252 What does her being white have to do with anything. Half and Half was spin off of Living Single. Or at least in the same universe.']
Agee with much of this. Still think we could do with a lot less of the condescension and passive-aggressiveness on this channel.	[]
"One issue I have with this video is you're using a lot of TV shows and movies as examples of how things work in real life. Obviously that's not entirely wrong as media reflects life, but in many of those shows and movies what's actually being shown is the director/writer's vision, not what actually happens. 

Interesting video though, although it is not what I was expecting on TFD"	[]
I loved this! Can‚Äôt wait to see more.	[]
Can someone explain the thesis of this video essay? In the end you can or can't have it all? I feel stupid	"[""same, this video doesn't provide clear idea, so ot has no point"", ""@@LumosCreature ok, I'm glad someone feels the same way haha""]"
"California law is changing corporate board structure: https://www.sos.ca.gov/business-programs/women-boards/
Note: NO women existed on any public company boards when this law was enacted in 2018"	[]
This is very well researched!!	"[""That's Lindsay Ellis for you. She has a course on Skillshare about researching for videos.""]"
well-done!	[]
"Interesting point of view, but still leaning heavily on a lot of debunked facts. It's funny how people are now switching to ""Opportunity Gap"" now that the ""Wage Gap"" and ""Pink Tax"" have been thoroughly refuted for years.

Mentioning that women choose to take a stall in their careers in order to start or raise a family is important when talking about slower advancement. Pointing out that there are many more women in middle management rolls and management as a whole is also critical, while their are less women in both that upper CEO level AND in the lowest, bottom rung jobs. Recent studies show this is mostly intelligence driven; the average woman is more intelligent than the average man, the least intelligent men are less intelligent than the least intelligent females, but the smartest men tend to be more intelligent that the smartest females.

So you see exactly what you would expect. Men being the majority in the most unskilled, more labor focused jobs; women being the majority in mid-level jobs and most management positions, because both of those have lots of positions available. Then yes, men usually ""win out"" in those top of the food chain jobs because there are so few of them and its highly competitive, and there are more of them qualified enough for those jobs.

It's not an even playing field, but a meritocracy isn't supposed to be. We can try to do better on the springboard people start from, but people are going to turn out how they are, and there are biological factors to consider when you see who ends up where via macro trends.

Not saying the whole video is wrong or it's not worth watching/considering, but there seems to be an obvious slant/bias here."	"['A) where is the proof / source that men are peaking at higher IQ\nB) Success at a job is not really solely reliant on IQ.', ""@@munstergirl25 https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/study-of-1-6-million-grades-shows-little-gender-difference-in-maths-and-science-at-school-101242\n\nYou are correct on B. I don't have a particular source but the biggest contributing factors to job success seem to be Economic Privilige growing up and Luck.""]"
Interesting way to branch out the channel. I‚Äôm excited üòä	[]

I love Lindsay!!! üíûüíûüíû	[]
Whaaaa Lindsay Ellis on the Financial Diet! Was not expecting this when I clicked, what a great surprise!	[]
annnnnnndddd Lindsay Ellis does it again	[]
"I am usually very skeptical about the ""feminist"" approach, which most of the times seems to victimize women (saying that we are the victims because we do not have the same opportunities, even in those cases where we do) or to want to assert females over men rather than as peers, but I really liked this video. As Jordan Peterson says, studies proved that even when given the opportunity, less women took up leading jobs because we tend to have different expectations from life and different ideas of family compared to men: our instincts lead to nurture and care for others, but this should not mean that it is less valuable or useful in business, law or marketing. It is refreshing to see that there are alternatives, thank you."	[]
This is so good	[]
"LINDSAY SERIES?
I AM SHOOK"	[]
This was interesting!!	[]
"Lindsay: ""Hey guys, I'm Lindsay Ellis"" 
me: *liked* 

Seriously though, it's kinda tragic how any modern rich country can fall into the work vs. family dichotomy trap. As far as I have seen, the relationships and support you have in private are crucial to success if anything. So many even moderately successful women have the kind of supportive man behind them that can sadly be counted as extraordinary. Rich people pay to have housework done to save time. In my country, daycare became a major political issue in the 70's precisely because women can't usually work if it isn't available, and that's also a big reason to why split parental leave is so important. 

Few myths in the modern world are so dangerous as the one that one person can achieve anything on their own."	[]
One of my favorite representations of a girlboss in recent pop culture was the boss in The Bold Type. She was so realistic and clearly written by a woman. She had a family and was also invested in being a mentor to her employees. Love her! Miranda Priestly wishes.	['‚ù£Ô∏è ‚ù£Ô∏è ‚ù£Ô∏è Word', 'üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ', 'üëåüëå', 'Yes! Well rounded and balanced.', 'All the woman in that show are amazing.']
Ooo, what a cool topic! I can't wait for more.	[]
So happy to see Lindsay on TFD again!	[]
open question: which series/movies portray a woman boss in a healthy way?	"['Jacqueline Carlyle from the Bold Type <3', 'Working Girl with Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith and 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton are two of my personal favorite examples. They\'re both movies from the 1980s, but feel very ahead of their time in terms of how they approach girlbossing. Working Girl really dives into how business is very patriarchy oriented, and sexism dominates the industry. Tess (Melanie Griffith) initially looks up to Katharine (Signourney Weaver), who\'s like the textbook girlboss, but ultimately realizes that Katharine\'s approach to it is just as toxic as those of her male counterparts. Tess maintains both her ambitions and her ethics in the end and is rewarded for it (not to spoil the movie too much). 9 to 5 is a bit more power fantasy, since it focuses on three women who get to stick it to their terrible lecherous boss in a hilariously extreme way, but a huge theme of the film is the women learning that in order to overcome this unfair system, they have to work together, not pit themselves against each other, and a lot of why they become successful bossbabes is because they make the workplace a positive environment for the other women they work with, creating a system that makes it easier for them to ""have it all"" so to speak.', 'Oh, another good example is Carolyn Knapp Schappey, from the BBC Radio Series Cabin Pressure, which is just a cracking series all around', '@@elizabethkeller9261 the 9-5  movie was excelent!']"
This collaboration is a gift that keeps giving. <3	[]
Nice collaboration ^^	[]
Love Lindsay Ellis!  Great video.  To date, the best scene ever on (sorta) this topic...https://youtu.be/j35OrpeBU3I. Would love to hear Lindsay's thoughts on the ladies' roles in this movie (Late Night)...including the network exec.	[]

Fell for the girl boss meme for a while, was super depressed and unhappy. Now married and planning on my first child this year, and I‚Äôll be a stay at home mom for my fantastic husband ‚ù§Ô∏è couldn‚Äôt be happier. Don‚Äôt let media steer your interests	"['Violet Reichert no offence but you being depressed and unhappy is nothing to do with the job. And being a stay at home is not a formula to happiness.', 'Swathi Rao thats not the point at all lol. I‚Äôm saying that media pretty much never portrays being a stay at home mom in a good light and not to try and be a certain way just because you saw it in a movie,', ""Congrats on marriage and child. I'm a stay at home too, you should enjoy your free time there are people out there that will say negative things out of jealousy things like you need to fill your free time with a hobby or side business.. I've seen stay a home moms fall for the pyramid scheme all thanks to their peers jealous words. Ignore people."", 'That‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm happy for you. :)']"
Great video!	[]
perfect collab!!	[]
I absolutely love this with my whole heart	[]
This is the best collab!	[]
I already read the credits in the opening yet I was totally flabbergasted  because in that environment I just expected Chelsea to open and had to blink to recognize Lindsey. It#s a bit like Lindsey belongs to a different entertainment world, she can guest or cameo but suddenly the host, that was out of this particular world ;-)	[]
YAY LINDSAY!!!!	[]
"When you did the male/female comparison of home duties, and mentioned women are half the workforce now, you need to explore full time VS part time/casual work. I do the majority of the housework, but I work part time, my husband is full time. You'll find that is an extremely common factor making up the ""imbalance"". #stopthewaronmen"	"['Georgina Kaye people forget woman work less hours on average also. It would make sense women do most the house work (in most cases) because our work week is shorter than men‚Äôs on average. Doesn‚Äôt sound like equality to me if both parties are doing half the chores and one works 5-10 hours a week less.', 'In the Netherlands it is common that  parents work 4 days a week. This means that the kid only needs to spend three days in daycare or even less when grandparents also get to choose a day when they get the kid(s).  (Also there is no war on man, don‚Äôt you think it would be nice for men to if it is no longer expected of them to be the provider?)', 'Just because your story is one way, does not mean it is like that for all couples with children. In my household we both work fulltime, run my own business (no, not a blog, or etsy shop), and do most of the housework, not by choice. My partner struggles with the concept of my full plate, but that is in part due to his mother worked full time, and took care of her husband and kids. Come to think of it, my mother did the same - multiple jobs, dealt with school affairs and general parenting, etc. The ""If she can do it, why can\'t I"" attitude from his end has landed us in counseling. On the other hand, I have a few friends who work fulltime while their partner is a stay at home father. Or single dads that are flying solo when the mother completely checked out. And of course a few ""classic"" couple agreements for stay at home moms. I think bottom line is that what she said wasn\'t meant to be ""war on men"". Data is objective information, not a subjective attempt to slander or slam anyone. Some demographics are not like that, and it seems you are lucky enough to be in one where things are more balanced.', 'The mere fact that you work part-time likely means you have less of a chance at Promotion, etc.    And then you earn less now, less Pension later. If for any reason you  will not be with your partner to retirement, you\'re likely financially worth off. Part-time work to do ""free work"" at home is a sacrifice on your behalf and should be factored into an equal Partnership.     I agree that this works for some people, but for many women the societal expectation is pushing them to part-time roles without thinking through the full long-term impact']"

This is great, TFD has such intellectual, meaningful content. But so contemporary and relevant to today's 20-40ish bracket.	[]
"omg wtf 
its a good surprise tho"	[]
Fun fact: Friends(1994) is based on and heavily borrows from *Living Single* (1993).	"[""Friends is entirely a rip off from Living Single. The actors of Living Single voiced this along with the creator and if you watch Living Single and you also watch Friends, you'll see that most of the episodes in Friends are often a play by play of Living Single except whitewashed since it's a white cast. It's sad because if you try to find a good link online now to watch Living Single, you have to search so hard but Friends has become well known and awarded and is still easy to binge.  Just another case of racism."", ""Thanks for sharing this. I vaguely remember Living Single, but hadn't known that Friends stole Living Single's concept."", 'Lazy Reader living single is on Hulu', ""People really can't help but bring on Friends everytime they mention Living Single? Honestly it's lame. Friends was already in production, Friends had a classic and almost non-existent premise. Friends took off because audiences did so and America loved it. Friends went on to be ripped off by a lot of sitcoms after it ended. It's just how TV works, the premise is hardly the most original thing ever so it's insane to think a group of friends concept is supposed to be trademarked or something."", '@@sabrinafrni64 they liked it because of all white people']"
Did anyone else find the constant cutting into movies distracting?	"[""It's her style even in her actual channel."", 'nope', 'More interesting for me then to just watch her talk...']"
"The problem with the term #girlboss, #bossbabe, etc is that it has been taken over by the MLM ""huns"" shilling overpriced stuff people don't need or want on social media."

Lindsay Ellis?!?!?!	[]
You do recognize you're using ficticious writings to justify your opinions, right? Not that I disagree with what you are saying but removing your fiction based examples would likely do a lot for your argument.	"[""Sophia amoruso isn't fictional as far as I know?"", ""She's a media critic."", 'First of all, Lindsay Ellis is a film and TV critic, so she\'s in her lane (the title of this series is literally ""Pop Culture Portfolio""). Secondly, Lindsay explicitly says, many times, that women like Miranda, Dany, and Cruella are depictions of female power. These depictions are relevant because they at once reflect and drive nuanced conversation around elements of female power and how that conversation shifts over time and among different communities. Third, Sophia and Helen Brown are real women.\nThe #girlboss concept and hashtag was created and is perpetuated by media. Fictional media could not be more relevant to this conversation.', ""It's made very clear that she is talking about how women in power are depicted, using fictional depictions of women in power works quite well for that"", 'She used a real life example and also she‚Äôs analyzing media depictions of this trip because that is the goal of the series, hence the name.']"
