"REGARDING ""GIRL BOSS""/ FEMINISM- FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WOKENESS

Generally, i do NOT have any issue whether a character is ""BOSS"" or not irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, etc .... my PRIORITY is the story, good writing and implementation which includes without contradicting pre-established canon and lore for existing franchises.

For the example.... 

I find it quite odd that folks attack Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies for being  for pro-feminism wokeness yet the EXACT SAME FOLKS love and embrace ATOMIC BLONDE movie which is actually MORE WOKE pro-feminist above both Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies COMBINED.

Atomic Blonde is actually a better movie and many will agree on this yet it is MORE WOKE with *FEMALE EMPOWERMENT*.... Ask yourself why?!?

*Simple.... Because Atomic Blonde is a BETTER WRITTEN MOVIE even with its WOKE female empowerment-ism.*

EVERY MEDIA WE HAVE WATCHED THAT SHOWS A WOMAN DEFEATING A MAN IN ANYTHING IS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT and we have enjoyed many of them such as the KILL BILL movies. 

Some good and some bad.... Applies to ALL MEDIA doesn't matter if its woke or not. 

Atomic Blonde is NOT a perfect movie but still far better and more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels despite being more woke.

Breakdown....

(1) ....Atomic Blonde being able to tank direct hits from well trained MALE agents better than them without superpowers, no assistance or extra abilities makes her more woke than Captn Marvel +  The Marvels whose extra super powers makes her and them  (Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel, Photon) almost invulnerable which provides extra-boost protection from damage.

Atomic Blonde makes the case for women being able to fight trained male fighters in direct combat like in UFC, Muay Thai and Boxing or whatever combat sports which is what the  extremist feminists are pushing IRL.

*Compared to Captn Marvel + The Marvels movies*.....

....that makes the case that women can NOT match men in direct combat without physical augmentation/ extra powers to make the women more powerful.*  Remember the scene at the end of Captain Marvel where the male villain said...

 ...[paraphrasing]... Lets fight without the powers, switch them off and challenge me.... [Captn Marvel refused and instead BLASTED HIM with an energy beam].

The ""message"" here is brutally crystal clear.

 Atomic Blonde heavily implies that if women pushed hard enough (like extremist feminists are doing) under their own natural  strength and endurance without support or assistance  or NO augmentation or extra-powers of any kind... a woman can ass whoop multiple men SINGLEHANDEDLY in direct combat.

 This has been the case for the vast greater abundant  majority (not all) of female lead action movies which involves martial arts and combat.

*And yet Atomic Blonde is much more enjoyable and BETTER movie than both Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies (+ Madam Web) COMBINED despite Atomic Blonde being more woke* .....

This is because of the BETTER WRITING and proper execution of Atomic Blonde made it a better enjoyable movie. 

(2) ....MALE VILLAINS.

Have u also noticed....greater majority (Not all) of such female action movies and/or tv shows have MALE VILLAINS as the final big boss bad guy like in the Black Widow, Atomic Blonde and even the beloved KILL BILL movies amongst very VERY many others. 

This was *NOT* in the Captn Marvel movies (Captn Marvel + The Marvels) as i pointed out earlier whereby both had female villains as the final big boss bad guy in both films.

I know that the final big boss called ""Supreme Intelligence"" in Captain Marvel movie was an alien AI but note that it presented itself as a female form/ a woman throughout the Captain Marvel movie.

(3) .....The WOKE LESBIANISM/ GAY

Notice this in Atomic Blonde movie is literally with a full-on in your face lesbian gay sex scene.

Where was the anti-woke outrage for this?

 Notice how there is no heterosexuality in the Atomic blonde and the lesbo/gay love making is literally shoved straight into the faces of the audience.  It wasn't even subtle or hinted at or innuendo but rather full blast. 

Compared to Captain Marvel movies also did not have any heterosexuality/ male-female love story but it did NOT have any sexuality in it of any kind. Instead it focused on friendship and familial bonds between best friends. 

I have seen some folks online have said Captain Marvel movie had lesbo innuendo between Captn Marvel and her best friend but that's subjective opinion which many disagree with.



TO CONCLUDE ....

Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies had several problems steming from BAD WRITING but wokeness is not part of it. 

Atomic Blonde is a better written movie which is why its more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels.

I apply the same logic to the dumpster fire trash of SHE-HULK tv series and crap-fest SECRET INVASION . 

I enjoyed MOON KNIGHT, WANDAVISION and liked FATW (though i think it NEEDED more eps to be more satisfying but it was still good).

At the end of the day if wokeness is the sole blame for ""BAD WRITING"" then by that exact same logic means that non-woke content are ALL automatically 
awe inspiring and captivatingly superb....which is NOT true.

THERE ARE BADLY WRITTEN AND GOOD WELL WRITTEN WOKE AND NON-WOKE CONTENT IN EQUAL MEASURE.

Anyhow, don't watch what u don't like.....i also tend to do this

"in your comments regarding millennials and buying ethically.  I have noted in my activities that millennials do not seem to understand what ethically is.  They know the word and the feelings of self appreciation that comes with saying ""I am being ethical"", yet they fail to understand the why of ethics, what makes ethical.

I have engaged with multiple individuals in that age range that believe that they have the right to claim ownership on objects they copied.  One case was a scan of a physical copy of an old magazine they were reselling as a digital version.  The individual did not understand how it was unethical to profit on direct to sale of the product because they went though the effort to scan it.  the magazine in question was defunct so it was not illegal, only unethical.  There is a level of entitlement and denial there prevents them from seeing the mechanics that make ethics what they are as a generality.

You can blame this on advertising and the overused and abuse of the term to the point that ethics do not have any meaning to them, as they do not actually see ethical behaviour.  you can also blame that they have not been properly mentored.  You can blame it on hustle culture that teaches people get what you can and let the buyer beware.  In the end for whatever reason they do not understand actual ethics and unless it is branded as  ""ethical"" they can not determine it for themselves.  And when confronted on it they do not want to believe that they are capable of unethical behaviour.

There is a big issue with self image that prevents them from accepting ethics that borders on psychopathy.",[],2023-05-11T21:24:50Z,@hugsandcurses

My marriage was almost destroyed by this toxic outlet, as I viewed my husband as a competitor. I helped him start his company in exchange for him putting me through law school. In other words we nearly worked ourselves to death. My goal was to make more than him. Then came the typical fertility problems associated w/ endless work. By the Grace of God, I found out I was pregnant at my first 'hardcore' fertility consultation (infertility doc vs generic ob/gyne). My whole perspective changed the moment I heard the words, ""You're pregnant!"" I can barely write thinking about the joy that overcame me. THAT, was when I learned what life was really about.

"Women will never be government or business leaders. Their will be some but I doubt they ever break 30%. Why? Because men and women are different, what we want from work is different. Twice as many women graduate college than men also more resources and grants for women starting businesses, so why aren't twice as many companies and tech start ups started by women. Simple cross culture and across time one simple rule of human nature, women are judged by their looks men are judged by their status. For men grinding mean ls more and better mates, more respect. Women can be the smartest, richest, most successful person on the planet, it will have very little impact on happiness on mate selection, respect from community. As a man what a women dose for a living has absolutely no affect on if I want to date them. I cant remember what any women ive dated for last 25 did for living, i did not care at all. For woman what a man dose for a living is one of the most important factors. So what happens women climb that ladder and realize working 60-70 hours a week is no fun and other than bank account has not given them what they want, which is usually family, friend and community. Men will work 60 hour week and not think twice about it, he will get a sense of accomplishment, his wife will thank him for providing. Ladies do you want to work 50-60-70 hours a week so your husband can stay home with the kids? Or do you want to be home with the kids? Seriously think about it.","['Another point ""Ban Bossy""?

We see time and time again the drive behind bosses and CEOs is to screw over everyone for power and money. No male was standing in the way of the female fashion CEOs and these women sht on everyone in sight. If you had a female CEO in your company, do you think she would stoop down to your level and help you level up? Power is power, and absolute power corrupts no matter what your genitalia or pronoun. With 60% of college graduates women, and if you\'re a graduate, look who you\'re up against. Did you pick a profitable major like STEM or did you doom yourself to low pay as a teacher or social worker? Men who want to make money certainly avoid those professions.

"Sophia Amoruso is absolutely not someone to look up to. I appreciate her initial 'hustle' in forming Nasty Gal but she stepped down from her company rightly so because she fired pregnant employees and was clearly a toxic 'girlboss' (the term itself and hustle culture is awful, the book also is so narcissistic and self glorifying), how can you have shame to try to build a half-arsed 'feminist foundation' after treating women in the workplace terribly and then selling the company to a fast fashion brand, even writing a book glorifying yourself. I guess she was trying to save face with this slap-dash 'foundation', to try and hide why her company failed and the mistreatment of women under her leadership. It's still now well buried and not much talked about that the mismanagement of her company was mistreatment of women and disregard for womens' rights in the workplace, the irony of it all. 'Girlbossing' didn't work for her, and lead to her company being bankrupt, so we should look to successful women who empower other women as role models. This shows her morals, treating her employees and fellow women terribly and happily supporting pollution of our planet - though I'll give her the second one as I'm not sure how much control she had in selling the company, though I'm sure it was a lot. 'Ambition, resilience and hard work' she claims she had on her terms involves stepping over everyone and flying morals out the window for money. Her energy is very much like Kim Kardashian and Molly Mae's tone deaf comments, only difference is Sophia 'got away' with it more because it was 2017.",[],2023-01-11T06:08:18Z,@linuxducky

But the whole ""ban bossy"" campaign was so ham-fisted and cringey right from the start. I remember at the time thinking I agree with the sentiment, but this isn't really starting any productive conversations about how we use language to talk about women in leadership. It just generated a lot of backlash and hate online.

And it's not surprising at all that nearly all of these are just riddled with racist controversies.

"Going on a rant here. I'm a female healthcare startup co-founder/CEO, only woman in the entire startup. I've realized a few things through my journey.
1) Gender/identity doesn't matter but talent does. People can be assholes regardless of their gender/identity.
2) Most founders and investors want to help women founders as much as they can. Literally, no one will benefit if we keep whining about lack of opportunities.
3) The burnout after ""hustling"" for years is crippling. You need to be creative as an executive and make unique decisions. You can only accomplish that if you have clarity of thought. There is no room for clarity of thought if your schedule is jam-packed. 
4) Being an entrepreneur is lonely. It's no where near as glamorous as what everyone portrays it to be.

"It's important to note that most of these self-proclaimed 'girl bosses' are women who started their own business _so they've been the boss from the get-go..._ that's a very different perspective to have than someone who works their way up to being the boss, like Sandberg's corporate POV.  And what Sandberg says is true - if there were more women in high-level positions in govt & corporates there would be more diversity - but it's for different reasons than this 'girl boss' idea promotes.  

The primary reason there are less women as you go up the corporate ladder is that the roles become less flexible & more demanding, so when women reach a level where their priorities change they are forced to choose between career & family... the closer to the top that decision happens, the more diverse the overall business tends to be because _it normalises a different way of working_ (which is beneficial for men as well as women).  But make no mistake... women are just as capable of being ruthless & insensitive to get to those executive roles!",['No its systemic misogyny üíÄ'],2022-07-11T15:29:28Z,@medea27

"I hate hussle culture, I would love to start my own businesses but as a former employee never would I have wanted to work more to please my boss or my companie's goals.... no one should ever expect that from people, we have a right to live and have time to be happy lol. Secondly, those are NOT girl bosses, I personally like the term because it is really much harder for women and more generaly anyone that is under privileged to make it as far as rich white men. That's a fact. I've educated myself a lot about the impact of mysogynie on us, to the point that men interrupt women 60% of the time, when women, only once, and that impostor syndrome almost only  targets women. Men have a tendency to over evaluate their abilities, intelligence and skills whereas women diminish themselves so bad. They will talk down about themselves and won't try to ask for a raise but in general men will much easily claim to have skills they don't even have, ask for much more money and feel entitled. I've read the comments and no, I think there is a BIG difference between male bosses and girl bosses. Men have role models everywhere, even in movies, most of the richest people on earth are men, but women, no matter their colour are almost non existent in positions of power because of mysogynie. There is a huge difference in the hardship and the journey to achieving this status, because men are privileged (white ones) but women are under privileged, so imagine if they are black and/or disabled or mothers omgg.... So the goal of creating an inspirational vibe is really cool, but actually it's all marketing by narcissistic people that juste happen to have a vagina, (+ cis, traigt and white lol) so they feel entitled to the girl boss game... to me this is and shouldn't be a representation we should have of women entrepreneurs, these are just bad people, greedy, racist, with no moral ethics, just like the rich straight male CEO( I mean most of them).",[],2022-05-25T23:24:11Z,@Blabou
"Wow... In 2016, I started a company selling a service for a larger company. Kind of like a franchise. 2017 we barely got our feet wet, doing like $2K worth of business. I built a website from the ground up and managed everything, in 2018 I had figured out advertising and we did $30k in business. 2019 was poised to triple that. But somewhere in the middle of 2018, another person showed up wanting to do what we were doing. They had been a sponsor site previously, but the HQ decided, that even though they would be competing directly with me, to let them move forward. This company (""F"") was run by a woman and the wife of the owner of the parent company (""S"") was all about girl power. So they gave ""F"" precedence over my already established company. The problem was, ""F"" was riding the coattails of my advertising. She wasn't making any new content or pushing the service, simply sitting back and waiting for calls. I began to see a decline in our numbers and had several students opt to go to ""F"" classes because it fit their schedule better (They were already signed up with us and would have taken the course if no other option was available).  I tolerated this direct competition since we were in different cities. But then a second company ""C"" owned by a woman, popped up, right in the middle of our territory. Despite my best efforts, I could not convince ""S"" at HQ to cease the competitive nature. So now I, a man, who had taken an opportunity to grow the parent company's brand was being told to play nice with outright competition because ""We need more women in these fields..."" The stress was too much. It went from something I loved doing to absolute chaos. So I closed up shop in early 2019 and told the parent company ""good luck"". Several of the staff at HQ quit over the debacle and both of the competing companies have effectively disappeared. I know one has a class every month but never has any students. All because they thought there was a demand for the product so there was plenty to go around, but I had spent money to advertise and grew a demand. Once my ads had stopped nobody even knew the company existed. Women are a great asset to many businesses, but when you try to posture your company with female employees so the optics look good, you are not helping anyone. Before those women started their businesses to compete with me, they were in positions to make money from my company as sponsors and instructors.  It hurt to wallk away, but I am glad I did it when I did, COVID may have made that competitive situation exponentially worse.",[],2022-05-24T18:49:09Z,@jasonthephoneboy

"I think that stuff that start out as ""Come, join our cause, become something special"", if it actually succeeds in attracting people, it'll automatically become a selling point, and turn into a commercial tool.
It's like that feminism was used as a means of selling cigars to woman... To make them feel more ""empowered"".
Terms and ideas don't change the world, actions do... And the casual action of corporations, is to convince the masses to buy whatever they are selling.

The whole ""We are green"", ""We are inclusive"",  ""We are supporting the poor"" or even ""We are a religious/traditional business""... It's all just one big way of saying ""Buy because nonsense"".

And it works... Time changes the words according to what trends, the items and concepts are the same - ""Give me money and power"".

Trying to push women into fields that most women aren't terribly interested in (STEM) and never being happy that the number of women pursuing these fields remain lower than men. Shocker.
Not to mention the relentless push for women to chase careers at the expense of their families. Tell women to go make lots of money and pay some strangers (typically other women) a paltry wage to take care of THEIR kids. Just contributes to the further breakdown of relationships starting with family, then society at large.

"Growing up my dad was in the military. My mum had a college education and career plans. Two years into marriage she had me....followed by five more. With six kids in tow, a husband who was often deployed, a dog and moving cross country every 1-4 years. My mom made the choice to be a stay at home mom and homeschool us. She wanted us kids to have some kind of normalcy and provide a grounding force in the middle of ever-changing environment. She also wanted there to be consistency in our education. Yes does she fall into the Leave It to Beaver female stereotype. 

But as she said being a girl boss is presented as this one ideal thing. Which equals material gain. 

No one would probably look at my mom and think she's a girl boss. But the lady gave birth to six kids, 1 on her own, raise us herself, with a deployed husband, in states that we knew no one in, educated us. Looking back I can't believe how much she gave up. The woman had zero time alone. 

She did this not for material gain, but so that her kids could have a somewhat normal life. She was even criticized for not being a 'feminist'. If that's not a girl boss. I don't know what is.","['Great comment! Your mom‚Äôs dedication to her/your family is amazing and this kind of STRONG and CARING woman is not recognized enough in the modern world.

While there she befriended several women who suffered mental illness along with their cancer diagnosis and stuck by them till she past on in 2015 when she was ready to see what God wanted her to do next. During all her personal struggles she had a positive and caring personality‚Ä¶ so grateful to have had her as my mother and mentor.

"See I think Sheryl was onto something when she said that more females being in a position of power was good for equality, but the problem lies within the execution. Using myself as an analogy, as a female going for a STEM degree, I would go into an exam room and at 4/5 (and more) of the room are males. What I'm getting at is you can help and ask and beg for someone to do something all you want, but the choice (most of the time) is ultimately up to the person. This goes for both genders. Females in the automotive industry and males in nursing (There's a whole askreddit forum dedicated to both. It's a really eye-opening perspective). They both face a lot of sexism and scrutiny. 
I've heard a lot of ""I'm bad at math so I'm probably going for [insert non math related major here]"" which is valid. I hate physics so I'm going nowhere near it. At the end of the day, one's occupation is molded by mindset and circumstances. What Sheryl can only do is help change the circumstances (scholarships,  grants, financial aid, housing, etc) but she can't force the mindset. Same goes with managing positions. I don't doubt that there are  women reject due to sexism, but I also believe a good portion of the female population isn't going for those types of jobs.

"As the incredible Camille Paglia says, we need to ""bring back biology"" in feminism. Many aspects of why there are less female CEOs and so on are due to biological differences between men and women, and less to do with sexism (or any other ism). Men and women tend to prioritize different aspects of life. The entire concept of feminism was to be thought of as MORE than a body; to be given choice in one's own future. Now, women who choose to stay at home (if they can) to raise their children (which could quite possibly be THE most important job in the entire world) are looked down upon and asked when they can get back into the work force. As if working outside of the home is vastly superior or more fulfilling to working inside of it? Women are THE consumer base for almost every product-we should use this power wisely and look at who truly gains when we spend our hard earned money so flippantly, like on notebooks that say GIRLBOSS when most of us are in massive student loan debt, working median income jobs, living alone in apartments and spending more than we save and invest.

"I actually think girl boss toxically morphed from the campaign to get young kids- girls to expand their minds & explore different opportunities & be empowered (studies show that gender dynamics start impacting girls as young as 10, getting them to either pull away from STEM because they feel like they can;t do it and/or because their teachers judge them poorly and provided less support despite similar levels of intelligence as their male peers). 

The problem I have with girl boss culture is the same as what I have with white feminism. It is not intersectional, very materialistic and thinks that large problems can be solved/fixed by simply having a woman incharge. Unless you fix structural issues and deal with the root cause of oppression you are simply doing a PR stunt.
