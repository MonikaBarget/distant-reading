"Surprise, having women adopt the same toxic attributes of the worst male leaders is just as bad and doesn't nothing to promote actual equality in the workplace.
""Girlboss"" is just another term invented by corporate suits to virtue signal they are doing something to promote gender equality without actually addressing the toxic environment that corporate culture encourages."	[]

"REGARDING ""GIRL BOSS""/ FEMINISM- FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WOKENESS

Generally, i do NOT have any issue whether a character is ""BOSS"" or not irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, etc .... my PRIORITY is the story, good writing and implementation which includes without contradicting pre-established canon and lore for existing franchises.

For the example.... 

I find it quite odd that folks attack Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies for being  for pro-feminism wokeness yet the EXACT SAME FOLKS love and embrace ATOMIC BLONDE movie which is actually MORE WOKE pro-feminist above both Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies COMBINED.

Atomic Blonde is actually a better movie and many will agree on this yet it is MORE WOKE with *FEMALE EMPOWERMENT*.... Ask yourself why?!?

*Simple.... Because Atomic Blonde is a BETTER WRITTEN MOVIE even with its WOKE female empowerment-ism.*

EVERY MEDIA WE HAVE WATCHED THAT SHOWS A WOMAN DEFEATING A MAN IN ANYTHING IS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT and we have enjoyed many of them such as the KILL BILL movies. 

Some good and some bad.... Applies to ALL MEDIA doesn't matter if its woke or not. 

Atomic Blonde is NOT a perfect movie but still far better and more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels despite being more woke.

Breakdown....

(1) ....Atomic Blonde being able to tank direct hits from well trained MALE agents better than them without superpowers, no assistance or extra abilities makes her more woke than Captn Marvel +  The Marvels whose extra super powers makes her and them  (Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel, Photon) almost invulnerable which provides extra-boost protection from damage.

Atomic Blonde makes the case for women being able to fight trained male fighters in direct combat like in UFC, Muay Thai and Boxing or whatever combat sports which is what the  extremist feminists are pushing IRL.

*Compared to Captn Marvel + The Marvels movies*.....

....that makes the case that women can NOT match men in direct combat without physical augmentation/ extra powers to make the women more powerful.*  Remember the scene at the end of Captain Marvel where the male villain said...

 ...[paraphrasing]... Lets fight without the powers, switch them off and challenge me.... [Captn Marvel refused and instead BLASTED HIM with an energy beam].

The ""message"" here is brutally crystal clear.

 Atomic Blonde heavily implies that if women pushed hard enough (like extremist feminists are doing) under their own natural  strength and endurance without support or assistance  or NO augmentation or extra-powers of any kind... a woman can ass whoop multiple men SINGLEHANDEDLY in direct combat.

 This has been the case for the vast greater abundant  majority (not all) of female lead action movies which involves martial arts and combat.

*And yet Atomic Blonde is much more enjoyable and BETTER movie than both Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies (+ Madam Web) COMBINED despite Atomic Blonde being more woke* .....

This is because of the BETTER WRITING and proper execution of Atomic Blonde made it a better enjoyable movie. 

(2) ....MALE VILLAINS.

Have u also noticed....greater majority (Not all) of such female action movies and/or tv shows have MALE VILLAINS as the final big boss bad guy like in the Black Widow, Atomic Blonde and even the beloved KILL BILL movies amongst very VERY many others. 

This was *NOT* in the Captn Marvel movies (Captn Marvel + The Marvels) as i pointed out earlier whereby both had female villains as the final big boss bad guy in both films.

I know that the final big boss called ""Supreme Intelligence"" in Captain Marvel movie was an alien AI but note that it presented itself as a female form/ a woman throughout the Captain Marvel movie.

(3) .....The WOKE LESBIANISM/ GAY

Notice this in Atomic Blonde movie is literally with a full-on in your face lesbian gay sex scene.

Where was the anti-woke outrage for this?

 Notice how there is no heterosexuality in the Atomic blonde and the lesbo/gay love making is literally shoved straight into the faces of the audience.  It wasn't even subtle or hinted at or innuendo but rather full blast. 

Compared to Captain Marvel movies also did not have any heterosexuality/ male-female love story but it did NOT have any sexuality in it of any kind. Instead it focused on friendship and familial bonds between best friends. 

I have seen some folks online have said Captain Marvel movie had lesbo innuendo between Captn Marvel and her best friend but that's subjective opinion which many disagree with.



TO CONCLUDE ....

Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies had several problems steming from BAD WRITING but wokeness is not part of it. 

Atomic Blonde is a better written movie which is why its more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels.

I apply the same logic to the dumpster fire trash of SHE-HULK tv series and crap-fest SECRET INVASION . 

I enjoyed MOON KNIGHT, WANDAVISION and liked FATW (though i think it NEEDED more eps to be more satisfying but it was still good).

At the end of the day if wokeness is the sole blame for ""BAD WRITING"" then by that exact same logic means that non-woke content are ALL automatically 
awe inspiring and captivatingly superb....which is NOT true.

THERE ARE BADLY WRITTEN AND GOOD WELL WRITTEN WOKE AND NON-WOKE CONTENT IN EQUAL MEASURE.

Anyhow, don't watch what u don't like.....i also tend to do this

Ive heard women of minority groups use girl boss plenty id say if you haven‚Äôt then you yourself are operating inside a specific demographic box. And  with that I‚Äôve also seen and heard of women pitching to end someone‚Äôs  success at heir reasons being different of course then just pure envy (look at any of the real housewives of ‚Ä¶. ). My only question is why don‚Äôt we have the same expectations and demands of minority women to include white women in there business‚Äôs. I mean they are allowed to cater specifically to themselves . My point being is if it‚Äôs accepted for one side side why wouldn‚Äôt it be for another side. Well bc it‚Äôs not right ,right? I mean how could your celebrate with out everybody. I just wonder why one group can be very vocal that they are only about themselves and it doesn‚Äôt raise an eyebrow. Yet other groups get called out for not feeling diverse enough? I think if these are the points we are going to argue everyone should have to follow the same rules. And honestly it would be a bad thing it‚Äôd really make everyone better. Don‚Äôt we all deserve to feel accepted where ever we want to to go ? Of course we do so let make it the standard we all follow.	[]

I need clear objectives, adequate resources, and professional courtesy. Courtesy, not friendship, not kindness, not concern, just courtesy. Women who are in positions of authority, have high expectations, and hold their subordinates to that standard, aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbossy.‚Äù They‚Äôre in charge, and we should submit to their authority or seek other employment.

"in your comments regarding millennials and buying ethically.  I have noted in my activities that millennials do not seem to understand what ethically is.  They know the word and the feelings of self appreciation that comes with saying ""I am being ethical"", yet they fail to understand the why of ethics, what makes ethical.

I have engaged with multiple individuals in that age range that believe that they have the right to claim ownership on objects they copied.  One case was a scan of a physical copy of an old magazine they were reselling as a digital version.  The individual did not understand how it was unethical to profit on direct to sale of the product because they went though the effort to scan it.  the magazine in question was defunct so it was not illegal, only unethical.  There is a level of entitlement and denial there prevents them from seeing the mechanics that make ethics what they are as a generality.

You can blame this on advertising and the overused and abuse of the term to the point that ethics do not have any meaning to them, as they do not actually see ethical behaviour.  you can also blame that they have not been properly mentored.  You can blame it on hustle culture that teaches people get what you can and let the buyer beware.  In the end for whatever reason they do not understand actual ethics and unless it is branded as  ""ethical"" they can not determine it for themselves.  And when confronted on it they do not want to believe that they are capable of unethical behaviour.

There is a big issue with self image that prevents them from accepting ethics that borders on psychopathy."	[]

"Girls - I'm a 57 year old 80's girl. This is just the same old life-sucking garbage they were pushing down our throats when I was in college '84-88. My marriage was almost destroyed by this toxic outlet, as I viewed my husband as a competitor. I helped him start his company in exchange for him putting me through law school. In other words we nearly worked ourselves to death. My goal was to make more than him. Then came the typical fertility problems associated w/ endless work. By the Grace of God, I found out I was pregnant at my first 'hardcore' fertility consultation (infertility doc vs generic ob/gyne). My whole perspective changed the moment I heard the words, ""You're pregnant!"" I can barely write thinking about the joy that overcame me. THAT, was when I learned what life was really about. He's 29 now and has two sisters. Family and love thereof, and the love of God.

Women will never be government or business leaders. Their will be some but I doubt they ever break 30%. Why? Because men and women are different, what we want from work is different. Twice as many women graduate college than men also more resources and grants for women starting businesses, so why aren't twice as many companies and tech start ups started by women. Simple cross culture and across time one simple rule of human nature, women are judged by their looks men are judged by their status. For men grinding mean ls more and better mates, more respect. Women can be the smartest, richest, most successful person on the planet, it will have very little impact on happiness on mate selection, respect from community. As a man what a women dose for a living has absolutely no affect on if I want to date them. I cant remember what any women ive dated for last 25 did for living, i did not care at all. For woman what a man dose for a living is one of the most important factors. So what happens women climb that ladder and realize working 60-70 hours a week is no fun and other than bank account has not given them what they want, which is usually family, friend and community. Men will work 60 hour week and not think twice about it, he will get a sense of accomplishment, his wife will thank him for providing. Ladies do you want to work 50-60-70 hours a week so your husband can stay home with the kids? Or do you want to be home with the kids? Seriously think about it.	"['Another point ""Ban Bossy""? Someone calling you bossy is what is holding you back? If being called bossy is to much for you, then being the boss is now the job for you. I am a team lead and have employed people. I get call @$$hole all the time. Being CEO and competing in the world is a mean cut throat place. No amount of mean words is going to change that.', ""Man repealer clothes? As a man this really makes me angry. Fashion is an industry that actually has alot of women in it. More white women and gay men per capita than any other industry. Blue collar guys are not making decisions about clothes. But then there is this ad clothes for women by women. It already is and has been for decades. Men we don't go shopping we don't know anything about fashion, you do ladies. Fashion is a woman world but somehow men still get blamed.""]"

About to watch this and I suspect it to be the saddest video of them all. Seeing as how the wage gap thing is a big issue, thus, we all want women to succeed and beat the system that was created to keep them down and control them for no logical reason whatsoever. But I also know plenty of male CEOs fail and pretend they‚Äôre not failing until it boils over in the news. It‚Äôs possible there are just more male CEOs in general so more are failing and no one makes a big deal out of it (i.e. them going to court over it isn‚Äôt a big news story unless you‚Äôre Facebook or Amazon‚Äôs CEO) because there may be so many male CEOs out there.	"['""we all want women to succeed and beat the system that was created to keep them down and control them for no logical reason whatsoever"". Elizabeth Holmes was funded primarily by men to startup a medical company after she dropped out of college. Doesn\'t fit what you said. \nHow does the existence of one more female CEO benefit you personally? We see time and time again the drive behind bosses and CEOs is to screw over everyone for power and money. No male was standing in the way of the female fashion CEOs and these women sht on everyone in sight. If you had a female CEO in your company, do you think she would stoop down to your level and help you level up? Power is power, and absolute power corrupts no matter what your genitalia or pronoun. With 60% of college graduates women, and if you\'re a graduate, look who you\'re up against. Did you pick a profitable major like STEM or did you doom yourself to low pay as a teacher or social worker? Men who want to make money certainly avoid those professions. The elite purposely have you (and me and most everyone else) fighting the wrong fight - women against men, when it\'s we the people vs the elites - this is that these male and female elites want to you to forget about.']"

I honestly find it bizzar how people often overlook that  white feminist viewpoint can exclude those of other intersections of identity. I'm a South Asian woman who is Muslim by faith and I just don't relate to white feminism. My cultural upbringing whilst living in the UK and also getting to grips with faith lead me to have an identity alien to white feminism. I realise that white feminism often uses 'inclusive' as just women but ignored other intersections of identity and the way it creates further nuances in how people interact, especially in the workplace.

Sophia Amoruso is absolutely not someone to look up to. I appreciate her initial 'hustle' in forming Nasty Gal but she stepped down from her company rightly so because she fired pregnant employees and was clearly a toxic 'girlboss' (the term itself and hustle culture is awful, the book also is so narcissistic and self glorifying), how can you have shame to try to build a half-arsed 'feminist foundation' after treating women in the workplace terribly and then selling the company to a fast fashion brand, even writing a book glorifying yourself. I guess she was trying to save face with this slap-dash 'foundation', to try and hide why her company failed and the mistreatment of women under her leadership. It's still now well buried and not much talked about that the mismanagement of her company was mistreatment of women and disregard for womens' rights in the workplace, the irony of it all. 'Girlbossing' didn't work for her, and lead to her company being bankrupt, so we should look to successful women who empower other women as role models. This shows her morals, treating her employees and fellow women terribly and happily supporting pollution of our planet - though I'll give her the second one as I'm not sure how much control she had in selling the company, though I'm sure it was a lot. 'Ambition, resilience and hard work' she claims she had on her terms involves stepping over everyone and flying morals out the window for money. Her energy is very much like Kim Kardashian and Molly Mae's tone deaf comments, only difference is Sophia 'got away' with it more because it was 2017.	[]

Also Girl Bosses: ""So yeah, we can't have plus sized women or people of color in our ads because it messes with the brand, and anyone who isn't the same color as us is inferior and we hate them.""

"So many of these ""girlboss"" trends start from the smallest nugget of truth. Like the ""ban bossy"" thing. Are assertive women more likely to be called ""bossy"" than assertive men? Yes. But the whole ""ban bossy"" campaign was so ham-fisted and cringey right from the start. I remember at the time thinking I agree with the sentiment, but this isn't really starting any productive conversations about how we use language to talk about women in leadership. It just generated a lot of backlash and hate online.

And it's not surprising at all that nearly all of these are just riddled with racist controversies. It just makes it so blindingly obvious ""girlboss"" was just a term to launch branding and empower very specific women (many of whom already had wealth and power). And they had zero intention of actually opening any doors for anyone else."	['This is right on the money. Pun intended']

"Going on a rant here. I'm a female healthcare startup co-founder/CEO, only woman in the entire startup. I've realized a few things through my journey.
1) Gender/identity doesn't matter but talent does. People can be assholes regardless of their gender/identity.
2) Most founders and investors want to help women founders as much as they can. Literally, no one will benefit if we keep whining about lack of opportunities.
3) The burnout after ""hustling"" for years is crippling. You need to be creative as an executive and make unique decisions. You can only accomplish that if you have clarity of thought. There is no room for clarity of thought if your schedule is jam-packed. 
4) Being an entrepreneur is lonely. It's no where near as glamorous as what everyone portrays it to be.

I want people to work with me or fund my startup because they resonate with our mission to make healthcare accessible. Not because I'm a young, POC, female immigrant founder. I find this identity bs really offensive to my intellect."	[]

"It's important to note that most of these self-proclaimed 'girl bosses' are women who started their own business _so they've been the boss from the get-go..._ that's a very different perspective to have than someone who works their way up to being the boss, like Sandberg's corporate POV.  And what Sandberg says is true - if there were more women in high-level positions in govt & corporates there would be more diversity - but it's for different reasons than this 'girl boss' idea promotes.  

The primary reason there are less women as you go up the corporate ladder is that the roles become less flexible & more demanding, so when women reach a level where their priorities change they are forced to choose between career & family... the closer to the top that decision happens, the more diverse the overall business tends to be because _it normalises a different way of working_ (which is beneficial for men as well as women).  But make no mistake... women are just as capable of being ruthless & insensitive to get to those executive roles!"	['No its systemic misogyny üíÄ']

I hate hussle culture, I would love to start my own businesses but as a former employee never would I have wanted to work more to please my boss or my companie's goals.... no one should ever expect that from people, we have a right to live and have time to be happy lol. Secondly, those are NOT girl bosses, I personally like the term because it is really much harder for women and more generaly anyone that is under privileged to make it as far as rich white men. That's a fact. I've educated myself a lot about the impact of mysogynie on us, to the point that men interrupt women 60% of the time, when women, only once, and that impostor syndrome almost only  targets women. Men have a tendency to over evaluate their abilities, intelligence and skills whereas women diminish themselves so bad. They will talk down about themselves and won't try to ask for a raise but in general men will much easily claim to have skills they don't even have, ask for much more money and feel entitled. I've read the comments and no, I think there is a BIG difference between male bosses and girl bosses. Men have role models everywhere, even in movies, most of the richest people on earth are men, but women, no matter their colour are almost non existent in positions of power because of mysogynie. There is a huge difference in the hardship and the journey to achieving this status, because men are privileged (white ones) but women are under privileged, so imagine if they are black and/or disabled or mothers omgg.... So the goal of creating an inspirational vibe is really cool, but actually it's all marketing by narcissistic people that juste happen to have a vagina, (+ cis, traigt and white lol) so they feel entitled to the girl boss game... to me this is and shouldn't be a representation we should have of women entrepreneurs, these are just bad people, greedy, racist, with no moral ethics, just like the rich straight male CEO( I mean most of them).

"Wow... In 2016, I started a company selling a service for a larger company. Kind of like a franchise. 2017 we barely got our feet wet, doing like $2K worth of business. I built a website from the ground up and managed everything, in 2018 I had figured out advertising and we did $30k in business. 2019 was poised to triple that. But somewhere in the middle of 2018, another person showed up wanting to do what we were doing. They had been a sponsor site previously, but the HQ decided, that even though they would be competing directly with me, to let them move forward. This company (""F"") was run by a woman and the wife of the owner of the parent company (""S"") was all about girl power. So they gave ""F"" precedence over my already established company. The problem was, ""F"" was riding the coattails of my advertising. She wasn't making any new content or pushing the service, simply sitting back and waiting for calls. I began to see a decline in our numbers and had several students opt to go to ""F"" classes because it fit their schedule better (They were already signed up with us and would have taken the course if no other option was available).  I tolerated this direct competition since we were in different cities. But then a second company ""C"" owned by a woman, popped up, right in the middle of our territory. Despite my best efforts, I could not convince ""S"" at HQ to cease the competitive nature. So now I, a man, who had taken an opportunity to grow the parent company's brand was being told to play nice with outright competition because ""We need more women in these fields..."" The stress was too much. It went from something I loved doing to absolute chaos. So I closed up shop in early 2019 and told the parent company ""good luck"". Several of the staff at HQ quit over the debacle and both of the competing companies have effectively disappeared. I know one has a class every month but never has any students. All because they thought there was a demand for the product so there was plenty to go around, but I had spent money to advertise and grew a demand. Once my ads had stopped nobody even knew the company existed. Women are a great asset to many businesses, but when you try to posture your company with female employees so the optics look good, you are not helping anyone. Before those women started their businesses to compete with me, they were in positions to make money from my company as sponsors and instructors.  It hurt to wallk away, but I am glad I did it when I did, COVID may have made that competitive situation exponentially worse."	[]

I think it's important for people like Amarouso to keep in mind that just because you're good at running a small or even mid-sized e-shop, being good at sales, is not the same skill set as  being ceo of a major corporation who has tons of employees and brand deals and manufacturing and shipping concerns. She could have gained those skills if she hadn't blown up so big and run with it, but it really sounds like she in particular collapsed because at the end of the day she just didn't have the know-how to manage the growth.

It's like that feminism was used as a means of selling cigars to woman... To make them feel more ""empowered"".
Terms and ideas don't change the world, actions do... And the casual action of corporations, is to convince the masses to buy whatever they are selling.

The whole ""We are green"", ""We are inclusive"",  ""We are supporting the poor"" or even ""We are a religious/traditional business""... It's all just one big way of saying ""Buy because nonsense"".

And it works... Time changes the words according to what trends, the items and concepts are the same - ""Give me money and power"".

No one is changing the world, they just make the masses believe they do."	[]

Also, being called a ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù is so insulting and belittling. It‚Äôs absolutely NOT a positive term. It‚Äôs just this never ending vicious cycle of brainwashing women into thinking they need to work HARDER, encouraging them to cheat, steal, manipulate, lie, and even ostracize friends and family. Over the years I‚Äôve noticed with these kind of women influencers that they feed this lie to all women about ‚Äúdon‚Äôt settle‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be content with where you‚Äôre at‚Äù, and it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. What‚Äôs attractive and admirable about a woman is her ability to be humble, to be content with what she has (referring to #girlboss greed), kind, compassionate, and also confident in who she is!

Start up ‚Äòculture‚Äô unfortunately is inextricably linked with ‚Äòfake it till you make it‚Äô.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you for doing this video. And pointing out that women are people too and do the same messed up stuff that other people that happen to be men do. 
I'm a regular guy that's been sick of this crap (extremes of women's empowerment) for over 10 years. A bunch of grifters and suckers following them, to include the federal Gov't workforce with their never ending obsession with ""diversity and inclusion"".
Trying to push women into fields that most women aren't terribly interested in (STEM) and never being happy that the number of women pursuing these fields remain lower than men. Shocker.
Not to mention the relentless push for women to chase careers at the expense of their families. Tell women to go make lots of money and pay some strangers (typically other women) a paltry wage to take care of THEIR kids. Just contributes to the further breakdown of relationships starting with family, then society at large. It sucks that we've walked down the path that make two income households a requirement for most couples. And for the record, no, I'm not suggesting women just sit at home and be household slaves."	[]

"Growing up my dad was in the military. My mum had a college education and career plans. Two years into marriage she had me....followed by five more. With six kids in tow, a husband who was often deployed, a dog and moving cross country every 1-4 years. My mom made the choice to be a stay at home mom and homeschool us. She wanted us kids to have some kind of normalcy and provide a grounding force in the middle of ever-changing environment. She also wanted there to be consistency in our education. Yes does she fall into the Leave It to Beaver female stereotype. 

But as she said being a girl boss is presented as this one ideal thing. Which equals material gain. 

No one would probably look at my mom and think she's a girl boss. But the lady gave birth to six kids, 1 on her own, raise us herself, with a deployed husband, in states that we knew no one in, educated us. Looking back I can't believe how much she gave up. The woman had zero time alone. 

She did this not for material gain, but so that her kids could have a somewhat normal life. She was even criticized for not being a 'feminist'. If that's not a girl boss. I don't know what is."	"['Great comment! Your mom‚Äôs dedication to her/your family is amazing and this kind of STRONG and CARING woman is not recognized enough in the modern world. My mother was very much the same - she gave so much of herself to her family as well as volunteering with developmental adult‚Äôs WHILE battling cancer for 35 year‚Äôs (several reoccurrence‚Äôs). She was awarded the 25 year‚Äôs of volunteering with the cancer society as well! While there she befriended several women who suffered mental illness along with their cancer diagnosis and stuck by them till she past on in 2015 when she was ready to see what God wanted her to do next. During all her personal struggles she had a positive and caring personality‚Ä¶ so grateful to have had her as my mother and mentor. I work supporting developmental adult‚Äôs and as a private mental health support (and part time musician). I know whatever life throws at me I will strive to face it with her strength and attempt to keep compassion for those I cross path‚Äôs with. \nThank You for sharing!', ""What a beautiful comment, I'm sure your mom would cry if she read it.""]"
"Everyone is making fun of Elizabeth Holmes' voice being fake... Is it though?
Because of all things, I am less concerned about her fake voice but rather the fake claims she made about her company. 
I know women I grew up with who already had really deep voices in their teens, I don't think it's so unlikely she really talks like that. Maybe she has voice damage. Do we really need to stoop so low to make fun of that about her, of all things?"	[]

I find is rather irritating these ‚Äú girl bosses‚Äù making it seem to regular women that they are so rare due to some sort of oppression. It‚Äôs statistics. Women are simply not interested in politics to that degree, nor are they interested in being CEO‚Äôs  and that is largely  due to biological clock  eventually pulling them home. Not saying women can‚Äôt be whatever they want to be its just science. Then there are women like me who are in a child free marriage and tell men to eat sh!t and die if they get in my way in work place and that works just fine. I feel zero oppression.  You can do whatever you want you don‚Äôt need these women to dictate how that works.	[]

Back in the 50s auto insurance companies automatically charged young men more than young women because men had more accidents than women. That was because the men had the cars. As more women entered the workforce they were found to be just as reckless as men   The same is true of women in management. They can be just as avaricious and exploitative as men. Time to look beyond gender and consider competence and real accomplishments	[]

Plus, women have been part of the power hierarchy for some time, nothing indicates they are any different then men in a competitive environment."	[]

"A true ""girlboss"" wouldnt label herself with that.  She'd just be a boss.  Who happens to be a girl.  She wouldn't need to brag about it and bitch at people.  She wouldn't need to scam and hustle and harass.  She'd be a boss, she'd be good and passionate, and she wouldnt need to brag.  Same usually goes for most things regardless of gender.  If you are something, you usually dont have to go around advertising it to people."	[]

Men in my male-dominated field and Jordan Peterson always say 'well women don't get ahead because they have kids or have different interests'.  That's true in some cases, but I left due to backlash, and was fired for reporting porn in the workplace anonymously (I only reported it to my union, without them knowing, but they figured it out since I was the only woman out of 12 men).   There is gatekeeping, but it's easier, like everything pertaining to male violence, to chalk it up to women's behaviour.	[]

These girl-bosses get way too much attention from millenials. On one side millenials have such a good selfesteem, often a good education and a good start in life..... but on the other side, lots of them are so vulnerable to the commercialised social media and so often copying from others and actually coming across rather hysterical. Please calm down, take one step at a time, be honest to yourself and your collegues, don't fake, just do your very best and have patience. Is making lots of money, having lots of stuff, botoxing away every wrinkle really important? Lead a balanced life and eat healthy.

"See I think Sheryl was onto something when she said that more females being in a position of power was good for equality, but the problem lies within the execution. Using myself as an analogy, as a female going for a STEM degree, I would go into an exam room and at 4/5 (and more) of the room are males. What I'm getting at is you can help and ask and beg for someone to do something all you want, but the choice (most of the time) is ultimately up to the person. This goes for both genders. Females in the automotive industry and males in nursing (There's a whole askreddit forum dedicated to both. It's a really eye-opening perspective). They both face a lot of sexism and scrutiny. 
I've heard a lot of ""I'm bad at math so I'm probably going for [insert non math related major here]"" which is valid. I hate physics so I'm going nowhere near it. At the end of the day, one's occupation is molded by mindset and circumstances. What Sheryl can only do is help change the circumstances (scholarships,  grants, financial aid, housing, etc) but she can't force the mindset. Same goes with managing positions. I don't doubt that there are  women reject due to sexism, but I also believe a good portion of the female population isn't going for those types of jobs.

It drives people away from the idea of ethical purchasing because ""oh, these former companies led by women who advertised themselves this way were bad, so why take a chance on a company like this?""

Seems to me that society is willing to give women leaders a pass in hopes that it will become a thing rather than looking to those who have sacrificed and built their experience over time. Though not a fan, Ursula Burns comes to mind. Whitman, Fiorina (though her tenure was mixed to put it generously) are others. What of Condoleeza Rice - Russian expert, concert level pianist, secretary of stat, and not a 'personality? It seems it all stems from shortcuts to riches. Ikea was started by selling garden tools out of a shed. Even 'evil' Amazon and Microsoft were started in garages and took years to build. Windows wasn't made until 10 years in and 4 years after it's founding, Microsoft only had 13 people employees including its founders. So much for MLM, this required expertise.These folks were not multi-millionaires in their 20's. There are no shortcuts.	[]

Hustle culture is actually quite old. Especially in America. It just takes new forms and identities in every generation	['Well said!']
"As the incredible Camille Paglia says, we need to ""bring back biology"" in feminism. Many aspects of why there are less female CEOs and so on are due to biological differences between men and women, and less to do with sexism (or any other ism). Men and women tend to prioritize different aspects of life. The entire concept of feminism was to be thought of as MORE than a body; to be given choice in one's own future. Now, women who choose to stay at home (if they can) to raise their children (which could quite possibly be THE most important job in the entire world) are looked down upon and asked when they can get back into the work force. As if working outside of the home is vastly superior or more fulfilling to working inside of it? Women are THE consumer base for almost every product-we should use this power wisely and look at who truly gains when we spend our hard earned money so flippantly, like on notebooks that say GIRLBOSS when most of us are in massive student loan debt, working median income jobs, living alone in apartments and spending more than we save and invest.

I cant wait until we get done with all of this woke shit, especially with gender and race. We just need to realize that we are all people. I have heard the most racist and sexist shit lately from people thinking that they are fighting for good and changing the world. Oh, by the way, I am a straight white male. If you read that last part and judged me and became angry, then you are part of the problem. We are just making the same mistakes and repeating them over and over and over and over again. Just work hard, be a good PERSON, and treat other people like you would want to be treated. We all have to work together as much as possible. No one is better than any one else. And that means EVERYONE! Get over yourself and eat the same shit sandwich of life that we are all eating and deal with it.	[]
This is actually a really good video and you do an amazing job with your research.	[]
Racism seems to be the common denominator here.	[]
I follow the beliefs of ‚ÄúBaby Boss‚Äù which is pretty sweet. You have employees spend all their time cleaning up your messes and buying the stuff you want. Sometimes you gotta eat peas or make tough life decisions like ‚ÄúDo I like dinosaurs or Barbie?‚Äù A baby boss says ‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù	[]

"The running theme is American white women. As Bill Burr would say when white women complain about white men as in societal power structures. B***h, you're in the hot tub with me. They get the same if not more benefit. These would be the same type asinine women who took or stole #metoo from Tarana Burke. 
Its no lie that these women would all say they were liberal and progressive and also full of isht! Maybe except for Nasty Girl founder as she was young with early success. Sheryl is just corporate doing corporate misdeeds so par for the course. 

As Fromm would say, ""the higher up the social ladder you climb the more vicious the mask you wear.""

"The intentional homogeny of the ""girlboss"" so-called movement is one reason why the term ""white-feminism"" exists.

"While Elizabeth Holmes deserves any punishment she gets, you have to admire the audacity of what she did.

And everyone just believed her and gave her money."	[]

"Lesson is we can only ""empower"" ourselves, we can't rely on anyone else to do that for us."	['Do you think  anyone would encourage and empower men. Aside from our parents and close family members or friends no one does. I guess you can argue we don‚Äôt need it. But we‚Äôre human just like everyone. we make it because we empower ourself.  We don‚Äôt have the media and politicians on our side to give young boys encouragement and motivation we have to find that ourselves. Actually my whole life I was used to being looked out on for being a man I‚Äôm hearing girl power this and that. We‚Äôre actually put down and we still succeed I can‚Äôt tell you how much Misandry was thrown in my face in school and in my adult life I just ignored powered on I gave those words no power. Women will find power when other peoples words don‚Äôt affect you when you encourage yourself']

The Holmes trial isn‚Äôt going to well‚Ä¶ I was rooting for her and still think she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. A bunch of idiots gave her money without doing research it‚Äôs their fault if you ask me. She might have lied but it feels like a Robin Hood story. She was stealing from the richest people in the world and tried to use that money to change the world. She ultimately failed but I still think she tried. It was a means to an end. I don‚Äôt feel bad for rich billionaires loosing their investments. I hope she isn‚Äôt found guilty.	[]
"Bruhv‚Ä¶ as a woman, I never bought in to the girl boss trend because something always seemed sketchy about it to me. It always seemed like something kitschy  and also novel. The people that associated with it or when ever i saw it felt so demeaning and patronizing. It‚Äôs synonymous with ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù in my opinion. The idea of women creating real change, but not doing anything meaningful and only slapping a catchy label onto it. It‚Äôs like like running around in circles in the patriarchal playing field.

More female (and other minority) representation would be important to change the narrative and ultimately the toxic, exploitative system by introducing other points of view than the traditional, ego-driven corporate culture created by men. What has been happenning though is the narrative and the system stayed the same, but a lot of women were convinced that by subscribing to the same toxic, inhumane hustle culture and cruelty emblematic of male executives, the nominal success they achieve is meaningful change. It isn't. It's just manipulating women into believing that the opportunity to work yourself to death while exploiting others means progress because you are female while doing it.	[]

Thank you for putting this video out. I am sad that  these women who are in leadership positions soiled the girl boss term. I proud myself as a boss babe boss mom and see myself a girl boss because I work my butt off to be where I am today and also because I am grateful to have helped women and men as I came up in the company. Men and women like these need to do better in being role models especially when you‚Äôre taking people money. There are great leaders out there. I now need to work 100x harder because irresponsible leaders don‚Äôt put their people first.	[]

I feel like this culture so heavily ignores how hard it is for women who want a family and how much strain this hustle culture puts on relationships. If everyone is hustling but also wants a family, something is going to give. We can't do it all, and that's not a character flaw. I don't think this is a gender specific issue, either. No one can do it all. We can't take care of ourselves and work 900 hours in one week. We need more quality of live improvements in the US, and we could impliment those immidiately without disrupting the system. Moreover, they'd improve the efficicency of the capitalist system anyway all while helping everyone. 40 hour work weeks aren't actually productive. Our current school schedules aren't good for students. We do not need to overthrow the system to overcome these problems. I really believe we could improve our lives next week, and not just for families though that's where my personal interests lie.	[]

"Is it weird that there is a part of me‚Ä¶. A teeeny tiny part mind u, but a part none the less that thinks, ‚Äúwelp, some women made it into the game. The whole game is terrible, but some women made it there into the terrible too!! Equity in awful, you go girl!‚Äù Sometimes I wonder (no often I know) , maybe the goal is terrible? Maybe the system is the problem? So if women succeed in the system they have to b awful, not bcuz the men aren‚Äôt just bcuz the only way to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù (Forbes list succeed) is to be awful. 

‚Äú‚ÄùEquity in awful‚Äù u go girl bosses! ‚Äú"	['Yeah I understand where u are coming from tbh like when your friend does something which is bad by the morals of the outer world but they totally slayed or won doing that thing lol ! üíÄüò≠‚ÄºÔ∏èüíÖüèº']
"I actually think girl boss toxically morphed from the campaign to get young kids- girls to expand their minds & explore different opportunities & be empowered (studies show that gender dynamics start impacting girls as young as 10, getting them to either pull away from STEM because they feel like they can;t do it and/or because their teachers judge them poorly and provided less support despite similar levels of intelligence as their male peers). 

The problem I have with girl boss culture is the same as what I have with white feminism. It is not intersectional, very materialistic and thinks that large problems can be solved/fixed by simply having a woman incharge. Unless you fix structural issues and deal with the root cause of oppression you are simply doing a PR stunt. Like that political cartoon that says ""and the next ones will be sent by a woman"" (while depicting people who are being bombed due to anerica's endless racist and imperialist history
)."	[]

Due to the FAKE voice & BS invention , Elizabeth Holmes is reprehensible. Her TOTAL lack of regard for all those ppl SHE put in danger, it's infuriating! What she did is SO dangerous! And she's just prancing around town livin the dream! The sound clip of her on a radio show is a must listen. You can hear her drop that ridiculous fake voice for a moment then she catches herself.	[]

As a father of daughters, it terrified me, when I learned how girls prey on girls. I wanted to get involved and provide some security, but my daughters told me that they were in a different world and there was nothing I could do.	"['Yes it must be heartbreaking for you as her protector that you are helpless in this regard. However this is her journey, let her slay her dragons and attend to her if her emotional hurts and wounds. Just do that and she will emerge the other side if not a winner then atleast a survivor, learning valuable lessons along the way.', ""I'd argue that you can still help. The behaviour of those women is nonetheless human behaviour. Its not unique to women to be agressive in that way. Teaching your daughters how to be firm in their personal values, how to communicate well, how to negotiate, how to set goals and build their boundaries will help them go a long way when dealing with both men and women."", ""@@mr.ambientsounds1291 I think it much more prevalent in girls. I was not aware of the dynamic, until my sister and older daughter told me about it. Guys will bully, but it is is less personal and doesn't involve the level in psychological manipulation which turns a girl's entire support system against her. Guys can work out of it by establishing cred through sports or other activities. With girls, it seems like once you are marked by the alpha girl, you have no recourse. I couldn't advise on the issue, because I had zero experience with it. My older daughter tried and failed to protect her sister, and it scarred both of them. My older daughter said there was nothing she could do but support her after damage was done."", 'You can still help. Just by being there for your daughters and having a strong connection where they feel safe, encouraged, and valued by you will show them to expect this in men, thus they will turn away from situations where men could put women to compete against each other for their attention because they know they deserve better based on how they learned a man should treat them. By keeping a good/understanding connection with them ur basically helping them learn self value and that goes a really long way in determining what people go through and what not in life', 'Providing plain old support consistently does a lot to protect people from exploitation because they can afford to leave exploitative situations']"
