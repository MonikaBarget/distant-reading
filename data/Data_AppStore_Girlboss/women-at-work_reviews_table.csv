That‚Äôs not the case with Women at Work. I enjoy this show so much! The topics are engaging and thoughtful, and the hosts do a wonderful job of really digging in to the nuances of what it‚Äôs actually like to be a woman in the workplace. 

Thank you for your research and efforts. I am truly a fan, and I would recommend Women at Work to any woman, whether she‚Äôs working in an office, at home, or is a stay-at-home mom. It‚Äôs nice to feel like someone else has your back, and sometimes, a mentoring career woman with more experience than you is really helpful. I‚Äôd also recommend this podcast to men, because let‚Äôs be real: men could use a LOT more insight into the issues women have to deal with in the workplace.
