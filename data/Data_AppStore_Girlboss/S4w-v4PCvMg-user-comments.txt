Love it	['Happy to hear this :)']
Simply divine ♥️	['👍', '@@lewishowes I’d love to meet her. Can you help me? 🙏🏻']
Soooo underrated..... Lewis, call her again, please @____________________@	[]
Her proudest moment is when she bought Nissan 😂	[]
Ya I agree about the chemistry between these two. It is effortless! They seem to not even realise lol. Sophia is great I love her chill	[]
Making your pitch through others is a good advice. Thanks for that. She is so cool. She didn’t come prepared for an interview and gave her story and a few advice. It’s great 👍 Thanks for sharing how both of your grades were, I struggled too. It feels good because every one is telling me how a masters degree will help you more than knowledge. I am an asian and in the market here it adds to getting promotion and a good reputation. It’s hard to convince elders that degrees don’t run your life.	[]
how are yo doing ? good .	[]
HER SKIN IS FLAWLESS .	[]
Turn damage into a strength 💥✨⚡️	[]
♥️Sophia! Girlboss Foundation! ♥️	[]
Thank you so much! As a huge fan of #GIRLBOSS the book and show it was wonderful to get to know Sophia and hear more of her story. She is such an inspiration on so many levels and you really helped her share her life, philosophy and her inspirations with us. I enjoyed every second and I never watch videos longer than a few minutes, LOL.	[]
I really like her strong personality and how she sticks to her authenticity no matter what.	[]
She has a very inspiring story	[]
thank you for this great interview!	[]
Love her!	[]
AWESOMEEEEEE INTERVIEW!!!!	[]
"Your story is so empowering, I literally get a lil info and then I get to working on my music!!! 
I love you, thank you so much!
Hope you can listen to my music <3 https://soundcloud.com/linapastel"	[]
Lewis giving her heart eyes lol	[]
Love this and her! thank you for this interview!! :)	[]
This is one of the main reasons why I really respect, admire and trust Lewis Howes; he is extremely transparent.  Who else would admit to not being able to read until 16, and that he cheated on all his exams?	[]
Love That Girl!!... I so can I identify with Sophia's story... Im pretty sure we a related somehow. lol  I first learned of Nasty Gal from Success Magazine.  Very Cool Story	[]
Great job with all your videos!! I love your content and what you've got going here	[]
What is she doing now? I heard Nasty Gal filed for chapter 11 in Nov 2016, but got bought out is she still designing for them?	[]
My goal in life is to be as calm and collected as this woman. Wow	['Watch the Netflix show on her 😂']
Love her and the book!	[]
"""I don't really talk about being a girl that much in it."" It's in the title..."	['Mary N *IN* is an abbreviation for *inside*']
I'm just watching this now and am so interested to see what she is going to do in the next year or two after all the disintegration of Nasty Gal and the show Girlboss only running one season.  I know that she has something next-level within her and I'll definitely be watching to see what happens.  Great interview btw.	[]
Great interview. Girl Boss is a fabulous show...disappointed there won't be a season 2. I can totally relate having been a street vendor in Montreal in the early 90's. I just love her fierce attitude and kind heart. TKS Lewis. 🙆	[]
Lewis Howels are you dyslexic? I am	[]
amazing	[]
Amazing video i learnt a lot ☺️	[]
START at 45:00.	['Hahahaha thank you']
Wow, she's really pretty	[]
amazing inspiration	[]
She seems so annoyed at him in the end 😅	[]
i miss the show	[]
She is gorgeous, smart and inspiring ❤️ loved The interview	[]
I need to get her book and yours too! Need to check if it's in my country , Philippines!	[]
Bloody iconic that's what she is	[]
Love this women! Always stay honest and real x	[]
You interviewed with all my fav! :) #Girlboss  Nice interview!	[]
Wow-awesome-thanks to all involved:)	[]
Wow it's amazing how she is like me in so many ways, the similarities are almost scary...	[]
What a great interview!	[]
After reading and watching GirlBoss, I started looking for Sofia on YouTube because I was curious as to how really is in real life, and how much liberty Netflix had with her character/personality. She seems so much more mellow and low-key in her interviews than the TV show character XD	"['Yeah, I was not a fan of the show myself. It pandered to some millennial ideal of the go-getter that ALSO gives no fucks, to the extreme. It was annoying and unfamiliar to me, an original Nasty Gal customer so...', 'I agree though at times i have heard her say things during interviews that i could hear coming from the “tv sophia”... i do like the show though', 'She was 22 when she started her brand. She admits she was really rude and self-centered at that time. The show is one of my favorites personally.', 'Jeca Martinez Art same girl same', ""I have watched the whole series many, MANY times and I think if you put Sophia together with a more conservative Annie they were true to who she was. We are multifaceted so that was an interesting choice. I love the show. It's gotten me through some of the worst moments of my life. Girlboss forever.""]"
this talk deserves a way more views. good job and keep the good work up!	[]
totally agree about how messed up education is in the west, not the kids that are the problem...tbh many have realised this and taken their kids out of school and home schooled...kids have become successful and integrated just fine etc	[]
":( Nasty girl is bankrupt now,

cant believe it since i love the book"	"['chickiewidie How come?', ""Is it because after she's handover the CEO to someone else?  Oh no"", 'chickiewidie She has other business now and she sold Nasty Gal xx']"
for someone starting from scratch with not a lot of education, she really understands what it means to be a boss. my boss has his company for 20 years and we are a team of 15 people and he isnt really understanding his different sections of his company or knows his people. am so impressed with her. you indeed need to be an expert in many things	[]
"You guys should get married and make hot and successful baby-outlaws.
Lewis: copy this msg and ask her out."	[]
Nice questions!	[]
I need to get her book	[]
I love how their books are also like face to face haha	[]
Good questions!	[]
I love love love this video two of my favorite influencers + Ohh My goodness the chemistry between you two was on another level.. 🙌🏻	[]
33 lol	[]
She's bankrupt now, right?	"['suvariboy shes worth 280 million the company she made her money from she sold years ago......smart woman', 'king koala --   Not true, according to Forbes. ""All told, she is likely to have a few million dollars in the bank from her book advances and sales, personal appearances, and Netflix deal, as well as investments outside of Nasty Gal.""\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/11/11/as-nasty-gal-files-bankruptcy-founder-sophia-amorusos-fortune-decimated/amp/', 'king koala you are stupid as fuck lol']"
I love all of your videos. I cannot believe I have only heard about you few weeks ago. Your videos are inspirational	[]
She keeps saying she's an introvert but from her Netflix series I think she's an ENTP	"['They made her character extremely extra for the show lol', ""Astral Cosmos Celestial the Third yes and ENTPs often need more time to process information compared to other extraverts, so they often mistype themselves as introverted. I'm an extravert but I can't stand large social gatherings and pointless outings. I think it comes from a misconception rather than how they wrote the show."", ""Ah, I just looked up ENTP, I thought it was just an abbreviation somehow for extrovert but yeah, I agree now that I know. It says on wikipedia ENTP's tend to be good at generating ideas but not following through with them. That sounds like her.""]"
interesting that she's an introvert and has an extrovert playing her in her netflix show	"[""would be kinda boring watching 13 episodes of an introvert's life, wouldnt it? Netflix has to spice it up, overexaggerate personalities. but yeah, it is funny""]"
Such an awesome interview! Really love the content of the interview and makes me aspire to think and be more motivated and driven like Sophia. Thanks for sharing!	[]
Love this lady! Our youth reflects! Not quite our business lives yet, haha -  Awesome chemistry ;)	[]
Found this very interesting!! Great interview	[]
*NETFLIX*	[]
Thanks for the great advice! I always love everything Sophia has to say, I can really relate to her!	[]
i have her book!	[]
great interview!	[]
I love when successful first dates are filmed :)	['They would be so cute together! Total power couple as well :)']
Lewis your questions are always amazing.	[]
omg thank you for making these videos I LOOOOVE Sophia and Gary vaynerchuck they give me so much inspiration and confidence to go after my passions and hope <3	[]
I love all this interviews! Please keep the good work going! :D	[]
just bought her book waiting for delivery lol	[]
Listened to the Chase Jarvis 30 days of genius with Sophia and listening to this one was a nice compliment to that video. I like how real and raw she is-- no bullshit, just honest convictions and straight up helpful/applicable advice. I love hearing stories of people who are completely themselves before their success and all the way through the process and even though they are just regular people, what sets them apart isn't where they came from but where they went from that point. People like Sophia--they hustle, do their best, show up each and every day and do the work. There are no shortcuts, just shifting perspectives and playing smart with clarity, vision, and heart. Thanks Lewis for another great video!	[]
"""What is netaporter?"" hahaha. Loved Sophia's horror that you didn't know!"	[]
If i were him, i will invite her a coffee.	[]
Lewis, hopefully you'll see this: If you haven't already, please please please watch the documentary Most Likely To Succeed about disrupting our outdated, bullshit education system. You'll love it! (As would Sophia!) And you should totally get the creators on your podcast to discuss further.	[]
your interviews rock	[]
"Thank you for mentioning GOODWILL!
Our retail stores fund our CAREER SERVICES and create great ENTREPRENEUR opportunities for people with the HEART and HUSTLE like Sophia.

GIRLBOSS!!

I wrote a paper about you and your company back in 2010 and no one believed me that you were going to BLOW UP!

Thanks for not making a liar out of me :)"	[]
sophia amoruso rocks.	['Lewis Howes i know sophia is a great businesswoman.']
Nasty Gal filed for bankruptcy...	['Janetmouse she sold it good exit strategy for her']
41:03 - 41:35  hilarious! but, don't get me wrong. she's totally smart & funny & inspiring.	[]
Amazing Interview, Read her book one of the best I've read, Keep it simple and keep showing up biggest take aways, Thanks Lewis! #DudeBoss #GirlBoss #SchoolofGreatness	[]

quintessential woman!!	[]
Girlboss was such an empowering read. Go Sophia!	"[""Hi Odi,funny to come across your comment here on Lewis Hewis' video some 2 years ago :D, I'm also your subscriber Odi 👍🤠""]"
"Love the banter and the chemistry between you two, and her ""unaffected"" and self-embracing demeanour. This interview really inspired me to lean into my individuality in a way that'll support and inspire the collective, and to embrace being a boss."	['I dont see the chemistry from her to him, but I can tell he is definitely inspired by her success...as opposed to her which is something she needs to watch out for...I hope to see her in some kind of philanthropy in the future...good job xo']
Her teeth! my godddd!!!!!!!!!! PERFECTION	[]
I never heard of her before, but loved the interview,  I will be buying her book for one of my female friends who is starting her own business!	[]
Great Video!	[]
Overall good interview and you tried to keep it flowing but few times she brought things up and then didn't want to talk about it.	[]
thank you Lewis for listening to your heart and helping people	[]
thank you...its hard to keep showing up sometimes. Its greatness indeed to be able to live to our truest intentions after years of falling down and getting up again and again.	[]
Great podcast! Loved her book as well. She's a tough cookie for sure.	[]
My nigga Lewis was flirting hardcore lol	['Finally someone said sth😂', 'Where?', 'they would be  a nice couple !!!', 'no, she needs to find a super nice guy....and whoever it is has to earn her...screw that ....guys think they can get girls whenever they want however they want...i dont think so lol', 'Alex Milosev Plus Shane cheated on her. Idk if thats real though lol, its from the netflix show.']
so inspiring! Love your podcasts	[]

That was a great interview.:)  Love this, i have read the girlboss, and it was the first real motivation book that caught my eyes, and my attention, so enjoyed to see who was behind the book. I love the part where both you where talking about how fails and past mistake dont necessary make the person, but build the character of the person want to be.	[]
