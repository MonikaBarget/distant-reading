"Making your pitch through others is a good advice. Thanks for that. She is so cool. She didn’t come prepared for an interview and gave her story and a few advice. It’s great 👍 Thanks for sharing how both of your grades were, I struggled too. It feels good because every one is telling me how a masters degree will help you more than knowledge.

"After reading and watching GirlBoss, I started looking for Sofia on YouTube because I was curious as to how really is in real life, and how much liberty Netflix had with her character/personality. She seems so much more mellow and low-key in her interviews than the TV show character XD","['Yeah, I was not a fan of the show myself. It pandered to some millennial ideal of the go-getter that ALSO gives no fucks, to the extreme. It was annoying and unfamiliar to me, an original Nasty Gal customer so...', 'I agree though at times i have heard her say things during interviews that i could hear coming from the “tv sophia”... i do like the show though', 'She was 22 when she started her brand. She admits she was really rude and self-centered at that time. The show is one of my favorites personally.', 'Jeca Martinez Art same girl same', ""I have watched the whole series many, MANY times and I think if you put Sophia together with a more conservative Annie they were true to who she was.

She keeps saying she's an introvert but from her Netflix series I think she's an ENTP,"['They made her character extremely extra for the show lol', ""Astral Cosmos Celestial the Third yes and ENTPs often need more time to process information compared to other extraverts, so they often mistype themselves as introverted.

"Listened to the Chase Jarvis 30 days of genius with Sophia and listening to this one was a nice compliment to that video. I like how real and raw she is-- no bullshit, just honest convictions and straight up helpful/applicable advice. I love hearing stories of people who are completely themselves before their success and all the way through the process and even though they are just regular people, what sets them apart isn't where they came from but where they went from that point. People like Sophia--they hustle, do their best, show up each and every day and do the work. There are no shortcuts, just shifting perspectives and playing smart with clarity, vision, and heart.
