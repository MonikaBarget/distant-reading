"My issue with the female character's they've dished out recently isn't at all that they're female. It's that they're bad characters. I can and have named 50+ female Star Wars characters who are well-received by the fandom, some of whom are vastly more popular than their male counterparts. Look up a tier list of SWTOR companions, and almost every class will have female characters at the top of their respective lists. Vette, Ashara, Mako, Kira, Jaesa, Elara, Lana, and Senya are all fan-favorites and tend to be rated higher than the men. Furthermore, many women from the game who aren't companions or romantic options have whole forum posts detailing why they should be. Darth Acina, Rylee Dray, Thana Vesh, etc. 

But that's just videogames and nobody cares about videogame characters. Nerds hate the female movie characters. Right? Well... Leia has been beloved since 1977, and she stole the show from both male leads the moment they met her. Mon Mothma was the leader of the Rebellion (See: The Good Guys) since 1983 and I never heard any fans calling for her removal. Padme was introduced as the queen of a matriarchal garden world so prosperous that the Trade Federation chose it as the location of its blockade to force the Republic to concede on tariffs in the region, and she only became more influential and badass over time, yet it wasn't Natalie Portman who received enough undeserved vitriol online to ruin her career; it was Hayden. I'm not sure where Disney got the idea that nerds hate women, or at least that they could convince people of it, but it's easily the most absurd take I've seen or heard in decades. Nerds love women.

"I think what some people forget to realize. Is that the comic book industry even to this day is mostly male-dominated. So even back in the day the girl bosses were created and written by men. The comic book industry much like the movies is catered towards a male audience. In other words males writing for males and that's why it worked. When you take a male genre and then switch it up with female leads, directors, writers, so on and so forth it loses its poignancy and its audience. I know this sounds misogynistic and sexist. I'm not trying to be either. I'm simply stating a fact as I've come to understand it after years of comic book collecting and comic book movie watching. As the critical drinker stated, movies made by women for women do good just as most material written by women targeted towards women does really well. Of course you have your exceptions like JK Rowling's and Harry Potter for example. Something's crossover and does really well with both men and women. And for the record men aren't opposed to the girl boss I mean look at aliens and aliens with Sigourney Weaver.

As a guy I went to the barbie movie with some friends when it came out. I didn't find everything in interesting but there was some funny stuff. I do agree with most of this. I like a lot more of the sci-fi/ medieval fantasy /Mecka series. There are people who find the opposite genres related to the demographics very interesting as a guy I am very into romance but I'm also a heavy action fan and I prefer romance more when it's blended as a subplot then a main plot. I also like protagonists from a male perspective more cause I'm a guy. I'm also sick of seeing the male protagonist that can't do anything or the male protagonist that starts off incompetent and learns how to do something it happens a lot on the male spectrum in books especially and it's quite annoying and overdone.,[],2024-10-29T15:51:42Z,@ewantube4555

"I really love how the Avatar novels (the Kyoshi and Yangchen duologies) handle the concept of “OP women”. 

In the Kyoshi novels, Kyoshi has a lot of raw earthbending power but no precision. She can throw boulders all day but she can’t bend small rocks pretty much at all. This poses an issue for her in her very first scene, and later on she accidentally disintegrates a precious keepsake with her uncontrolled earthbending. There’s even a scene where someone close to her is killed, where it’s implied she could have prevented it if she had more precision over her bending.  Kyoshi is technically OP, and it’s impressive, but it comes at a huge emotional cost for her.

In the Yangchen novels, Yangchen is portrayed as a bending prodigy. We meet her when she’s about 16, and she’s already made a name for herself defeating powerful enemies with her bending. But in this case, Yangchen’s real enemies are politicians and greedy merchants, who she can’t just whack around with airbending. Yangchen can’t use her “OP-ness” to solve this problem because it would have huge political consequences for her. So she has to copy their strategy and become a sneaky, manipulative, politically savvy Avatar. She has to become what she hates for the good of the world. 

These books prove that you can make an “OP” female protagonist and still have it work, as long as you put her in situations where her overpoweredness will actively hinder her. It’s all about creativity and logical consistency.",[],2024-09-24T14:16:37Z,@Hoodie_HD

The problem with girlbosses isnt that they are just badly written, or that they push the blatant political agenda, the problem is that the writers, the directors or the showrunners have a tendency to use their political stance as a shield to disingenuously defend their terrible works and lacklustre skills, simultaneously hoping to call upon people of similar political persuasion to mindlessly help with the defence online and get plenty of free publicity that they hope would translate to eventual ticket sales.

"The 10% of males who attend romance movies are trying to get laid. They're not there for the story. LOL.

But you are SOOOOOO correct! I'm a tomboy. Always have been. I enjoy action movies, sci-fi, military fiction, and suspense... with strong MALE leads and strong female leads when they make sense. Sure, women in those movies as a protagonist is an added bonus, but the main thing they need to reflect the target audience of the women watching them, specifically tomboys. Tomboys who aren't there to tear down the patriarchy. The ""patriarchy"" are our best friends, the people we hang around the most. Stop emasculating them! Stop making them the ""bad guy"" for standing up and doing what men do... fight bad guys to protect the people they love. 

The thing I hated the most about the last 3 Star Wars movies were: Poe being treated like an idiot and discredited or ignored when he was clearly a good leader, Luke turned into a total pansy instead of the GREATEST Jedi of all time, Kylo's terrible character arc making him whiny and unenjoyable, and Rey being a Mary Sue!",[],2024-08-30T14:31:27Z,@angiedavery

"It's appalling how in 21st century we still conflate femaleness with femininity. Femaleness is simply being a woman, in all her shapes and sizes. Doesn't matter what she wears and how she behaves, she's a woman through and through. Femininity is a man-made construct, a kind of cage to put women in and force into a premade role, behavior and looks, eg. long hair, frilly dresses, softness and naivety. That's BS.  That's not what women are like and who they are, that's what YOU want them to be. Sucks but we don't care.

Now ladies, some of what these failed abortions called males are saying IS true, there's no going around it.

If possible, learn which herbs and chemicals can make a moid sleep forever. Aqua Tofana, anyone? They are not called The Great Equalizers for nothing :0 no moid is immune to those, foolproof. They bleed just the same :)

Don't worry about not looking feminine or fckable to these semenal demons, that's what this backlash is all about. They don't want you strong, muscular and independent because that thing between his legs doesn't get up if you are, no, they want you to be scared, helpless but looking absolutely eye candy to them.

We now know that movies and media cannot completely change people into something they do not want to become. In the 80's, there was a lot of talk about the lack of female role models in movies and literature. Most women were depicted as weak, supporting and supplementary to their male counterparts. Some were even kind of useless for the hero and mostly a comedic relief or nuisance such as Willie in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

Well, because unlike other romances, I imbue my female characters with traits that men find appealing in romance like emotional empathy, the ability to recognize faults in themselves, and the willingness to take risks for someone that matters to them.

"I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy. I was def on the Oppenheimer side. I also greatly enjoyed Dune 1 and 2. Bene Gesserit are hella badass. Before that I went to see Napoleon, kinda meh. Cinema is expensive - I'll generally only spend money on epic movies that trully benefit from the big screen.  Oh, and I'm also a woman.

These movies do not have me as an audience. They do not interest me at all.
What makes me mad that they're so obviously pandering, instead of actually developing female character. Writers obviously only have surface knowledge of the material and hold no love for it. Just as an example with Marvel - why not tell the story of young Freya for a female character or young Hella and how war and hatred twisted her into a villian. If you want a gender-bending sex for anyone or anything - make a Loki movie. He's cannon shape-shifter that ocassionally gets pregnant.

Why the hell go for female WH40k female custodes. You could go for a badass sister story, or a psyker. Or again if you want a gender ambigous character make a story centered on the mechanicus. The fans would be happy and the non-fan audience doesn't know what they don't know.

Also it makes me unhappy when they erase social inequalities. For me sci-fi and fantasy have always been also a philosophical playground. A place where you can explore humanity vices and ethical what ifs, without the backlash of putting it into our real world and all the historical baggage that comes with it.

"They don't want to put the puzzle piece in place because it refutes the core argument of their political ideology. That is, ""where men are overrepresented, its because its an all boys club and they discriminate against women"". It is societies obligation to NEVER question ""maybe men are better at some things than women"" or ""maybe men have different preferences than women"", because if that is allowed to be legitimately considered, it will be shown as true, and much of their political activism would quickly be understood to be dogma and not scientific at all.

 These activists also hold to their core that women are JUST BETTER than men, and will never self-reflect to examine why they think so, or how much they are forcing discrimination against men in order to try to prove this. The people who make stories centered around men, while often fantasy, are much more in touch with reality. Men have to work extremely hard to succeed, and even male super heroes dont get free rides. Whereas these political activists are out of touch with reality and have very few real life examples of things like women dying in coal mines, or losing everything in a divorce, or actually facing extreme poverty and fighting to survive without significant help from family or activist policies. The ""male fantasies"" are generally based on actual experiences men run into, and have real life examples to draw inspiration from. These political activist fantasies do not, but their core premise is that ""women are just better than men"", so they feel the need to show women doing fantastical things that typically only men ever achieve, and doing so with easy or little struggle.

 This is where the Mary-Sue trope actually comes from - desiring reality to push one's political agenda when it does not. A  Male Mary-Sue basically never happens in a serious context - because it is so out of touch with reality that it can only occur as a comedy, like One Punch Man, or The Tick.

 The nerdy/gamer audience tends to be in opposition to the self-declared altruistic social activists who always seem to coincidentally only be activists for causes that benefit themselves or their political perspectives in some way. This is why gamergate happened over a decade ago - because gamers tend to not become journalists, and these political activist types who love to be journalists tend to hate gaming and gaming culture, which causes a massive drift between ""gaming journalism"" and actual gaming and the people who play them.

American pre-runners (the British) didn't do that and were fine until a certain couple of wars hit their shores and bankrupted them.  Women have their place in their societies, they don't need to be pushed to everything that males almost always done.  It finally gets into cultural things like movies... if a movie didn't push women to be better than or equal to the men, then they are labeled hate speech or maybe even misogynist, and a group will press a lawsuit onto the studio, and social media (at the behest of the government) will ban the studio.

She was badass, but she was also flawed and had realistic conflict which was not simply based on her gender. Plus her banter with Cap was some of the best. 

Then of course there's the way they've shafted my boy Bucky (my favourite MCU character).

"REGARDING ""GIRL BOSS""/ FEMINISM- FEMALE EMPOWERMENT WOKENESS

Generally, i do NOT have any issue whether a character is ""BOSS"" or not irrespective of gender, race, sexuality, etc .... my PRIORITY is the story, good writing and implementation which includes without contradicting pre-established canon and lore for existing franchises.

For the example.... 

I find it quite odd that folks attack Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies for being  for pro-feminism wokeness yet the EXACT SAME FOLKS love and embrace ATOMIC BLONDE movie which is actually MORE WOKE pro-feminist above both Captain Marvel and The Marvels movies COMBINED.

Atomic Blonde is actually a better movie and many will agree on this yet it is MORE WOKE with *FEMALE EMPOWERMENT*.... Ask yourself why?!?

*Simple.... Because Atomic Blonde is a BETTER WRITTEN MOVIE even with its WOKE female empowerment-ism.*

EVERY MEDIA WE HAVE WATCHED THAT SHOWS A WOMAN DEFEATING A MAN IN ANYTHING IS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT and we have enjoyed many of them such as the KILL BILL movies. 

Some good and some bad.... Applies to ALL MEDIA doesn't matter if its woke or not. 

Atomic Blonde is NOT a perfect movie but still far better and more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels despite being more woke.

Breakdown....

(1) ....Atomic Blonde being able to tank direct hits from well trained MALE agents better than them without superpowers, no assistance or extra abilities makes her more woke than Captn Marvel +  The Marvels whose extra super powers makes her and them  (Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel, Photon) almost invulnerable which provides extra-boost protection from damage.

Atomic Blonde makes the case for women being able to fight trained male fighters in direct combat like in UFC, Muay Thai and Boxing or whatever combat sports which is what the  extremist feminists are pushing IRL.

*Compared to Captn Marvel + The Marvels movies*.....

....that makes the case that women can NOT match men in direct combat without physical augmentation/ extra powers to make the women more powerful.*  Remember the scene at the end of Captain Marvel where the male villain said...

 ...[paraphrasing]... Lets fight without the powers, switch them off and challenge me.... [Captn Marvel refused and instead BLASTED HIM with an energy beam].

The ""message"" here is brutally crystal clear.

 Atomic Blonde heavily implies that if women pushed hard enough (like extremist feminists are doing) under their own natural  strength and endurance without support or assistance  or NO augmentation or extra-powers of any kind... a woman can ass whoop multiple men SINGLEHANDEDLY in direct combat.

 This has been the case for the vast greater abundant  majority (not all) of female lead action movies which involves martial arts and combat.

*And yet Atomic Blonde is much more enjoyable and BETTER movie than both Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies (+ Madam Web) COMBINED despite Atomic Blonde being more woke* .....

This is because of the BETTER WRITING and proper execution of Atomic Blonde made it a better enjoyable movie. 

(2) ....MALE VILLAINS.

Have u also noticed....greater majority (Not all) of such female action movies and/or tv shows have MALE VILLAINS as the final big boss bad guy like in the Black Widow, Atomic Blonde and even the beloved KILL BILL movies amongst very VERY many others. 

This was *NOT* in the Captn Marvel movies (Captn Marvel + The Marvels) as i pointed out earlier whereby both had female villains as the final big boss bad guy in both films.

I know that the final big boss called ""Supreme Intelligence"" in Captain Marvel movie was an alien AI but note that it presented itself as a female form/ a woman throughout the Captain Marvel movie.

(3) .....The WOKE LESBIANISM/ GAY

Notice this in Atomic Blonde movie is literally with a full-on in your face lesbian gay sex scene.

Where was the anti-woke outrage for this?

 Notice how there is no heterosexuality in the Atomic blonde and the lesbo/gay love making is literally shoved straight into the faces of the audience.  It wasn't even subtle or hinted at or innuendo but rather full blast. 

Compared to Captain Marvel movies also did not have any heterosexuality/ male-female love story but it did NOT have any sexuality in it of any kind. Instead it focused on friendship and familial bonds between best friends. 

I have seen some folks online have said Captain Marvel movie had lesbo innuendo between Captn Marvel and her best friend but that's subjective opinion which many disagree with.



TO CONCLUDE ....

Captain Marvel + The Marvels movies had several problems steming from BAD WRITING but wokeness is not part of it. 

Atomic Blonde is a better written movie which is why its more enjoyable than Captain Marvel + The Marvels.

I apply the same logic to the dumpster fire trash of SHE-HULK tv series and crap-fest SECRET INVASION . 

I enjoyed MOON KNIGHT, WANDAVISION and liked FATW (though i think it NEEDED more eps to be more satisfying but it was still good).

At the end of the day if wokeness is the sole blame for ""BAD WRITING"" then by that exact same logic means that non-woke content are ALL automatically 
awe inspiring and captivatingly superb....which is NOT true.

THERE ARE BADLY WRITTEN AND GOOD WELL WRITTEN WOKE AND NON-WOKE CONTENT IN EQUAL MEASURE.

Anyhow, don't watch what u don't like.....i also tend to do this

"I'm probably the exemption, I grew up watching action/super hero/fantasy/science fiction movies with my dad.  There's something weird about an all female lead  tv show/movie that just doesn't appeal to me.  Trust me, I've given it a chance numerous times.  It just doesn't feel natural, feels more forced, like it's literally being shoved down my throat.  In fact, I waited 5 years, to cleanse my palate before finally watching ""captain marvel"" & see for myself what the fuss was all about.  OMG that movie is so bad, I had to stop less than halfway through, forced myself to restart & watch again.  By the 5th try, it was mostly to challenge myself actually finish a bad movie.  Same with ""barbie"", it's way too girlie + felt childish for me & I didn't like it.  Give me fight scenes, explosions, fast cars, crazy flying techniques and I'm all in!!!  To date, the only girl boss type characters/scenes that I like rewatching to this day is from #TheMandalorian season 2 finale ~ where audiences see Cara Dune, Fennec Shand, BoKatan Kryze & Koska Reeves being badasses.  The best part, those characters felt so natural & they didn't take away from the lead: Din Djarin.  Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni did a good job incorporating girl power in a male lead tv series.  We see female characters winning BUT we also got an awesome fight scene between Din vs Moff Gideon.  So there's balance & Din wasn't made to look like an incapable fool who left all the hard work to his female counterparts ~~ Favreau & Filoni knew that would be pandering & they'd lose a big chunk of their action hero loving audience.  Sure a big chunk of that is male but I'm proud to be part of that audience and, so far, nothings changed my preferences in genre.  The forceful push for female leads did the opposite = totally turned me off & no amount of million dollar marketing campaigns will change my mind.",[],2024-04-17T15:45:24Z,@walkerlamebrain

"2 things WOMEN want to see, a bad *** male who is strong and handsome and HOT.. and a woman who is not some super-powered omnipotent girl boss who can do it all!

1) Women who look at girl bosses are the type they never can be, they sabotage the woman who is more successful than them! They can literally run a fortune 500 company, own a 17-billion dollar real estate property, a nice home with acres of land and a multiple story car garage, nicest clothes and her son is a A- student.. what do OTHER women focus on? ""Oh-Em-Gee!! Can you believe her son is not a straight A+ student. She prances around here like she is perfect, judging us like she is better than us! I think her husband must be having an affair. That is probably why has her kid have problems. Or she is having the affair! She is such a ***** I bet she is doing that gardener that carries the leaf blower! A totally nasty hoe and I am not talking about the gardener's tools!! *hahaha* She can't put out the fires in her own house, such a disgraceful woman!!""

2) Women want to look and fantasize about the perfect man who is all ""I will be there for you baby but I will be here if you need me. I will not fight your battles but I will not let you lose! I will always protect you even when I am the one who hurting you. I will step back out of your life even if it hurts me because i love you even if you hate me!"" That is the type of Men that women go see in movies because they seem like a fantasy they will search the world over looking for the one ounce of the perfect man and settle for the man who MOSTLY fits that criteria..

Going back there has been PLENTY of women who loved comics, plenty of women who watch superhero movies but the thing is you have to focus on the great aspects of the character. Women who find that type of Thor masculinity HOT, the idea of a Iron-Man who can sweep a girl off her feet with everything she ever wanted to experience and leave her breathless, or the angsty Spider-Man who is aloof but deeply loves someone who is constantly ignored.. women see those types are find something SEXY about them, that is why they GOT POPULAR.. Boys wanted to be the Barbarian because girls responded to the Jocks in school, Boys wanted to be Spider-Man because he was nerdy, doing things they wished they could do if they had the chance, Girls who would flirt with the nerdy boys who believed they was undeserving of the goddesses attention, feeling like Icarus.. if they fly to close to the sun they will burn up.. 


Women I know loved the story ""The Night Gwen Stacy Died"" it was George Stacy dying and he promised him to protect Gwen even from Spider-Man, he knew she loved him too much to ever give up. It was up to Peter to call it off. Gwen was confused as why he became distant. They worked it out but eventually she died, Peter never truly moved on even when he married Mary Jane who he believed he was out of her league. Her legacy was so deep it impacted his life more than Mary Jane ever could. He took all that love for Gwen and used it on her.

"I don't know how you younger guys feel, but do you really want to see ANY women in the cockpit for a Maverick movie?  Realistically, I don't see women ever being able to perform at the same level as men behind the controls.  Yes, they exist but, of course, how many are there to fill quotas?  Like all of them?  When the Israeli military experimented with women in battle, all they would say about it was that it had ""mixed results.""  When the US military tried pitting all male combat teams against all female teams and then mixed gender team, guess what order they ended up in?  All male first by a long shot, followed by mixed teams, followed by all female teams--again by a long shot.  And this study measured all kinds of combat effectiveness from PT through war gaming.

If a girl wants to go see a Maverick movie (probably because her boyfriend dragged her there) and if you want to cater to the few women who end up in the seats, then make girl roles in girl subjects of interest.  Forever it was men doing the action and women who love them, which was reciprocated.  It was always the point in the movie that men would go for popcorn, but it worked.  Each got a part of the movie made for them.  And if there was more guy stuff in a movie it was because that was the target audience.  I mean do you youngsters (meaning anyone younger than me, and I'm 61) really want women in the cockpit even as minor characters, or are you just trying to be ""fair"" when the situation doesn't call for it?  I mean we're talking about MEN'S MOVIES here.""  Don't we at least get that much?  In other words, a realistic view of the world.

"""Hollywood can still make movies with kick-ass female heroes...""

No, they can't.  Hollywood can attempt to ""re-focus"" on stories and characters that men like all they want but if the girlboss door is left even slightly ajar, the temptation to return to that well will be too strong to resist.  I can easily see a scenario where there's a tiny blip of stories with competent, cool male leads that are still paired with the same overpowered, hyper-competent female architype, but slightly less so.  And they'll win some decent returns because men are so starved for _any_ strong male hero with a pulse.  But as soon as the money starts flowing again, studios will learn exactly the wrong lesson.  They'll think that they've finally solved the woman-led story problem and revert back to the same excruciatingly awful girlboss trope, just with a slightly less pathetic male sidekick.

My best friend is obsessed with Star Wars.  She didn’t even fall for the Member Berries in Force Awakens because she was so livid that they’d scrapped every “strong female character” in the extended universe (she read allllll the books) in order to effectively gender swap Luke but give him no character development.

Didn’t see Madame Web because it looked like crap, the effects were crap, and they recruited some plank of wood from the Twilight fanfic movies to be a born awesome girl boss.

And inevitably when we get the whole “don’t worry ladies you never have to work at anything you’re born great grrrl power” message, we don’t even get fun villains, just paper tigers for the girl boss with all the midichlorians or chi or whatever to neatly dispatch without effort.

"Females are *hypergamous*. Meaning, they aspire to men who are above their station and will leave a lower-status male for a higher-status male. How does this pertain to the failure of the girl-boss genre? The vast majority of women (ie outside Hollywood writing rooms) do not fantasize about dominating men. They fantasize about men who are wealthier, handsomer, more respected, and more capable than they are themselves. This is because of genetic/evolutionary signaling that this male would make the best possible father for my offspring. What they get in the girlboss genre is weak men who fail and lose status. This simply does not correlate with the majority of female fantasy/ideal, and therefore is doomed to fail. The analog would be an action hero flick where the girl rescued by the hero is fat, dumpy, whiny, and slow. It would fail to capture the male rescue fantasy and would be a loser at the box office.

Hollywood can still make a girlboss flick, but they will need to make the male character competent and strong, and probably somewhat aloof and alluring. The girlboss doesn't have to fall for the male - she can still be powerful in herself - but they need to acknowledge that the girlboss is at least a tiny bit aware of his presence and holds a sliver of respect for him and doesn't simply debase him outright. That alone would boost the numbers of men AND women who'd go to see the film.",[],2024-03-22T13:18:40Z,@nadavegan

Carter from Stargate, Doctor Weir from Atlantis,  Sarah Connor.. I mean the list goes on endlessly if you life isn't a perpetual Twitter/X feed. Same goes for Black actors, or whatever race you want to toss in the bucket.

No one actually cared, or even gave it a second thought, because the stories were incredible and the actors took your mind to another world where these things don't exist.

It seemed Poe's sole purpose was to have inadequacies in any given situation that were easily revoked by any given female character: Leia in leadership; Rey in self-reliance, Tico in dedication; and whoever that Laura Dern character was that just popped-up long enough to make the ultimate self-sacrifice-play.

"Girlboss concepts shouldn't be dead. I don't want them to be dead. I just need them to be written like their male counterparts.  None of us would have enjoyed Ironman if Tony Stark spent 90% of the movie in his suit and was 100% invulnerable to any danger coming his way.  Instead, he was portrayed as an arrogant man with a god complex, and although likable and funny, his traits needed to undergo scrutiny and adjustment throughout many movies...from IM1 to Avengers Endgame. I even liked Wonderwoman.  She had flaws.  She had to learn how to use her powers responsibly.  They kind of derailed her character in the follow-up movie though (leaning into the strong Wahmen trope), and ended up being worse off for it. What pisses me off is that everything strong female characters can overcome as part of their journeys is right there already...primed to be explored.  IF Spiderman could struggle with his anonymity and letting go of his love interest in favor of keeping her safe while he does what he needs to do as a hero, why can't similarly powerful female characters not have the same exploration journey? Why has having feelings for someone from the opposite sex become such a big no-no for strong female characters? Why did having to juggle a personal life and their hero duties become something completely absent from their story arcs? Why have the mcguffin they require to spring into action become so impersonal, mundane and handed to one-dimensional villains with 3 IMDB movie credits. They have the recipe.  They simply need to look at any comic book movie made from 2000 to 2016 to find all the ingredients they need to make a strong female superhero character work. I'm not saying every single MArvel movie ever made before 2016 was equal in quality, but they all (at least) had heart. With a good story, real struggles, and a director that knows what they are doing there is no reason strong female led comic book movies cant work.  But as long as they persist with ding what they are doing right now, they are literally going to continue to flush money down the drain.  I love that Dakota Johnson even criticized the movie.

When they make these girlboss films, their audience is fucking nobody from the existing fanbase, because those women who already enjoyed marvel films don't want to watch films that actively shit on men at every opportunity.

"What is wrong with modern feminism? Just about everything. We see come to fruition the argument and dire warning that CS Lewis laid out over 50 years ago. If you abandon objective reason all that is left is instinct and appetite led by the emotional state of the day. Morality is relative, not objective  and hedonism and anarchy, from blindly following instinct and emotion, follow in due course. Chaos and inconsistency reigns as instinctual appetites change from week to week, even day to day. Long term planning goes out the window, subjected to short term whim. Truth and justice become arbitrary. The individual becomes listless and paralyzed and many feminists become bitter and hateful, as they can only blame others and not themselves for their misery. 
Modern feminists are dominated by envy for what they don't have which is whatever traits only men seem to have that they covet. And sadly, such women have bad judgement and covet the dominant dark triad traits of poor quality men. They also will promote such men where they find them over high quality men with good traits which they dismiss as weakness. 
In the real world the pattern of feminists is as follows: Men create a profession or other social construct (club, college degree, computer game industry, film genre, democratic system) and run it in a fair and orderly fashion. Women covet what men have built for themselves in society, barge in, commandeer it for themselves, ruin it and then abandon it. Men then leave and create a new social construct. Rinse and repeat.  
What happened to Marvel and Star Wars is just one of so many examples of how feminists behave. The worst part is that feminists seem to be natural proponents of socialist behavior. They want power for power's sake, then they abuse that power to turn whatever organization they took over into a narcissistic version of themselves with only a narrow appeal to a very few like minded individuals. They don't care what anyone else thinks nor do they care what it does to the brand and company.

As a result, arts truly did become a safe space, or a breeding ground for liberals, feminists, Marxists and so on, and people who get those degrees are the ones with such worldviews, usually skewed far to the left of the population average.
And when that happens, and when those people start taking all the major positions in the creative industry- of course they will tell their girlboss stories, because that's their idea of how the world should be.

"Excellent commentary with a lot of truth behind it.  The real question remains though as to whether the studios have the guts to face down the withering reviews of the woke media critics they will receive if/when they return to a formula that's desired.  The progressive machine behind these unpopular plots is still small in comparison to the general population.  Yet when they set their sites on a target they can do a lot of damage to a corporation, especially when they get their buddies in government involved in the process (which they nearly always do).  I honestly feel bad for these studios because they are basically screwed either way.  Make their core audiences happy again and revenues will go up, but the media mob will go nuts and suddenly tax breaks will disappear, odd FTC investigations will open up, etc. etc.  There really needs to be a cultural change back to the norm first if they are ever going to be very profitable again.",[],2024-03-07T07:10:48Z,@lostkrusader4495

Those 2 things are interesting because they are not the norm; even then they lose their appeal after awhile. There is a reason the trope of a hero losing then coming back is so prevalent. Every now and then a Seagal or OPM throws a nice alternative into the mix, but you cant have every single character in every movie/TV show be like that.\n\nAnd every single female character is written that way.

You cant really have a character that shows growth without first showing them being immature, AND actually suffering the consequences of it.

They must already start at the finish line of the race, because showing them struggling to learn how to run is deemed offensive.', 'They tried to pretend that Rey needed to train at the start of her third movie, though.', 'its because male hero movies are more or less based on reality where it counts, making them relatable to men by showing the extreme struggles most men go through to succeed. these political activist writers can\'t acknowledge reality, they need to push their ""women are better than men"" agenda, and so they make things that require a lot of work and effort for men just come freely and easily to women, all the while the male characters will be so unrealistic and  unrelated to men (just bumbling privileged idiots who mess things up despite them being ""easy""), and EVERY struggle the mary sue character will run into is because of these inferior men.']",2024-03-06T08:08:50Z,@sctkarter1111

"The woke agenda failed because they tried to erase/blend the genders, which just doesn't work. The marketing and social media echo chambers might have made these ideas feel empowering, but at the end of the day money talks. You can't make plastic, overbearing female characters who portray the worst qualities of men and male characters who act like simps and babies and make people want to watch them because almost nobody has any interest in erasing gender values. This isn't ""female"" empowerment, it's female erasure. Just like it's male erasure. 

We already have classic action and scifi movies with compelling female leads: Ripley in the Alien franchise, Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise. You didn't need to erase their womanhood to make them cool. You didn't need to show these physically small women taking on huge men in hand-to-hand combat and winning. They were portrayed as kicking ass within their natural capacities and it was epic. Women generally aren't as physically strong as men, but so what. Galadriel in Lord of the Rings? She was perfectly feminine, but do you think anyone in Middle Earth wanted to mess with her? Nope.

Women simply do not have the magnetism to lead an action movie. This is indisputably proven by the stream of flops we've seen, where the studios force this agenda down our throats, to no avail.

They are the ones who havent had equality within their careers and possibly personal lives, its always been the dirty old rapey white men that ran it like a pervy boys club and now the new age folk want to get their chance to prove they are...??....as good?
The problem is, they think everyone has been treated like they have and the truth is we havent, not for generations, I mean some have obviously as theres always a few bastards out there.

But the new hollywoke elite have an hatred for their former masters so strong that they are trying to change society and bend it into their twisted image of what they think society should be, strong 'individuals' that dont need any help from men, especially white ones.
This hatred is so strong that not only are they trying to bend society to their own twisted views via crap movies they are also trying to delete the history of these franchises. 
Sure we know these franchises were paid for by mysoganistic dirty old pedos, but they are beloved by many....the movies not the pedos that is.

So to try destroy them and delete them from history just to furthur your adgendas is a big No No that they zeems to be starting to understand.

They’re not cobbling together a crack team hoping to push a product with some agenda and win everyone over with their top tier filmmaking. 

They don’t give a shit. They check when their licenses are expiring. Roll over. Squeeze out a lowest possible budget for the material. Half heartedly assemble a team of meh writers and meh directors and throw a decent size bag of money at whatever A to B level actor they can coax into taking the career hit to be the face of a piece of shit. 

They don’t care about the reviews. They don’t even really care if you see it. the LICENSE is more valuable than the movie.

"The irony is that people actually believe that Hollywood invests HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of dollars for the sake of YOUR entertainment. (Please take time to ponder that)

I dont know about you but if i didnt break even on a hundred million dollar investment, (dumb as i am) I'd learn quick and NEVER make that mistake again. Because logically, that makes NO sense UNLESS making A profit wasnt your primary goal. 

I know, the quickest gratification, when seeing an expensive movie flop is to point a finger and laugh because it has all the characteristics of a failure. How they missed their target audience. How the audience could have produced a better film. Etc. but hear me out. 

Now, i dont obsess over this because i stand firm in my own beliefs (as should you) so feel free to respond to my comment as you wish. My purpose is to simply offer your mind a different perspective.

With that being said, what i see when i watch HOLLYWOOD films is an attempt at a subtle cultural assimilation. Hollywood is a billion dollar investment to subtly place ideas into your mind through Entertainment. (Think of the movie Inception) but it's real.

The films mentioned in this video all push overt cultural themes and its laughable because we recognize what they are trying to do and rather than conform to their ideas we mock it.  (But continued exposure to Agendas over long periods of time have proven to change massive cultural belief.)

Its easy to recognize an agenda when its overt. But i believe even the most entertaining Hollywood films that we praise also have underlying agendas too and perhaps we've come to embrace their ideology without even knowing it simply because ""that film was so well made.""

If you can hear what im saying, it's ok to watch movies. But watch them with your mentality on guard. Your values on guard. Your morals on guard. Even if the movie is the best movie you've ever seen, you're exposing your mind to someone else's motives.

"Great video I wonder why executives disregard hard core fans of anything anymore??? That’s originally how fan bases became what they are. A company realizes people like their product or project and continue to cater towards the positive reactions. Now that’s seemingly unheard of in modern times. Star wars hasn’t had anything for a core fan for a while and so has marvel. If u really resonated with the movies right after iron man 2 or anything up to the prequels in Star Wars I believe your a core fan and none have been born since those early times. That’s the metric they need to follow is core fans and the consistency that comes from that, then build upon it, not the other way around. No one can force people to casually view media and expect growth. However, you can cause a hardcore fan no choice but to see the new project that’s from a universe they love, that’s easy and already proven to work monetarily.",[],2024-02-28T23:28:38Z,@javionblade21

"4:49 it's not that women don't connect to these superheroes because they represent ""masculine ideals"", it's because girlboss characters have no character arc.

 They're not allowed to have flaws or make mistakes by the script so they start out ""perfect"" and end exactly in the same place. It's a Hero's Journey, except you miss a critical part of the journey. And because it's such a shallow way of pandering to a female audience,  you can easily see through it.

A movie that doesn't fall into this trap is Everything ,everywhere, all at once where Evelyn, the main character and pseudo superhero, is allowed to be flawed and makes embarrassing mistakes. And so  she is actually interesting and enjoyable to watch, despite her also kicking a lot of ass in the last act.

"It ain't about ""female power"" or ""strong female lead characters"" or even ""what race are they?"" - and that's what most people don't understand.

The NEW generations want politically correct, politically charged bullshit and are okay with making drastic changes and deviations from established characters and stories in order to fuel a weird power fantasy.

The CORE nerds who just want to watch a damn movie don't care about that shit, we just don't want our stories that we invested time and money into to turn into garbage because of some politically correct nonsense.

Example: Black Panther 2 had the worst female leads I've seen in a movie since Prey. They offered and contributed nothing to the franchise/story, they looked around with bug eyed wonder, they were impulsive, stupid, narcissistic assholes and we're supposed to connect with that? Fuck that, give me the original Black Panther back. You want strong characters for everyone? Go watch Predator 2, Alien or Aliens, Terminator 1/2 , plenty of strong female leads, extras and co-stars that men and women of all races adored. True Lies had a good female lead, Long Kiss Goodnight had a great female lead, but nope, can't have cool shit anymore.

Now it's all about ""how can we shit on the male audience and make women feel super cool by including weird political statements and racial stereotypes into each character that if you call out as bullshit you'll be labeled sexist or racist for, while attracting an all female audience"" - you can't - you get psychotic ""Mary Sue"" styles who love it because - ""no consequences are great!"" - and the actual female nerds are fucking put off.

"Great job Drinker!  I always love your videos.  Now the issue is - How are we going to get our movies back?  The studios have pushed the pendulum so far with “The Message” that they think they’ll only have to swing back a little bit to get the audience to come back.  Even if they ease up with these over-the-top in-your-face girl bosses (to try to get the male audience back) they’ll still inject the message in subtle annoying ways because they’ll think they can get away with it, as long as they tone down what they’ve been doing.  Tom Green said, about the movie he made, that they put sooooo much over-the-top raunchy disgusting stuff in it, that they knew the censors would cut, for the sole purpose of ensuring the censors would leave the slightly less raunchy disgusting stuff that the makers really wanted in the film.  He knew the censors would have cut the less disgusting vile content if he hadn’t put the MORE disgusting vile stuff.  He pushed way too far so he wouldn’t have to come back as much.

That’s what these studios are doing.  They’ll tone down the message a little, thinking it’ll bring bake the audience, but it’ll still be there.  Just as ridiculous, annoying, and story breaking as ever, just maybe less noticeable.  I say we can’t let them get away with it.  To me Disney is dead.  And they killed Marvel and Star Wars.  And not only them but all of these writers and creators who sacrifice good stories and characters to try to “fix the problem” of men and women being different, or having male fans expect the kind of stories and characters that made them fans in the first place. 

I have not seen anything with Carol Danvers in it (except End Game).  I have not seen The Last Skywalker.  I haven’t seen anything that Amazon makes.

So in the 70s the studio execs decided to swing for the fences.  Major studios as well as small boutique shops all went a different direction trying to solve the problem.  This approach created Tarantino's much loved 70s film making.  I think once studios acknowledge and accept the Panderstone is dead, they'll all start taking chances in a million directions.  Which for us means great movies.",[],2024-02-28T15:57:50Z,@vasiliarkhipov2121

"I think of them as ""chick flix"". 

I love watching those shows because Im a woman. Mostly shows like ""the Good Girls"" and ""The marvels"" was very entertaining with the swaps, cat vomit escape, and the planet of singing people. 

Sometimes I dont like it if it is ""one - dimensional"" stoic women- bad writing that is not relatable like in the first Captian Marvel movie, star wars ""Rey"", or even Alice in the Resident Evil series. 

Then the Dr. Who Jodie Whitaker took a bad hit without Stephen Moffett writing. It could have been great like when Missy became the master... But terrible writing made it hard to get interest in. 

I usually argue about bad writing was bad with the first ghostbusters all female reboot. Trying too hard thinking SNL comedians made it great the first time with men.  Its entertaining but not memorable or epic as the original.

"Just Another tactic in the ""women empowerment"" movement that's leading absolutely nowhere good for anyone.  For the record I'm not saying all movies with a female lead are propaganda and thus trash.  However most of the ones coming out now have unrelatable, bland characters who's entire being is ""I'm woman"" or ""I'm gay"" just to push a narrative.  There's hardly ever any meaningful development that happens for them, and they skip by every challenge easily with fort knox level plot armor from bad writing.

I dunno who I think is worse.  The people writing this schmutt in the first place to push their ideologies.  Or the ignorant people eating it up because it supports the ideology they've been brainwashed by.  Probably worse yet, the people that originally took over well meaning movements, like Feminism, BLM, and LGB, which started as 'please leave us alone / respect us as people' movements and turned into an agree with everything we say, or else movement.  None of them deserve an ounce of respect or support anymore based on current behavior.

The first wonder woman movie was female led and female directed. It wasn't my favorite but it did well in the box office and it wasn't complete garbage. Thor 2, Iron man 2 and 3, Spiderman 2, Captain America 1, Batman vs superman, Suicide squad,  Shang Chi, they were all shit too and they were male led, male directed movies.

"I was raised by a single mom. She suffered from awful rheumatoid arthritis which had her in constant pain, unable to walk sometimes, and left her with severely crippled hands. We survived on pathetic disability checks and lived in a horrible part of town in one of the worst cities in America. She loved reading and wanted to be a writer. When I was a teen she started taking some classes at a local vocational college where courses were less than $100. There she discovered the hard sciences and no longer wanted to be a writer; she wanted to be an engineer. She worked her ass off and ultimately graduated with honors in nuclear engineering at a respected university and promptly started working as an intern at one of the country’s premier energy and defense laboratories. Many years and several additional degrees later she is now the director of research and development. She has ridden in tanks, worked on experimental reactors, oversaw safety for all nuclear operations, and is adored by her staff who she is 100% devoted to. She even recently had a stroke and I shit you not when she was laying on the hospital bed at the ER and couldn’t move her arm or leg her biggest concern was that she was in the process of giving one of her staff a promotion and she wasn’t able to complete the paperwork due to being in the hospital. Within several days she was up and shuffling around with a walker. Before the week was out she was sitting in a chair in her hospital room, refusing to lay in bed, and eager to leave so she could get on with her life and get back to work.

"What Hollywood has forgotten is that no matter how unbelievable you get with stories, the characters have to be believable. 
In Top Gun: Maverick, I found Phoenix to be believable. I've run into women like her before. In aviation, there are parts that women have to be 'rough' because of the nature of who they fly/work with and the job itself. That doesn't mean they have to throw away ever being feminine. I've seen these same women dress to the nines when they are able to. 
I personally don't mind a strong female character. How to Train Your Dragon did a great job of that with Astrid. However, they kept her believable and as such people really came to like her. She got jealous, nervous, sad and made numerous mistakes. It was all a part of great and believable character development.",[],2024-02-27T16:46:19Z,@kidf22

"There seems to be a trend in long-running franchises these days of building out a niche product then expanding it out into the mainstream in an effort to get more people involved (read:make more money) where a company makes a product that does well with its intended (somewhat minority) audience, then adds elements that others enjoy which has a marginal cost of not including things that the original audience liked. They must think that the original audience is hooked already and will accept anything while moving on to an audience that sees more of what it wants to see in this franchise that didn't already appeal to them.

I've been a Magic: the Gathering player for over a decade now and that's definitely a trend that has been happening more and more.","[""Yeah, kinda floored me when a friend told me they made a whole Lord of the Rings tie-in that drastically changes the whole game.

but I want to watch men being men and bad asses…. women to be feminine, even if they are strong, and I realization that at some point they’re strength isn’t good enough, and they need the man to save them — even if they are fairly capable .   They don’t need to be completely useless, but they shouldn’t be the hero of the film. We need the men being the heroes .  It’s fun and sexy.

"Somehow feminism changed from ""women are just as worthy as men"" to ""women are exactly like men"" . This might be a good thing on an individual level, as no one should be assuming they know about anyone interests or talents just based on gender. But on a population level , men and women have different preferences in entertainment. If some book or movie genres lean 75%  male or 75% female, writers should not try to twist the genre until the ratio is 50:50. Maybe there is an opportunity to market better to the 25% , its totally natural for any company trying to maximize profit to wonder if there is an untapped market. But the core of the artistic work should not be changed in pursuit of some arbitrary equal gender ratio. Some of these studios seem to think that if the world had no sexism, the gender breakdown of viewers for romance movies and action movies would be exactly the same, and any deviation from that is proof of sexism.

"Hollywood writers legitimately don't understand how the free market works; you make a product because people buy it, not the other way around.  People don't buy your product because you made it -- you make it because they buy it.  The consumer is in control here, not the producer.  As the producer, you make anything as long as it sells.  That's how you make money.  The problem is bigger than Hollywood because this is just one head of a giant marxist hydra.  Basically, radical marxists took over college universities, and they taught students a fictional story about how society conditions them to behave in a way that is unnatural to them, when the reverse is true:  society at large is controlled by the preferences of the individuals.  Women prefer love stories over action/thriller, and this controls what movies are produced for women.  Inline with the marxist schooling, they thought the reverse was true:  they thought Hollywood decides what women prefer.

"These studios aren't about profits anymore (they're backed up well through big bankers family). These losses are the price they're willingly paying in order to carry on their plane to normalize their agendas. Back in 1889, an American movie introduced the first kissing scene ever in cinema history, the Conservative society back then made an outrage and wasn't happy about this form of intimacious degeneracy. It was thought to be a private thingy between husband and wife... Well, we all now what happened afterwards. As the time goes people swallowed that pill along with the other new ideological pills brought by the likes of Alfred Kinsey and playboy founder to the extent where the western society accepted the idea of having sex outside marriage, or even identifying a woman who lived for no more than a year with her pimp as a legitimate wife equal to a respectful house wife...

The same cycle is repeating itself now. Promoting feminism = spreading more competitive fallacies between men and women = destroying the nuclear family model = less marriage, more open sexual relationships = more lost bast@rd children = lost children.

Lost children means lost future generations, the confusion reaches a point where they can't even whether they're male or female... The average trans person who starts at such a young age spends an average of 300k-3M dollars on body modifications, surgeries, drugs and puberty blockers etc...

So they think that if they change the culture they can change society and make women more like men (more equality).

"I get what you’re trying to say here, but you seem to be assuming what the cause and effects are in this topic. I don’t see any reason to think that men inherently like one thing and women inherently like another. Most of the difference between men and women likes and dislikes are socially driven. Men are the primary audience of superhero movies because traditionally they have male protagonist. There are plenty of sci-fi or fantasy movies that contain good and entertaining female protagonists. The issue with the marvel flops isn’t because they were female leads. It’s because the stories were poorly written and poorly produced movies. In fact I would argue that one of the reasons why some of these movies haven’t been successful is because they wrote the stories as if females were going to be more in to different types of characters. If they had just treated the female lead movies as if there was a male lead and not changed the style of movie I think they would have been more successful. Characters like Captain Marvel and She Hulk are power focused characters. They are meant to overwhelm and overpower their opponents. The focus shouldn’t have been about their weaknesses and relationships. But regardless, Marvels problems are nothing to do with the sex of its leads, it is to do with money hungry attitude and ignoring character development and writing. They are trying to rush through characters with little to no character development and writing stories for maximum revenue instead of focusing on the story.",[],2024-02-26T14:25:30Z,@lotsofstuff9645

"The actual reason for Hollywood's decline into laughable nonsense has mostly to do with the social structure of civilization.   Agriculture-based civilization was founded on the illusion that nature can be controlled by human action.  Nature becomes a machine engineered and operated by specialists.   Generally, civilization opposes the natural cycles and processes of unbridled, evolving nature sometimes to people's benefit and sometimes not.  Truth is .... the more civilized (meaning urbanized) a person or a society becomes, the crazier and more disconnected from reality it gets. The hyper-urbanized, far-Leftists of Hollywood are a great case-in-point.  They are utterly disconnected from reality and thus try to engineer society and nature towards their bizarre political POV, i.e. girls are just like boys and they want the same things in life.  In an earlier generation, Walt Disney did the same thing with his Disneyland.

"I hate to say it because it will come across as an attack on what was a pretty good movie franchise but I feel the pendulum changed due to the Hunger Games.  It wasn't overnight but suddenly Hollywood had a female in an action role that people wanted to watch.  Not just the women but the men too.  And soon after Hollywood forgot any lessons they might have been offered in that series.  Katniss was good, but she was good for a good reason, she trained and had to break the law to be good to survive.  Now they just get to be good.  Period.  No reason or explanation.  Katniss could win, but every victory came at a personal cost.  From the girl dying to having to sacrifice her love for her guy she had to pay a cost.  Now the only people made to suffer are males and the audience.  At the end, after all the sacrifice and all the suffering and pain the whole reason she went through it all, to save her sister was forfeit.  Now the girl boss just struts to the next iteration.
The real problem is the wimps and simps and female empowerment freaks out there are clearly clueless about what a real powerful and respectable PERSON would look like.  They think Thor was seen as powerful because he had a hammer and muscles.  In the comics he was powerful because though a god he had hills to climb, rivers to cross and pains to bare.  I hope they will find a few good men, now thye wimps and simps to do some of the writing.  At least enough to influence.

"I work in marketing and the first thing every creative needs to know is “who is the customer or audience for my product?”. When you are coming in to market an existing product you don’t just suddenly change the customer segment you market to just because you don’t like the old one. You may over time expand your audience, but you never abandon your core customer base! And you certainly don’t insult your core in the process! NEVER! To do so is to risk losing your customers and your whole business.

Then there’s the whole issue with ‘tokenizing’ people to appeal to a new audience segment in a shallow way. As Drinker points out that’s essentially what these writers did with the Female ""Girl Boss"". How are these characters more than a cheap pastiche of what a woman looks like? They aren't. It’s a shallow, one dimensional portrayal of this demographic that is totally unrelatable. That's exactly what South Park was taking the piss out of in the Panderverse!

I can guarantee that this fiasco will be a front and centre case study of what-not-to-do in Marketing 101 clasess across the world for the next 20 years!

If Disney/MCU/Lucas Films want to salvage their brands they should send every staffer back to basic marketing training and fire the executives who were in charge of this madness. Kathleen Kennedy would be a good start and send a clear signal to the rest of the staff, investors and disenfranchised customers that they mean to start fresh.","[""The issue is precisely that their priority (the creatives at least) isn't to draw the biggest audience or make the most money for the movie."", ""Like creatives have any power in the showbiz, they're wagies that obey their bosses, and said bosses can hire anyone, including non woke creatives."", ""\u200b@@Freakymation-z4dagreed that a lot of creatives didn't have control over the overall direction. That's a decision by leadership at the top - the Kathleen Kennedys. They would then go out and contract the creatives to work on a project (usually third party companies, not wagies).  Clearly the core root of the problem lies at the top, which totally abandoned their base audience in pursuing on a non-eixstant one. As I said, those folks should be fired for such disasterous decision making and absolute ignorance of fundamental business practices.\n\nThat said, everyone else below them is going to need re-training to re-orient them in the direction the new leadership needs to take this ship. Everyone has to be pulling in the same direction if Disney/MCU/Lucasfilm is to be saved from ruin.\n\nSo I think the real question is does Bob Iger have the leadership capacity to axe Kennedy or is going down with her?"", ""I'm a VP of Marketing and co-sign this 100%."", 'My genuine question as someone who knows nothing about how these choices are made, how can people who work in your field seriously look at these trailers put them together and feel people will seriously be excited unless it’s just new to them, as a nerd of a lot of different things it feels like the same is being done all around and almost every new movie or show feels almost like a parody.']",2024-02-26T04:49:09Z,@jaywatanabe4706
"I slightly disagree with the conclusion of this video.  There are plenty of women who like superhero films/shows.  Just like there are men who like romance stuff.  I mean, just look at the success of various anime series which have done both.  The underlying factor is how it's implemented.  Tons of men will go watch a romance anime because they like the female characters.  Tons of women went to the early Marvel or James Bond films because it had shirtless hunks fighting for a woman.  What changed is what the video points out.  Hollywood went full contradictory mode and tried to subvert every time-tested archetypes.

Most girls still act like girls, use feminine, act like a victim and their attitude actually doesnt have the same that a superhero has, because its never in a female characteristic to have one... because male gender doesnt fake it, it comes naturally to male( being gentlement, protective, kind ) while women are different, women CAN be kind but most are too emotional ( which the movie lacks for female characters ) most are bitchy ( they got that part in the movie ) and they love ( which for some reason, movies want them to be single and independent ) this is why audience could never relate...... reason why women watch romantic movies and men watch super heroes because it speaks to them

For instance, a lot of conservatives call the Barbie movie woke, yet it made billions of dollars. \n\nMost of these movies fail because they are trying to appeal to two audiences at the same time. Women generally don\'t watch action movies and men don\'t like getting talked down to by girlbosses.', '@@jorami4838 It made billions of dollars because its target audience was women and many younger women and girls.  Young girls more than likely don’t care about politics and about 40% of women aged 18-29 in the U.S. identify as left leaning so I wouldn’t be surprised that a movie considered woke and aimed at that audience was still wildly successful.  However when it comes to superhero movies or sci fi and action the audience is different.  The reason the movies are failing is because companies like Disney are trying to keep a high CEI score which basically means the more “woke” aspects that are used in your companies products like adding “wokeness” to movies the higher their CEI score.  Disney has been pumping out all these movies in the hero genre with these aspects and they keep flopping because the audience these movies target doesn’t want to see that in the movies, they care about the movie and characters being relatable not how diverse they are.  So yeah I’d say adding the woke aspects to these movies are going against their audience hence why it is part of the reason they keep failing.']",2024-02-25T11:56:59Z,@jorami4838

I'll say disappear because I can't use more colorful, truthful language to convey my feelings on the matter while still ensuring the comment stays up. But anyway, the problem isn't 'women.' The problem is 'mid-thirties man-hating women who don't even know why they're there.' Nobody cared that Sarah Connor was the protagonist of T2. In fact, it actually worked out for the best. Same thing for Ripley in Aliens. And, as long as we're mentioning the obligatory, obsequious 'I don't hate women, really' examples (seriously, you people need to learn that they will never stop accusing you of being misogynists, stop trying to convince them you don't hate women, they don't care if you hate women or not, it's just a weapon to use against you), how about Charlie, from the legendary film, The Long Kiss Goodnight, otherwise known as Samantha Caine?

I've got some bad news for those of you who think this is going to mean positive change; imagine the Buzzfeed Try Guys being the new wave of male action stars. That's what will replace this. What? You thought that because they're getting rid of the girlboss (maybe, that remains to be seen) that they're going to go back to making good movies? They _hate_ good movies. They don't believe in human universals like primal fear, love, appreciation of beauty, or death. In fact, they devote their lives to using whatever means at their disposal to convince the public that such things don't exist. You're not getting Ellen Ripley, Sam Caine, or Sarah Connor back, ever. They're gone. They don't make 'em like they used to.

yes, the US film industry has arguably overcorrected in its representation of heroic female protagonists - and it has certainly greenlit some stinkers as a result - but it only takes one movie where your putative 'girlboss' is well written and convincing to illustrate that these qualities need not be restricted to male protagonists.

"Secondary point: 
Have you noticed how most of the marketing of ""female led"" / ""girlboss"" etc. seems to be designed like they are apologizing for having a hero / protagonist that is not male? Having a chip on their shoulder about the issue does not change the fact THEY are the ones making an issue out of it. If they really meant what they said about representation, they wouldn't feel the need to over-emphasize it every time they made a film like that. They could just tell a good story, with good acting, and let those chips fall where they may. 

So if the executives' opening move is to apologize for or try to counteract societal racism or sexism, it is their own biases & sexism they are overcompensating for. 
THEY are the ones who expect a female-led action movie will not make money on its own merits. (Or they do not want to invest in it having merit.) 
THEY are the ones who think men only want to see movies about men, and women only about women. (Proven untrue, yet the myth remains? That's literally prejudice.)
THEY think they need a social-justice marketing strategy to justify their film's existence and make money. (Good stories need no justification.) 
 
The audience (society) just wants to be entertained. Make a good & interesting film, something entertaining and memorable. It does not have to be all things to all people/demographics. If it's good, and you support it with good marketing (not bury it in bad marketing or make it entirely a product of cynical marketing), then people will go see it - theaters, TV, streaming, whatever. Nobody is excluded from watching something, and if they hear there's something that's actually good, the audience will find it on their own.",[],2024-02-24T21:56:49Z,@wyldhowl2821

"I've got no problem with the (hate to use the cliche term) ""girlboss"". If done right, a movie with a female lead can be a hit, can have quality, and it has been proven, can draw an audience. 
Too bad the media megacorporations have no idea what the terms ""quality"" or ""story integrity"" mean. If they actually create one of these hits, try to remember it is some rarity that slipped under the bosses' radar and landed on target, instead of being shot to pieces by executive meddling. (So good movie making is like a drone attack - funny huh?)  

They are too busy pandering, because they think that is what earns them more revenue (even though it's clear now it actually earns them less). 
Are you worried that you are being force-fed ""the message"" because the media elite really believe in it? Don't worry, because they never did. It is (and has always been) a marketing ploy. They actually give zero fucks about feminism, diversity, social justice, or any sort of actual meaningful representation on screen. It is still all about capitalism, milking creative people like cows before sending them to the slaughterhouse. 

These same big money executives will push hard on the ""girl power"" message at the same time as they are Harvey Weinstein-ing their leading ladies somewhere in the back room. And if they have a female accomplice executive, that person is just as soulless and every bit as much their equal when it comes to sucking creative people dry then discarding the dessicated husks of their careers. Those are the real girl-bosses. De-emphasize ""girl"" and emphasize ""boss"" if you want to really understand how and why it works this way. 

The marketing zeitgeist once under-represented some, then over-represented them, and who the fuck knows what comes next, other than the fact it never was and never will be sincere.  The only certainty is that the bosses do what they do because they expect to be paid big dividends by pandering to trends, riding each and every bandwagon until the wheels fall off.",[],2024-02-24T21:22:07Z,@wyldhowl2821

"Female comic book fan here: We don't like being pandered to, dear Hollywood. 
If you want to grow your female fan base, target marketing at the og fans bringing their daughters, sisters, girlfriends, and so on to these films. My dad introduced my mother and I to comics. That's how a lot of the minority female audience got into this genre. Stop effing with the actual product and just shift marketing towards men with daughters, granddaughters, girlfriends, wives, female friends, nieces, and so on. Make comic books the ""it"" thing to do for the men in our lives. Want to get dad something more thoughtful than his 80th necktie? Take him to that new superhero movie you know he's been dying to see! Something like that.
Offer free tickets to women to your films on a certain day or certain showing (bars do that to bring in more women - in turn, bringing in more men, too). Give free comics on opening day with the purchase of a ticket; bringing in more people to the films AND the comics. Why do you think baseball stadiums do giveaways to the first so many fans who buy a ticket to the game? Why do conventions and concerts give swag bags to people who spend a certain amount of money for their tickets? Why does Free Comic Book Day exist? If you want to shift your target demographic without destroying your existing fan base (as this will ensure the business to fail), you have to transition into that new fanbase slowly AND spend a lot of time and money on advertising. Comic book industry, you aren't social media; following trends will lose you money rather than gain it. Leave the trends to us on social media and you go back to creating art. Trends work here because the content is free. Hollywood content is a massive financial commitment to get behind. No one who has their own money (ie: older teens and adults - I don't think you're looking to get 6th graders to your pg13 and r rated films) aren't going to spend it just to follow a trend. Nor will they spend it on a trend that requires a time commitment. A three hour+ long film is not going to be appealing if the entire selling point is ""Yeah! Girl power!""

"Say what you will about Amazon, but once they get the numbers, the FOLLOW those numbers. Yeah, Rings of Power went off a cliff, but they got the information off of that failure, and now they're correcting course, which you can see by their rework of Silk. It isn't even necessarily about the man/woman audience. Another whole thing lost in the sauce of all this is how every character gets changed characters. Madame Web did this, as the original character was pretty old, well into her 60s to early 70s. Parapalegic, blind and deaf to a disease that has had her living the vast majority of her life attached to a life support rig shaped like a spider's web. She's enigmatic, with remarkably little known about her history and background, despite forty years of comics. Her powers are in-born, she's a mutant, having pre-cognition, telepathy, astral projection, and can perform psychic surgery on a target's mind. Despite ALL of this, she is a hero, in a situation where no one would blame her if she just lived a quiet life away from all of it. Instead, despite the dangers, she works to help the world.

Movie Web is your standard girlboss run, which demeans the original character, and they got way too into linking her and everyone to Spider-Man right out of the box, in a way that drags down Spidey and company. One of the main reasons that Madame Web reveals herself TO Spider-Man is a trait that is unique to how Peter operates: Despite a chain of losses, Peter is still fundamentally optimistic and holds himself to a level of responsibility that no other superhero in Marvel comes close to, despite everything in his life being much easier if he didn't.

Yes it is great to see a strong female character as the lead. The problem is, Hollywood doesn't know what a strong female is. They think an over powered, fighting the patriarchy, perfect as she is, no character development, no flaws, surrounded by dumbed down males is the epitome of a strong female.

Calculate into the equation that the most ""iconic"" (socially impactful?) franchises were swallowed up by the large studios, especially Disney, then you come to an almost inescapable conclusion that these franchises were purposely ""de-masculinized"" simultaneously.  Also disturbing is the rhetoric coming from the large hedge funds that control the Boards of the studios, regarding DEI and other social engineering objectives.  In short... when you put it all together there is a glaring possibility that these iconic franchises (and new franchises/characters) have been subject to a planned demolition with a structured ""re-imagining""  with the objective of multi-vector social change (engineering?)... all backed by the studios, who are controlled by their Boards, who are in turn controlled by the giant hedge funds.

Men are interested in creating things and saving people.

Women are interested in building interpersonal relationships and nurturing people. 

That doesn't mean men only think of the first two while women think of the latter two. But it does mean that if you use saving the world as the catalyst of a film, it's men who will be drawn in as that is their power fantasy.

What's women's? Beauty and the Beast. It offers the adventure, magic, mystery and discovery of the above type of film, but the core is about a complex relationship between two people exploring whether / why they should get together.

"I like to look to Captain Janeway from Star Trek Voyager on how to do a female lead properly in male targeted properties. 

Firstly. They didn't beat you over the head about her being a woman. Sure they acknowledge it, but they don't go out of their way to remind you every chance they get. Secondly. She needs the men of her crew and uses them equally or even better than the women of her crew. She is easily hardest on Seven and B'Elanna. While her number 1 confidant is a male vulcan, her first officer is a man, the first person she recruits in the show is a toxic male inmate who has been cast aside by everyone. Thirdly. She doesn't try to be Jim Kirk or Jean Luc Picard. Does she carry some of their traits? Yes. She is a captain and she acts like it. But while both of those men use Masculine energy to lead their respective crews, Janeway ultimately falls into leading with feminine energy and basically becomes the ship's mother... In a good way. I've always said that between those 3 captains, the one I'd feel most comfortable going to with a personal or professional problem would be Janeway... And that's how I should feel. Women should be easier to approach with things like that. Finally, she is likable!! She is a badass and she is inspiring. Is her character written perfectly? Nah. Not really. But Kate Mulgrew did her damndest to make sure the character always had charm, even when the writing was on the weaker side at times. You can't say the same thing about the vast majority of these girl boss characters.",[],2024-02-23T23:51:02Z,@jayvardy

The audience doesn't need to be told ""wow look at this strong woman"" to see a strong female character. In fact it has the opposite effect, people are told to think something, they will hate it by simply because they were told they should like it.

Look at Alien. It released in 1979, has a strong female lead, and yet everyone watching it saw a great classic sci-fi. Women were empowered by the actresses performance, and the male audience didn't even notice or care it _wasn't a man_ because the story doesn't force the fact that she's a woman and strong onto the audience.

"Alright, folks, let's talk about a figure who's been stirring up controversy in the online community: the one and only Critical Drinker. Now, if you're not familiar with him, consider yourself lucky. But for those who have had the misfortune of stumbling upon his channel, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the rabbit hole of toxic masculinity and regressive attitudes.""

First off, let's address the elephant in the room: the Critical Drinker's penchant for belittling and demeaning anyone who doesn't fit into his narrow definition of 'manliness.' From his condescending rants about 'girl power' to his dismissive attitude towards female characters in film, it's clear that he's stuck in a bygone era where misogyny was the norm and empathy was in short supply.""

But here's the real kicker, folks: despite his claims of being a 'rational' critic, the Critical Drinker's views are anything but. They're steeped in outdated stereotypes and fueled by a toxic cocktail of insecurity and resentment. And let's not even get started on his taste in whiskey.""

So, to all you disciples of the Critical Drinker, I have just one thing to say: it's time to wake up from that hangover and smell the coffee. The world is changing, and clinging to outdated notions of masculinity isn't just uncool, it's downright insulting to your own self respect. It's time to embrace diversity, empathy, and respect for all individuals, regardless of gender.""

So here's to progress, here's to equality, and here's to all the voices out there who refuse to be silenced by the likes of the Critical Drinker. Keep speaking out, keep challenging the status quo, and together, we can build a future where everyone feels valued and respected. Cheers to that.",[],2024-02-23T22:15:33Z,@tombillington8564

But they are probably 90% or more smoke shows. Unrealistic, yes. But so is Thor.  Hemsworth is perfect. Scarlett was a perfect black widow. But from there it all went downhill fast. The crusty people on Twitter, Disney acquiesced,  and the heroes of marvel became Much more average pretty fast. Then there is the personality or lack thereof, and interactions...  Thor and captain marvel for example could have had a bit of a rivalry to determine who was stronger rather than turning Thor into the dude and having her tank thanos entire armada. Canon had Thor being true to his moniker and rivaling even galactus in strength, while being not the sharpest tool in the shed. Marvel was *almost* as strong, but a good step behind him. However, she was a better tactician and planner as well as being more fast most of the time. She was also likeable and sometimes funny. Not a condescending cxnt.

"There's an old movie that I think did get the balance between romance for women and action for men to work:

""Hanover Street"".
(SPOILER ALERT)
WWII bomber pilot Harrison Ford falls in love with the breathtakingly beautiful Lesley-Anne Down in London.
Problem is Christopher Plummer, her spy-training husband.
So she has an affair with Ford who's exciting and dashing and etc compared to her ""pleasant"" husband.
Unfortunately, Ford falls in love with her (who the hell wouldn't??) which makes him timid and paranoid about getting blowed out of the sky.
Also unfortunately, the Nazis keep catching Britain's spies. And the latest that Plummer is training just isn't getting it.
So he decides to go himself.
To ensure security, a night drop over Germany from a B-17... guess whose B-17...
So as they're flying over Germany, the Germans decide ""nah, can't have that"" and blow them out of the sky.
The only two survivors, wouldn't you know, are the two men in love with Lesley-Anne Down (least believable part of the movie; every man she meets has to fall in love with her...)
So she's back home waiting word with her daughter, and she finds out who the bomber pilot is, and is both distressed and comforted; thinking she was being punished for her adultery, and thinking that Harrison will get her husband through it alive.

So, Plummer owies his ankle and needs help completing his mission. They pick up a uniform for Ford from a French underground girl whose brother is a Vichy pig, courtesy of the German she killed while they were hiding in her barn.

And they go to Nazi HQ (of course) but the safe they're supposed to get the list of British spies from (and plant a fake list in) is changed. Plummer doesn't know how to open it. As they're driving to the HQ, Plummer explains that he took this mission because he's always been ""pleasant"". And he's worried he's losing his wife because of it, so he wanted to do something dramatic.
He tells Ford that Ford is a natural hero; he's the guy who saves the boy who falls through the ice; Plummer's the guy who gives him his coat to wrap around the boy. Afterwards, Ford would be hailed a hero, and get the girl... and Plummer would have a wet coat.

They go back to Nazi HQ that night and everything goes wrong, but they get away after making the swap...

There's an interlude where the two are in the French barn, and they get to talking... and Ford finds out that it's this guy's wife he's schtuping (that's Yiddish for boinking, I believe). 
So the French girl's rat-bastard brother has finked on them, and here come the Nazis. But, the French girl says there's a resistance cell a few miles away across a bridge, and they will help them.
They escape, chased by the aforementioned Nazis, and as they're crossing the bridge... Plummer is hit... and then the mortars the Resistance are using break the bridge, and Plummer is about to fall to his deadness. Ford tries to save him, Plummer tells him to go on, and asks him to tell his wife he tried to be brave, and Ford gets pissed and saves him anyway. 
They get to the other side with the Resistance providing cover, and Plummer says, rather sadly, ""Looks like I get the wet coat again""
To which Ford replies, ""No. This time you get the girl"".
Cut to: Lesley finds out that they're rescued and rushes to the hospital. She runs into Ford coming out of Plummer's room, and there's a teary scene where Ford tells her that Plummer's a good man, and he's got to go on and she's got to go to Plummer. And it shows Ford crossing the street alone.. The End.
(SPOILER OVER)

I like the ending, but I loved the whole alpha male / beta male dichotomy. And they didn't run it into the ground; sure Ford was the hero most of the time, but Plummer was the man in charge at Nazi headquarters; he was the one who was in his element.

But the thing about the movie that makes me sad is that it's the kind of movie you can watch with your girl (and you'll probably get laid afterwards). It has the romance she wants, the action you want, and a story that weaves the two together in a way that makes sense.
(It makes me sad because, while I have a wet coat, I have no girl...)

On another note, as a woman I'm not sure if ""all-female"" superhero movie is even something other fangirl are all that interested in.

"All of these superhero movies were a potential cash-cow for the film makers. They had a ready-built comic book fan audience that was practically chomping at the bit to see these movies. Then the political idiots in management decided to push the Feminist -""Woke"" Agenda with overpowering injections of ""cultural diversity"" (race-swapping characters, gender-swapping characters, inserting LGBTQ themes not necessary to the story, and pushing the ""anti-Patriarchal ((AKA ""Anti-Male"")) Agenda"") and now the movies that could have been superheroic masterpieces have become steaming piles of cinematic shite.

 As a comic book fan, I was SO DISAPPOINTED in the vast majority of the movies after Avengers Endgame that I have given up even trying to watch them. I long for the days of watching good movies like Captain America: Winter Soldier, or even the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies. The worst of those movies is still better than pure garbage like The Eternals, Black Panther 2, and several other piles of crap produced by the MCU. Even the Nicholas Cage ""Ghost Rider"" movies are masterpieces compared to the recent MCU movies.

The only place where I differ from the Critical Drinker is his dislike of She-Hulk. Yeah, the humor was very dry, and sometimes it was condescending towards men. The writers appeared to know very little about superhero legal stuff. If the writers had simply read the comic series by Dan Slott and Peter David, there would have been a ton of funny material to draw from. But it appears they did not do so. But the main star (Tatiana Maslany) carried a lot of weight, played her part well, and there were some funny moments. So, although it was not the disaster some people think, it could have been so much funnier if the writers had done their research. But I think they might have gotten over-confident and lazy.

These Girlboss movies are simply bad movies. As a feminist, I think they are shit because Hollywood isn't actually liberal or progressive. They are just trying to appear so to get money from an audience they deem to be too stupid to tell the difference. There is no soul or actual understanding of anything behind these movies. That's why they are so hollow and bad. A Barbie movie with spectacular action scenes would be epic if it's made to the same standard as Barbie was. A movie about a female pilot struggling with her career while maintaining a family could absolutely be an amazing movie if it's well made. It wouldn't be a Top gun movie, obviously, but would be its own thing. It's bizarre that anyone thinks Hollywood is feminist. They simply switched from one type of caricature of women to the next.

BRAVER: A Tale of the Afterlife is coming out this month, to Amazon and Kobo, possibly more book platforms later.

Here's the synopsis:
Ben Freeman, a videogame concept designer, is placed in charge of the Craig Manor, a 19th century house with a dark past, where he is expected to develop the latest survival horror title for his company. Grieving his late mother and socially despondent, ready to give up on our World... Until a fated confrontation with the World of the Dead. Between the forces of Darkness and the healing of the Light, he finds in others what he had lost: Love and Hope.

On a Journey that spans the globe, meeting several timelines of human History, his newfound Family braves through countless horrors, which threaten both dimensions, armed with the power of imagination and reasoning, to create a place where the Dead may 'live' in peace. However, to navigate this strange and terrifying place, one must not lose their memories. For without those, Souls become broken and join the endless masses of shadows at the mercy of Despair, which had so far, ruled unchallenged.

This is the Story of the Heroes who changed the Afterlife, forever.
----

Go get it. Hope you enjoy it this year, more to come in the coming years, for a full trilogy of spectral combat, lots of comedy, tears and good feelings, with strong admirable protagonists who regard Family as the highest value of the human condition. I'm building a full mythological take on the Afterlife where the Mother is the spiritual core of our species and it is those qualities in a woman that make her powerful, admirable and lovable. And I think it's about time we start having that conversation about motherhood, even if fantasy is the way to get the foot through the door. Support my work and I'll help steer this stuff in the right direction.

"Saddest part is... this is so much of an missed Opportunity. 
having a precognitive blind Spider Woman is dope AF! think of the norns or moirai. But for a story that jumps in time to work you really have to put the brain cells in . You have think hard and sharp. But if you do. Results can be mind blowing expecially if you order the scenes backwards or not linear , or repeat them to show the different outcome of different decisions (Memento , butterfly effect, ) ... 


Just sad to waste such an opportunity.  

You could go all out with mythology ... having one girl being an Historian / Archelogist (seeing the past) one being some kind of hacker / influencer / trend chasing Profession (seeing the present) and lastly one who can predict the future (both with computer models and of course mystical powers or something) ...

"Since Final Fantasy 7 is getting it's second installment in the ""Re"" series (Which seems not to be Remakes), Tifa's breasts is once again the topic of discussion.
Let's ignore her breasts for once though. Because Tifa and Aerith are probably two of the best versions of female representation in entertainment. 
You have Tifa who on the surface is there as eye candy - as proven by all the discussion of her breasts - and yet she's such an endearing and caring character, very feminine and soft personality. But, she's also a kick ass and capable woman who runs a bar in the slums. A DIVERSE character because she has more than one dimension to her.
Then there's Aerith. Who on the surface looks like a damsel in distress. She looks vulnerable, and more geeky. Not really the ""eye candy"" (Although still very pretty). And yet, Aerith is a strong willed person - what I would call a ""strong female"" in that she doesn't act like a damsel in distress. She leaps into action, and tries to fix problems caused by her. She might not be physically strong, but that doesn't mean she isn't powerful in a feminine way.
The point is that the two women's personalities are the opposite of what their visuals would suggest, which makes them interesting. (Swap their bodies around and I think people would find both characters a lot less appealing).

So yeah, you can have strong women that are also feminine. People don't ""hate strong female characters"" they just hate characters that are just ""strong"" with nothing more going for them, and who happens to be a woman too.

But nowadays, main characters are just a stand in for a message they are trying to send and the other character either fall into ""also a message"" or cannon fodder to show case the message.
Then there's the aweful writing.

"A movie can be unisex if it is truly good enough. The issue is that those movies dont come around every summer. Instead they are usually once in a generation type movies. Like trading places, forest gump, the original star wars, and super bad. There are more but the point is movies good enough to cross sexes also tend to cross cultural boundaries too. Its hard to due. Funny thing is those movies never set out to do that either. They need to stop trying to manipulate one group or another and just make a good movie. You'd be surprise at who shows up when its something worth watching. Look at moonlight. No one expected that but because people appreciated the story.

"1) I thought Batgirl was supposed to be where the pendulum started to swing back.

2) As Drinker quoted Newton at the beginning, I'll paraphrase his first law.  ""An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion.""  To liken this to the Superhero genre, they used to have objects in motion.  People would show up to an MCU movie solely BECAUSE it was an MCU movie.  Star Wars and Star Trek also had a similarly unstoppable motion.

Now?

Even if the pendulum swings back, it'll be an almost Sisyphean task to get that momentum back.  The momentum is gone and the enthusiasm is the proverbial boulder at the bottom of the hill.  Sure, I'll watch Venom 3 (even if Michelle Williams isn't in it).   The third Spiderverse movie is a definite must see.

But Kraven? Maybe?  
Deadpool 3?  I'll wait for reviews to see if Kevin Feige is smart enough to get out of Ryan Reynolds way.
Anything else MCU/Sony Marvel-related.  Meh.  Probably not.
The Gunnverse?  With this, the Boulder is made up of the materials that you find at the core of stars.  

Probably Joker Foile a Deux or The Batman 2 but those aren't part of the Gunnverse.  

While I didn't watch The Flash, I would have given a Sasha Calle Supergirl movie a fair shake.  But that's still not the Gunnverse.

The Gunnverse has the biggest hurdles to gaining any traction and, with the only thing that they have to recommend them is John Cena's Peacemaker, the future looks grim.

Star Wars:  They have Andor Season 2.  I admit that, out of all the other projects, the Rey Star Wars movie is probably the closest thing to me having any form of curiousity.

Star Trek: Lower Decks.  That's it.

"Fantastic vid, i agree with ever point but i think the one thing that trumps each genders preference is good quality film. Each gender most certainly has their preferences for what they like to see on screen but time and time again we can all come together and enjoy cinema if it is of high quality. I believe word of mouth is a highly powerful thing and alot of the time when I've been convinced to go see something i wouldn't otherwise see,;its because enough my peers have praised it highly. As you said, most women are already not enticed by the superhero genre and they definitely wont be if they've heard  that their all female cast superhero film is garbage. Take a look at everything everywhere all at once: absurdist physical comedy, heavy fight scenes and action, sci-fi premise but was still a smash hit across all audiences. I dont think anyone came to the cinema to see it because there was a female lead but because they had heard it was amazing. I think the real reason why the female oriented superhero films were such a failure was because they were just crap. And as the drinker said, it was already in a genre yhat doesn't appeal to women so they were already at a disadvantage challenging the status quo. It would be very interesting to see if women were now more interested in superhero movies had all these female led sci fi, fantasy and superhero media been of high quality. I would like to believe that there would have actually been a shift in interest because women would have more well written characters they can relate to and stories that resonate with them.

Also switching to economics: when you already have all the data about viewership on certain gengres available why the heck you place your bet on the 1% chance that it might hit?

"The thing is, women know women, and women hate other women. There is nothing more catty and competitive to a cruel degree than that sex in particular. If women get into a hair pulling fight, they will grab, bite, pull hair, pull tits, bash, drag, and claw till someone pulls them away, or the other woman is unconscious, and even then the fight might keep going. Then they will hate and grudge against each other till the end of time. Guys on the other hand, will compete against each other, and when they get into a fight, will generally knock the other guy out, then maybe buy them a beer and become best buds afterwards. Respect is earned, the hierarchy is established and maintained, and peace is the end result. So movies about guys for guys tend to be better than movies about girls for girls.

"The thing to realise with Hollywood is that they benefit from movies no one wants to see. Producers and higher executives are paid using the film’s budget; it’s why they make disgusting amounts compared to the workers.  Doesn’t matter what it is; if the budget exists, they can pay themselves a bonus just for okaying the film. They push gender/race/regular politics because 1. It makes them look progressive and ahead of the curve to shareholders and 2. Because it’s so divisive now that it’s a great scapegoat for why films fail. The “you’re an ist” pejorative is a great way to excuse a film flopping which is why it became so popular, especially in 2019.  Anyone who complains about the film is made a scapegoat to hide shady tactics. Film budgets are exploding when film returns are diminishing simply because the higher the budget, the more they can pull in.

They’ve set it up so, win or loose, they make fuck you amounts of money. If the film over-performs, good. More for them to divy up. If it flops, good.  They write it off and pocket a lot of what’s left because of how film studios work. Titanic and Jurassic Park are legally complete gongs because they were produced through shell studios that then sent all the money to Warner. Therefor, the films never made a penny. It’s a system designed to insulate the money and give little to the directors which is why horror stories of directors never seeing a penny for thier projects exist. Hollywood survives because of private capital, ignorant shareholders,and because they produce so much content that it’ll make them profitable even if every single film they produce ends up like The Marvels. It’s called failing upward and it’s a disaster. 

Why does this problem exist? You can blame the collapsing middle class. In the 1920’s, anyone could make it on the stock market. Today, only the rich and richer can get anywhere due to the sheer price of stocks among other factors. How much control you have over a company is determined by the amount of shares you hold with the CEO almost always holding the most.. When the only people who can make it into movie studios are the “get rich by cutting throats” type, creativity dies. As George Lucas once said “companies used to be owned by people  who love film. Now they’re corporations. They don’t loves, they don’t go to movies. They don’t know what a movie is and they use focus groups to try to determine who will go see a movie. And Hollywood does that. They try to change the movie to fit what the polling was all about.”",[],2024-02-22T22:53:24Z,@lorddrayvon1426

"The ""girl boss"" trope is innately misandrist and has alienated the main audience for the films, resulting in commercial failure. The Barbie movie is also misandrist but appealed to the prejudice of its main audience and was spectacularly successful. The lesson is obvious: give audiences what they want and they will reward you handsomly, even if what you are selling is bigotry dressed as entertainment.

Sometimes audiences don't know what they want until they see it, which leaves room for experimentation, but how many times do you need to repeat an experiment to know that it is an abject failure?

What these studios fail to grasp is that women who actually watch the genre like, for the most part, every aspect of it. It feels weird when you make a female lead that acts like a male lead.

You are wrong when you imply that centrists saying ""the best female character is a character who happens to be a woman"" means that they\'re saying you can just slot any sex to a well written character. That\'s because you\'re purposefully leaving out the fact that a ""well written character"" takes into account not just the character\'s role and importance in the overall plot as you imply but all of their characteristics including believability and portrayal.\n\nI\'ll use an example: Percy Jackson & The Olympians. Could Rick Riordan have made Percy female and still had a perfectly good book? Not if he just changed the sex. Would Rick Riordan have to significantly change the plot to make a female Percy work? Maybe on a micro scale.

No one doubted that Sarah Conner was capable and smart... and no one doubted the Terminator's abilities... but the story hinged on the robot learning to be human and why we cry, while the scarred woman learned not to become an emotionless killing machine and to reclaim her humanity as a mother.","['Very well said. The first two Terminator movies, as well as the first Alien movies (and maybe also the third) were all able to tell stories about ordinary women rising to a challenge without ever ridiculing men. Then there’s films like Thelma & Louise, which are able to show ‘bad men’ without implying that all men are bad. I’m sure we’ll get films like that again.', ""Thats possibly the greatest summary of T2 i've read. Well said :)"", 'There was an explanation of how Sarah Conner became a girl boss. She didn\'t just become one magically out of thin air. She was a young, naive and trusting in the first film and then all hell broke loose. She learned from it, learned that bad things were coming, realized that she had to train hard, work hard, build some muscles, learn how to fight and shoot and she became jaded because no one believed her warnings, everyone just kept walking around like sheep, she was disgusted by everyone because they were as clueless as she used to be.\n\nToday? All the girl bosses are just born girl bosses. That helps ""the message"" in that we must believe all women are perfect from the get-go and thus must never learn anything because they already know it because they are so wise. OK, but that doesn\'t make for much of a story.', 'Yeah! Sarah is a great character in both T1 and 2 , id say very different in both but great and relatable. \n\nAnother is Ripley from Alien franchise \n, these two are great examples of strong female characters and keep saing it when it comes to the boss babe topic. \nThese two are characters not trying to prove anything, they just do what they got to do.', 'This was my favorite film as a kid. At the time, as an 8 year old, I don’t think I could have articulated the philosophical point you made, but I knew it. It’s why I also love ‘The Fifth Element’.

The actor stated with confidence that there is a network of feminist ideologues who are at the highest levels of influence, run by an entity codenamed: The Broker. Apparently, this individual or group of individuals are intentionally trying to inject this feminazi bullshit much to the dismay of investors, audiences, and everyone in between. Now, I will be the first to admit that ""The Broker"" sounds a bit hyperbolic and, well... fabricated. But at the same time, I also 100% believe that there is an uncanny level of coordination between these different projects at different film studios, where it all lines up a little too perfectly for it to be a coincidence. And these feminist writers/directors/producers who all run under the same flag all seem to write themselves into the movie they're making. I don't believe in ""The Broker"" like this anonymous actor reported, but I do believe in the network they're all reporting under.

"This was my point that I wrote in comments here and under nerdrotic clip. Barbie wroked so well cause it is female-oriented material made by female for female. I believe someone created ""modern audience"" on some strategy-house slides, presented that to boards that believed that they will make more money and also make sort of ""woke-washing"". Which ensures that leftists will not target such companies and allow them to do what they want to do with employees.
I will point out one thing - If there is around 25% males on female productions (and otherwise) it doesn't mean you have a potential to grow that part of audience. It is important who drives a decision to go to cinema and watch that movie. For example - I am sometimes viewer of some romantic comedy - my wife's turn to choose a movie. Next time I will take her on Dune 2, which is not interesting choice for her :). But she has to go. But there is no chance that she will choose such movie on her own even if Paul Atrida will turn himself into girlboss. 
It is ok to make some good female characters in male oriented type of movies. We had those ""decorators"" type of characters in old Bond movies and it is not what we want.

His point was that women would rather watch Housewives of wherever tear each other down than five women working to together.  Men, on the other hand,  work together extremely well.  Both of these conditions are probably a result of biology.  Men hunted and to be successful in a hunt you had better work together or everbody dies.

Now after watching them stick with the same exact recipe flop after flop after flop it doesn't look like they're interested in making money. It seems like they are dead set on catering to an extremely small (but vocal) part of the population which doesn't really work well when it comes to making huge budget movies.,"[""There's the problem with capitalism: the consumer has choices and if you don't give them what they want they will go elsewhere.

"Until the lockdown, my best friend and I used to go to the cinema 2 or 3 times a month. We would see a wide variety of different genres but we especially loved superhero films. The reasons for that? Well, women like eye candy just as much as men do so all the gorgeous guys were a big attraction at the start. But we wouldn't have continued going to see each new installment if we hadn't enjoyed everything about the films themselves, not just the cast. We went to see the first Aquaman because of Jason Momoa but thought it was awful so didn't go to see the second one. We also enjoy a good action film, so loved Maverick. Saying that, we're big fans of Tom Cruise and never miss one of his films, especially the MI series. Initially, we went to see some 'girl boss' films but quickly decided we were wasting our money. I was so disappointed with Oceans 8 because normally I really like Sandra Bullock, but thought the film itself was dreadful. Now, if it's a cast full of women, that screams ""don't bother"" to us. We never bothered with Barbie (even Ryan Gosling couldn't tempt us) but we have friends who loved it and kept telling us to go see it, but we just didn't want to.

.
Mizu from Blue Eye Samurai, Evelyn from Everything Everywhere all at once and Kim Wexler from BCS.

All of this character has stories on their own and their reason to be “strong” not just the plot.

Mizu is a skilled Samurai who seeks vengeance, yet she is not that perfect, her fiery hatred often brought her in near-death situation or absolutely dead if she is not getting rescued by her friends that she didn’t care.
.
Evelyn in every universe, no matter she is the chef, action star, hot-dog fingers person or a rock, she is the strong woman, who wants to control everything, including her own daughter, as the reason why her daughter becomes the antagonist.
.
Kim Wexler is a smart woman, she can even outsmart Lalo in order to save Saul, yet her wits are the main problem of her downfall with Saul
.

"One of my favourite characters growing up was Evie from ""The Mummy"". I related to her a lot: our love of Egypt, reading, and being a little clumsy (lol). Evie was strong in her own ways and supported the other characters where they lacked. They were a team. And where she lacked, she asked for help.

"So interesting to see the figures! Also shows that my instinct is correct to find a male co-writer for my show, so we have both perspectives, especially as the main character is a man.

Personally, I'm a woman with a preference for fantasy, historical drama and superhero stuff. I also like action movies and sci-fi, but to a lesser degree. I do know a good deal of women who like fantasy and historical stuff and are also a bit into superheroes, but I've noticed that some of them do focus on the love relationships in these genres. Not necessarily my cup of tea to dwell too much on it unless I'm freshly infatuated (been a while), although I think it's important for character depth to show the relationship if they have one. But seems to confirm the figures here.

In any case, I've never had issues with male heroes, I think it's just outright wrong to assume that an audience can only relate to characters that are like them on a superficial level like gender, age or cultural background. It's the beauty of fiction to allow us to walk in someone else's shoes for a while and to safely dip into the experience of things we likely won't ever experience in our own lives and often don't even want to experience in our physical reality, yet it expands our lives and horizons. I do relate to characters who have some trait in common with me, preferably a character trait. But I usually become the biggest fan of characters who are very different from me, but touch me in some way on a deeper level (often an antagonist or villain with a vulnerable aspect). Then, there is a difference between relating to and sympathising with a character and admiring them. 

But for me, it doesn't really matter if relatable or admirable characters are men or women. The only difference is if I find them erotically attractive - which, by the way, is something often appreciated by women: looking at male bodies in action. ;)","['Agreed with everything. \n\nAnd yes, men doing manly stuff and using their powerhouses they have for bodies make many women swoon ... or at least catch their interest.

"Alien, Wonder Woman, Kill Bill, Underworld, Tomb Raider, Atomic Blonde, Salt,  Lucy,  The Hunger Games, Alita, Resident Evil, Prey,  Hanna, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Scream, Halloween, etc.. all made money and all with female leads.

"The studios try very hard to establish powerful women (actually to force them upon us). Why, I don't understand. There has been a lot of powerful women roles in the past in almost every genre (even without sexualization) ... and nobody complained. The problem is... that know men are degraded to sissies to upgrade the womens status in their respective roles and underline their prowess.... again, totally unnecessary.  Best example is the aliens series. Sigourney Weaver plays the mother of all powerful women without ridiculing the involved male characters. And she rocks the role with her charisma and all-around presence which is, and that's the very important part, carried by an awesome story. So... stop searching for excuses why movies with leading female roles bomb at the office. The answer is easy: the stories lack originality, credibility, continuity and common sense and often disrespect the source material (Echo would have had such potential if they would have taken the slightest clues on the Daredevil-Series while staying true to the source material instead of changing everything about the character to fit in some agendas nobody asked for). AND: most the respective actresses have the same screen credibility as an empty coffee mug. So instead of blaming the audience for not understanding the message or the movie itself... think about what the audience expects. Stop trying to forcefeed us your bullshit. Stop wasting our time and money. Stop denying the inevitable truth that nobody cares what executives think is the right move when clearly it's not... and actually start using this underrated thing in your skull which you forgot to use for anything else than counting money: your brain.",[],2024-02-22T09:57:49Z,@Midnite7175

Here's a more radical idea: **Just have a freaking story WORTH telling.** Don't even think about Gender or whatever the hell. Just go outside, have some adventures, and genuinely, authentically **have a story to tell.**

My wife and I were watching the Netflix Anthony Bourdain documentary a few days ago. Despite our different genders, we both loved his works because he was so damn authentic all the time, and he actually wanted to share stories from his various life experiences.

While Drinker is right here that people do some preferences at a macro level, I believe authenticity and thoughtful creation will outweigh any such considerations. Pixar used to be an outstanding example at this.

"Plenty of my friends are women and while we're interested in Some different things there is always more than enough intersection. Hell, most of them like even more sex and violence than I do. The critical thing for most women I know (even more then for most men) is that a story has to make sense and the characters have to be interesting and likable. Women tend to be way more wired into social dynamics and subtlety then men (on average). So throwing a crap story with crap characters and no character arc will piss them off, girl-boss or no. Look at the female reviewers for this, or for the live action Mulan or Velma or whatever. 

These movies aren't failing because they're 'catering to women'. They're failing for the same reason why 60s 'catering to women' stuff failed (hey, we'll put women in bikinis hugging some dude's knee-cap, women like that, right?). They're failing because they aren't Actually catering to 'modern audiences', or women, or whatever - they're just trying to milk those audiences for easy-cash by having 'strong female characters'. When the Actual 'modern audiences' want Actual well-rounded characters, with arks, with plots, with failings to overcome.. just like men do. Euphoria and Shameless were shows that were Loved by women. All the female characters were super-flawed and broken. Game of Thrones (S1-6) did super well with both men and women. Encanto. Hunger Games. Tomb Raider.

""Modern audiences"", and women (who are not ""modern"", I promise everyone women have existed just as long as men, at a more or less 50/50 ratio of the human species), like good movies.

"I don't know.  I feel there is a very real danger here i dont I think the message should be women can only be confined to the Barbie rom com relationship genres.  There are many women star wars fans who prefer the original trilogy over the pandering nonsense of Disney.  The main message cannot be we should create gender segregated generes and give up challenging stereotypes completely.  I think a more nuanced solution o
Is to make Smart nuanced 3 dimensional characters period who are genuinely likeable.  Women can be Strong and feminine in a way that doesn't have to either put down men or present them as perfect ""mary sues"". Madame web in her cringe movie says to The girls something like i see your futures and you grow up. X y or z just like i knew you could... There is zero character development for any of the girls and Madame web doesn't even like them for most of the movie.  Its a cringe message written shoehorned in at the end to pander to a female audience. Its a corporate mistep thinking this is what people want to hear.  Pandering is a poor substitute for actual depth and character development The solution is more creativity 3 dimensional characters not gender segregation. Women don't have to hate or dismiss men as irrelevant which is a trend in Hollywood now.  The issue ISN'T women can't or should not be in action movies the issue is the kinds of women who are being created are turn offs for everyone.   Aoywynn was a fine character in lord of the Rings. She was 3 dimensional had emotional depth and she did fight as well seemed real felt grief. Leia was a 'strong female character"" but completely believable shes both rescued in the first movie and rescues han in the last movie.  Again no one disliked her.  Padme too strong character intelligent a senator and also fought when she had to in episode ii. What do both padme and Leia have in common they both love and care about the men in their lives.  They experience pain have emotional stakes fear conflicts.  The message of the Barbie movie is women SHOULD not be like thpse characters anymore because that is weakness and supports an imaginary patriarchy.  Princess in disney movies NOW need no prince.  Love is weakness being rescued is weakness.  Being strong means being confident narcissist and little else. Women should NOT be emotional or care about men it gets in the way of their alleged self actualization.  That may be popular in a movie like Barbie design to pander to THAT audience.  I hope that THAT Audience doesn't represent all women though.  If it does society itself has larger problems.

"There's just a fact they have to deal with: Men like the violence, women don't. Men are obsessed with conflict and fighting and enjoy the thrill of battle, most women don't. At best you have some that views fighting as an unfortunate necessity. Yes, some women do enjoy what men do, keyword: SOME! Just like how Romance genre movies are primarily viewed by women, but some men do enjoy them as well. Again keyword: SOME men do. It's not impossible to mix and blend these things together to appeal to a wider audience but you still have to take into account what each side enjoys more on a general side. Put most of the male cast in the action scenes and the female cast in the emotional scenes so each side can relate to the interests that appeals to them. It's why people STILL LOVE the dashing knight/prince saving the beautiful princess trope. This is human nature, not assigned roles, despite how much they love to shove that bullshit down everyone's throats.

And the thing is it's even impossible to do entirely led female led action projects. Literally the entire Magical Girl genre is built on it, but you know what they do different? They add more emotional themes and arcs into them, making less action oriented and that works just fine because you have women acting like women. Winx Club, W.I.T.C.H, Sailor Moon, all perfect examples that balance interpersonal relationships and drama with exciting action scenes. And unsurprisingly those shows have a dedicated female audience, either to the point they are the main demographic or equal with the male audience. These people just need to accept that men and women are completely wired differently amongst the mass majority across the entire world and no matter which side of the planet you go to, it'll be the same. There are exceptions, but they're not the example that discredits the common held beliefs. And they're not going to change just because you don't like it and want to try and force your world view in everyone's faces showing how it ""should"" be. And the world is better for that, imagine how boring it'd be if men and women had the same tastes and preferences.

"There's a manga series from 2009 called ""Bakuman"" that addressed the pandering issue before it even became an issue. The lead characters are a pair of guys who work as an artist/writer duo, producing comics for ""Shonen Jump"", Japan's top-selling manga magazine. For context, Japan has dozens of manga magazines aimed at a wide array of different demographics, and Shonen Jump is primarily targeted at teenage boys.

When the duo's first manga series starts struggling with low ratings, they make a rookie mistake and try to write their next arc to appeal more to female fans, focusing too much on their protagonist's romantic life and daily experiences. Their editor shoots the idea down bluntly as soon as he sees the storyboards with these words: ""Shonen Jump has a lot of female fans, and that's great. Your manga has more female readers than average for a Shonen Jump series, and that's fine. But you have to remember that you're being published in a magazine aimed specifically at boys. Any girls who do choose to read our magazine are girls who specifically like boys' manga anyway.""

"I think the reason why girl boss characters don't sell is because creators don't allow them to hit rock bottom.
Everyone can relate to the experience of hitting rock bottom, and everyone wants to rise from the bottom to top.
And the catharsis that comes from that is greater the lower the character falls.
That's why I love Spider-Man the most. 
But a girl boss character is not allowed to have that kind of hardship or crisis, so it's harder to get the audience to empathize or feel that catharsis.
Like in She-Hulk, the hardest moments in the protagonist's life are being catcalled and conflict at work, and overcoming these problems doesn't provide enough catharsis for the audience.","[""Yeah, i do not mind a female lead.

"One thing I did like in Top Gun Maverick, was that there was a female pilot in the group, but the movie never went down the path that so many movies lately would have gone because she existed in the movie. She was treated as a real character, I remember one other character taking a dig at her, but she shut him down and was just part of the team, and her gender never played a part in anything plot wise. She was just another top gun pilot, there because she was the best of the best, at the school to learn and prove herself (like everyone else who was there).

I remember mentioning this to my wife after the movie finished, because it was so weird lately to have a movie which just treated all the characters as actual characters, not just standins for whatever message they were trying to tell. I think the biggest failing the studios are making in trying to bring in more female viewers is that they fail to make characters at all that require more than a sentence to explain all their character traits.

Take the reading community for example. There are quite a lot of fantasy book series with ""badass"" female leads that are insanely popular among female readers, but nearly EVERY SINGLE ONE has some kind of romance that is the main draw, meaning that there is ALSO a male lead to complement the female protagonist. Even speaking as a woman who really doesn't care for romantasy stories and just wants a good adventure whether the main character is a boy or a girl, I'm not at all attracted to the whole ""female protagonist with male traits"" thing.

"One piece of media that I thinks effectively balances male and female characters that are both badass and are human is ""Chuck""(2007-2012). All three main characters have great strengths that make them heroic but also are the source of their flaws, similar to Hercules and his strength. Chuck (Zach Levi) is a computer geek who is charming, intelligent, and brave  who loves his family and friends. However, his emotions can lead him to be childish, mopey, and meek, putting people and the missionat hand in danger. Much of his character devlopement is him becoming a hero dedicated to serving a higher purpose in life. Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski) is a baddass beautiful spy. She is deadly and smart, able to pick locks, pilot a plane, and a defuse bomb. She even took on Michael Clark Duncan in a fight winning through use of agility and deception rather than strenght. However, her profession has turned her into a cold and ruthless killer- a tool used by the government who is left isolated in the world by being forced to erect emotional barriers to survive. Much of her development is dedicated to her dream to live a normal married life with real friends and family. Finally, Casey (Adam Baldwin) is the standard, tatically brilliant, quippy NSA agent/ Marine who loves guns and Ronald Reagan. Basically he is an 80s action star. However, like Sarah he has no meaninful relationships and as the show develops he establishes genuine connections with people, without losing his killer edge. In short, ""Chuck"" was able to present a nuanced point of view demonstrating that being a badass is cool but comes with a price of a normal life. This allowed the audience to root for, symotahize with, and at times disagree with the characters without despising them. Even two veteran badass actors, Linda Hamliton (Sarah Conner) and Timothy Dalton (James Bond) have recurring roles in the show. Furthermore, ""Chuck"" effectively blends romance, comedy, action, sci-fi, and drama in one entertaining show. All characters, regardless of gender, have their strenghts and weaknesses allowing both men and women watching something to love. I think ""Chuck"" can be a blueprint for future shows to replicate.",[],2024-02-22T05:00:49Z,@michaelkfoury9467

"No, it's not the end of the girlboss and wokeness... they know exactly why they aren't making any money on these movies, and they don't care.

You constantly seem to skip over the possibility that the ""illogical"" behaviour of the studios might have some logic, but not one that's immediately obvious to us outside of the top levels of the industry.

The logic is - we live in a post-profit world of business where huge corporations don't mind losing billions of dollars - because they're using this money and their products to shape future generations of consumers.

The studios themselves are rich beyond belief, and their investors have not billions but tens of trillions of dollars to use to create the way people will see the world.

They aren't accidentally destroying legacy characters in all the franchises at the same time. Those characters shaped how generations of men and women saw good and evil and what they aspired to become.

Yes, these new movies iritate a lot of us older dudes, but they are not made for us to see, they aren't made to generate profit, they are made to completely sever the link between the generations. 

Soon, there won't be movies in the classical sense. Everything produced by big business will be AI generated, heavily curated theme rides of escapist fantasy with no meaning or lesson. 

This era is just the transition period during which cinema and other arts will die, storytelling will die and it will be replaced by total corporate control over human desire for adventure, imagination, creativity.

Yes, corporate control. 

Not neo-marxist or woke or whatever. Those quasi-communists and neo-marxists are just corporate shills paid to add a veneer of empathy and equality to a future that will be completely run by IT giants, rich people and power-hungry politicians.",[],2024-02-22T04:35:56Z,@bojovic78

"The solution is simple enough.  Just start catering to what the audiences actually want/expect from movies.  i.e. a good story that allows character development and satisfying conclusion.  Trying to regurgitate the same tired, old tropes revolving around the idea of, 'girl power', placing females into male roles, whilst simultaneously taking every opportunity to belittle and denigrate any and all male characters within, purely because they're male, whilst elevating all the female characters to being perfect, with the only flaw being males in their way, that need to be dealt with, isn't what audiences want to see, especially in practically every movie released within certain genres.  It's been done to death and no-one's interested in it, and never really was.

As a one-off, 'subverting expectations', movie, it might have been deemed passable.  But when it's the same thing done over and over and over again, despite the ratings for such movies not doing at all well, then you know it's more about, 'the message', than what the movies are supposedly about.  People have become ultra-sensitive to this now, and even the slightest whiff of, 'girl power', is enough to put people off.  Having scenes within established franchises that are eye-rolling cringy, is bad enough, but when they start making multiple entire movies that seeming do nothing but push, 'the message', then what do they really expect to happen?

Do they think everyone is going to suddenly have an epiphany, and realise how wrong they've been not to embrace the whole, 'girl power', thing?  Or, are they more likely to take one look at whatever image they use to promote the movie, with cinema-goers responding with a definitive, 'nope', to the idea of even entertaining the notion of going to see it, at all?  We all know the answer to that one.",[],2024-02-22T04:29:05Z,@j0hnf_uk

A good example of sticking to the source material or the original concept is the Elden Ring  game when it released many western game company studio and critics hated MIyazaki and his Fromsoftware studio. They can't accept the fact that Elden Ring sold millions with no hidden micro transaction such as loot box and more, they cant accept the fact that Miyazaki stayed true to the concept of the game instead of copying what western company like Ubisoft, Blizzard and others are doing and still sold millions.

The reason this keeps happening is because the left wing ideologues firmly believe that you can transform and shift society into certain preferences.

"The thing I always take away from a critical and thorough/thoughtful analysis is not so much the issue of where the problems themselves come from it's can we get rid of sorce of them now. We've got companies full to the brim with activists and with very little actual creative skill as demonstrated by pretty much any script these days. Like a tick or a tapeworm or some kind of parasite they've buried themselves deep into the system removing anyone who would contradict them or not allow them to push their agendas and politics freely. We've heard the Bob Igger's saying that even though they weren't going to try to push politics anymore behind the scenes they actually will continue to do so even more than they did. I am truly concerned that we can get back on any kind of track without a massive purge and a complete reorganization of Hollywood and the industry. The problem is I just don't see that happening these people are too deep in the system and they've done too much damage already. I don't even think they care about what they're doing as far as making a product it's almost like most of what they care about is just tearing everything down and destroying the past. It is going to take an awful lot to tell me that we're anywhere close to back on track like we were nearly 5 years ago.

As invincible he seems on the battle field he's also reckless and got caught a few times. The woman he got to help him not only saved his arse but helped him get to his daughter in time. She was just as much integral to the story as he was.
The only exemption from this was Steven Segal, which coincidentally seems to be who girl bosses are modelled after.

They think black people are inferior and under represented, so they show blacks being superior and over represented. They think gays have been shamed in to obscurity, so they are making gay characters as loud and gay as possible. They think women are weaker than men and less competent than men on a host of issues, so they depict women as hyper competent at all things while being stronger than men.

"I think it goes even beyond liking certain genres. For example, my girlfriend likes a lot of the MCU movies, especially the ""Thor"" ones (definitely playing a part in that is that Chris Hemsworth is her biggest ""celebrity crush"").

And guess what? She didn't care for ""The Marvels"" either. And why would she?

It's like those reports (that are hopefully inaccurate) about studio executives looking at the success of ""Barbie"" and coming to the conclusion that they should greenlight more movies based on toys.... as if +that+ was such an important element of the big box office.

And it's kinda similar regarding the idea of just shoving women into movies, without having good scripts and interesting characterization... and still expect female audiences to show up in large numbers, simply +because+ there are female leads.

This can obviously also be applied to something like having lead characters of other ethnicities/skin colours. Something like ""Fast & Furious"" works because while the ""diversity"" was noticeable, it didn't feel too forced.

(And this works the other way around as well. e.g. international productions which have the vast majority of its cast being ""foreign"" ... but cast some white Hollywood actor (quite often: b- or c-listers) in it for the sake of small name recognition and having a white star in it. Which also very often feels forced and weird)

I guess my point simply being: Something like ""The Marvels"" (or ""Madame Web"") might at least have worked significantly better if the studio had taken the time to actually gave the audiences (and maybe female audiences in particular) actual reasons to care about it.","[""My ex gf's favorite movies were LOTR.

"Well said! As someone who's been working in marketing for 16 years, and having 4 in promoting film and TV content, I've always gotten the feeling that a good number of films were made without having done any market research. They don't know who exactly is their target market, or if there's enough of them to make it profitable.

Madame Web and the Sony Spider-verse was doomed from the start. Trying to make a cinematic universe around Spider-Man without actually having him in any of them is plain stupid. Nobody cares enough about the Sinister Six to want to see a film franchise revolved around them. Venom and Morbius would actually get a fair chance at succeeding if they were helmed by people who actually understood the characters. But instead we got a PG-13 Venom turned buddy comedy instead of a gritty, ruthless and amoral anti-hero. Where Morbius could have had a dark, gothic horror setting, it's turned into yet another generic and forgettable superhero. 

The funny part is, it's not like Sony was completely failing at it. The people who did the Miles Morales Spider-Verse movies were doing it far better than anything the Disney MCU was churning out in the last 5 years. Why didn't the execs behind Morbius and Madame Web learn something from those instead?","[""The sad thing is that Madame Web could have setup a great series of movies featuring The Inheritors, yet doesn't seem to have succeeded at that.

Loki is a male super hero who is very popular with female viewers. The problem isn’t having strong female leads, but the fact that the current writers have no idea how to do that. Look at books as opposed to films, there we have a just as many strong females as males, and there isn’t the same problems. Did you ever stop to think that maybe an industry that went from me too to pandering to women and always showing them on top, might be over compensating? They might just be, rather than actually showing their true feminist values, just showing how totally okay with women we are now 😜.  If they wanted to put forward feminist values they would put forward feminist values from today, not ones from the 70’s. I swear there isn’t a single person in Hollywood that has read a current feminist book, and instead of addressing that you’re basically saying that films should be segregated? No. This is that same B.S that women should be watching romance and men should be watching action. All of that is so old fashioned and honestly media should be better then that, and so should we.","[""I've saw where you said you were disabled, did you mean mentally disabled?

Targeted media is always very derivative why can’t we get something a little more complicated? Is it too much to ask that maybe there is something in between? Maybe just maybe a woman doesn’t need to be a damsel in distress or a girl boss and a man doesn’t need to be an action hero or a cowering mess. Maybe if major studios started writing people more true to real life then a lot of this would become less of an issue, because it isn’t when I’m reading books, and to be honest it isn’t an issue when I’m watching movies that aren’t American, or even produced by a major Hollywood studio.  @@SupremeBeyonder']",2024-02-22T02:29:58Z,@alisontheanimal4009

"One of my favorite movies, and one of my favorite quotes in that movie, I believe, applies to this topic of conversation.

In the movie, La La Land, Mia tells Sebastian “people love what other people are passionate about..” that statement is absolutely true. You don’t have to belittle anyone or ostracize any part of your audience in order for them to find your product appealing. You simply have to produce a product that you truly love and are passionate about and people will flock to it, and spend their hard earned money for it. Regardless, if they are male or female. Take music, for example. I can’t tell you how many concerts I’ve gone to where I assumed that because of the nature of the music being played, there would be more of one sex than the other in attendance only to show up and find out that both men and women can enjoy the same style of music equally. Both men and women were in the mosh pit, shoving each other just for fun and fucks sake. And it doesn’t seem like the artist up on stage is trying to pander to one more than the other. They’re simply playing what they love, and they are sharing that with others and people like myself have shown up and purchased tickets with our hard earned money to enjoy the product.

Movie studios used to be about this. They used to be about making films that were passionate and made with love. They weren’t thinking about pandering to women only or to men only. You could honestly say that the original lion King panders to both men and women. And even to children, which is why it is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The themes could be applied to any sex and to any age. And all sexes love this movie equally. 

I’m not for putting either sex on a pedestal. I don’t believe men should be put on a pedestal, and I don’t believe women should be put on a pedestal. We’re different than one another, but we are both deserving of dignity and respect. Marvel studios should aim to make movies that treat both their male and female audience with respect and dignity. Men are strong and capable, and so are women, but we just go about it differently and there’s nothing wrong with that. Marvel Studios needs to go back to making superhero movies, about flawed superhuman characters that have to STRUGGLE with legitimate internal and external issues, and have to fight to overcome those odds against all odds and us, as an audience, can see their transformation on screen, and perhaps even walk away, inspired to do the same in our own lives. The greatest movies ever made are those that have had a transformative experience on their audience.

"If they would stop trying to make movies ""for men"" or ""for women"" and instead focused on making.. I dunno... A GOOD MOVIE, then they wouldn't have to worry about overanalyzing the audience demographics to try to crack some nonexistant code.  People aren't going to see these movies because they suck.  Period.  I know I'm in the minority, but as a woman I used to really enjoy action and superhero movies, and now they are unwatchable.  It's like you say, it's the relentless PANDERING that is taking center stage, and any attempt at making a ""superhero"" or ""action"" movie comes second to that.

I think she made the mistake of coming at Kurt when he was not too tired to keep on hunting so even though we had energy to still swat at a toy instead she offered her hand to pet him and he was too riled up and also on catnip. Try again, and make sure he's good and tired out before you try to pet him. Also, maybe offer your hand lower or from behind him when he's tired, so it does not look like you're still trying to get him to swat at your hand. Another thing try sitting quietly.

Instead of a murder mystery, we get a first year sociology lecture about misogyny, race, gender, lesbians, domestic violence, and mental health.

A great example is Star Trek Voyager with Captain Janeway vs Star Trek Discovery with Michael Burnam. One is beloved and the other is… ummm… there…,"['One is a leader, who commands her ship with good training, a strong force of will, and a decent amount of logic (Janeway). The other is a psychopath and borderline Mary Sue who in any actual organization like Starfleet would have been arrested and locked up for the crap she pulls (Burned Ham).', ""And i found funny how they took an already inclusive IP with plenty of diversity, and just extremized all this inclusion to a point of not being inclusive anymore.\n\nEvery old star trek had great strong female characters, a crew of all different ethnicities and characters you could relate with (Obrian i love you).\nDiscovery have just a girlboss not human deus ex captain who does everything, everyone it's gay, inclusion = black people, and everyone just cry and have emotional breakdown. There is not a single characters i could relate with. The doctor or data are more human than the whole cast of discovery"", 'Captain Janeway is the best written “strong female” lead IMO. Absolutely loved voyager growing up', ""STD is a bit of an std that you can't get rid of..."", ""Don't forget about Seven of Nine! A great character played by an awesome actress! (And I'm a straight female, so no, not dazzled by her ... assets). \n\nI'd throw in Kira Nerys and Jadzia Dax into the mix, too. They were awesome female characters in Trek, too. Voyager had its issues, but what I liked is that Janeway was never put on a pedestal. She made questionable decisions, and was challenged on it. \n\nI have not seen discovery, but the snippets were enough. Also, why is she called Michael?! What's the point of that?! She was raised by Vulcans. Certainly to them it's illogical to have a male name for a female as that just causes confusion.""]",2024-02-22T01:24:01Z,@thepumpboy

"Having a strong female character and a strong male character and treat them equally isn't enough. Let's not forget the fundamentals : good script, good actors, good director and team.
Case point : The not-really-good 80's movie ""Red Sonja"".
So, yep, let's not forget that Hollywood started experimenting with the ""strong female lead"" formula a long time ago, with widely varying degrees of success.

Also, Hollywood should finally understand that having an all-female team behind the scenes do not magically equal to a great success, whether it's on TV or the big screen. You also need someone who understands the target audience.
Case point : Darren Star, who's very much a guy, was the driving force behind some of the most popular TV series among women.

"Disney has always made Princess movies and thought it never needed to do anything else. When it purchased new franchises, it assumed they could just make more Princess movies. The problem is that their Princess movies were always really written poorly. The only they had going for them, and the only thing that carried them, was the music. The writers were there just to tie the songs together. Disney assumed it could swap music sets with action pieces and nobody would notice. They still refuse to learn how to write. THIS I think is the main problem. Certainly, the gender wars play a part but it's symptomatic and not the main problem.

"I worked in Hollywood studios from 1999-2019. Here’s what’s gone wrong : in the old days , a studio boss or the executive shepherding the project HAD TO LIKE IT - seriously; it didn’t have to be “Citizen Kane” but they had to really dig it on some level. (Audiences were not ignored : of course there were always test screenings - but the idea was “how do we make the thing WE like into something THEY love?”). Then, around 2013, someone decided “we don’t have to like the project, we need to convince ourselves they THEY will like it - so we’ll just change how we think !”. And the problem with that is : when nobody on the team really truly likes the project, everyone goes home at 5pm and you end up where we are now…❤","['Interesting, thank you for the insight into the industry.', 'or woke marxism tropes    either or', ""It's like Norm Macdonald said, in order to do a good parody, you have to like the person.

"It's not about men or women's preferences. It's about genuinity. When you go out of your way to try to pander to ANY audience, the product starts to feel artificial and formulaic. Top Gun is ""We're gonna write a story about a man being a man in a man's world,"" not ""let's capitalize on male audiences."" Lots of women LOVE Top Gun. Maverick isn't some infallable, inhumanly perfect, epitome of ultimate manhood. He's just a regular dude who has a tendency to push the envelope but has a well-intentioned heart. That's a realistic, genuine character. Hell, he's even visibly shorter than a lot of other guys in the series and gets thrown out of a bar by a boss woman character lol. There's not a poorly-camoflauged narrative of trying to prove some bigger point like ""Men are superior"" or some bs. It's just a fun story that's not trying to be anything more than a fun story, and that's the genuinity we've been missing from Marvel and Disney these past years. I think Hallmark movies are cheesy, but the same principle of just being a fun story applies there too, and they're practically a staple in our society now.

This new-age ""free love, strength in diversity, female empowerment"" movement has a philosophy of trying to use every platform possible to bluntly assert itself, and decrying any platforms that won't submit. Even death metal music of all places took a hit last summer when Thy Art Is Murder's singer got fired for making a public stance against parents who convince their young children to be trans. It used to be a genre of young, dumb, ignorant kids writing the most vulgar, obscene, misogynistic, edgy lyrics to over-the-top brutal, technical, heavy music. We loved it, not because we ""agreed"" with the lyrics or anything, but because everyone knew it wasn't serious and was just a genre about having light-hearted fun making ridiculous music. Thy Art's breakout song in like 2006 was literally called ""Whore to a Chainsaw"" lolol, and it fing slaps. My point is that this operational philosophy of ""It's the girl's/gay's/other color's/[fill in the blank]'s turn now, time for the white hetero cis men to leave"" has caused the same problems in a lot of spaces, superhero films only being one of them.

In the realm of heavy music, we love bands like Spiritbox and Jinjer, which are female-lead bands that still just try to make good music and don't pander to ""girl's turn"" bs or call of their haters misyongists. Meanwhile, Butcher Babies has become irrelevant because ""LOOK AT OUR HOT SINGERS"" was literally the only thing going for them. Their riffs suck and their music isn't fresh at all, and no social justice movement has come to save them. The former are genuinely good bands, the latter is genuinely not, and in a genuine game, that's just how it goes. That's the idea Hollywood's strayed away from. That's the game this movement disrupts.",[],2024-02-22T00:32:12Z,@isaacyoder4137

"Thing is, both audiences like good storytelling. All the women I know love LOTR and Braveheart, although admittedly the male leads may have an influence. 💪🏻. 70 yo male here, and I can enjoy a well crafted romance ( struggles to think of one ). 
They used to do it so well. Mrs Miniver got six Oscars, back when they meant something ( 1942 ), for a very simple story written around one woman, not poor, who held a family and a community together in 1940 England, with Dunkirk as a theme. Strong, female lead, who had weaknesses and tears, male co actors who were in no way diminished by her leadership, and a tight, well written script. Propaganda? Possibly, but lifting the spirits of a battered people is OK in my book.

"I believe a big part of this is feminism and the need to latch onto anything that is popular JUST because it's popular. And they continue to absorb anything they can get their paws onto in hopes of grasping more power. And then it fails because it turns out they know nothing about it or what made it into what it was. Although at least on a smaller scale on more individual level I believe a part of this because certain females latch onto these things in search for a sense of belonging. It's a bit awkward liking things that are prominently liked by the opposite sex. And then when people say it's primarily for the opposite sex it makes you think you don't belong there and you're the weird one. But instead of just accepting that you're the odd one out, they instead try to prove people wrong by getting all women to like it.

"I honestly think that at the root of all this is the belief that women can be socially engineered into wanting to major in STEM subjects.

See, the wizards behind the curtain only really worry about men abandoning higher education, because modern society is built on science, technology, engineering and math, and they're very worried enough people aren't pursuing those disciplines. If we don't have enough engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and the like, a prosperous society we won't have. Keeping this house of cards upright requires people, mostly men, with STEM degrees who can seemingly do magic to mere mortals and can create a flying machine with some wood, rags, and a few other items out in the garage.

Well, because these _wizards behind the curtain_ trying to run society are often the same people who believe gender differences are socially engineered, it's no stretch to also conclude they'd think that the reason men sought out those subjects was because entertainment that focused on science and technology was male dominated. I'm certain they thought if they made shows with a bunch of _girlbosses_ then maybe girls would seek out STEM degrees. If girls got STEM degrees, it wouldn't matter to society if men were going GALT in western culture.

Probably because she likes watching competent male heroes kick ass as much as men do. 3) My favorite ""nerd property"" media of the last 5 years has probably been Arcane - which on paper is inclusive to excess, but nothing feels shoehorned because the writing is so good and the characters are all interestingly flawed.  I guess my point is less ""let boys be boys and girls be girls"", but make quality films with smart writing and compelling characters and stories, and you're going to find that more of both genders gravitate towards those regardless of genre.  And JHC, yes, women writers are fully able to write stories that appeal to everyone, and the assumption that they can't is one studios (and critics) need to stop making.",[],2024-02-22T00:01:34Z,@djgizmoe

"I think a major cause of this is also the increasing success of asian content at the detriment of the Hollywood stuff.

 Hear me out: you can think all you want of k-dramas or anime, but they make big numbers today. In the past, hell five years ago even, you could say there was no competition. But distribution has changed, and when the money men at Amazon see that people would rather watch the new k-drama of the day than Rings of Power on Prime, they're bound to ask themselves some questions.

 With anime is the same thing. What do they have that western products don't? Two words: target demographics. Traditionally entertainment, at least in Japan, caters to groups of consumers based on their age, gender and interests. So much so, that even genres are named according to that (""shojo"" probably being the most famous example).

So the lesson for West entertainment is: if you refuse to give the people what they want, somebody else will.","[""Shounen is the common style of manga or anime that appeals to adolescent boys and young men and makes up the majority of Japanese heavy hitters. Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Naruto, Pokemon, and Demon Slayer are all shounen. They typically boil down to power fantasy and overcoming the odds. Think Goku vs. Frieza.\n\nShoujo is more like Cardcaptor Sakura, Ranma 1/2, or Sailor Moon. They're shows or comics meant for adolescent girls and young women. All of those that I mentioned were quite popular, each getting some kind of international release, though Sailor Moon is easily the heavy hitter there. \nShoujo stories are usually more character focused than shounen. Sailor Moon is just as much about the fight against Queen Beryl as it is about Usagi and the other Sailor Scouts' personal lives.""]",2024-02-22T00:00:07Z,@enry2337

"What is hilarious is most of us could have told them this in the first place and saved them literally billions of dollars.  What level of arrogance does it take to ignore what is plainly in front of your eyes in order to blindly follow a dogma?  The fact that these people couldn't figure out what any Econ 101 student would have been able to tell you, ""The customer is always right!"" is just mind boggling.  Every single studio head and every single person involved in creating any of these catastrophes should be summarily fired and never allowed to work on a similar project ever again.  I mean, I'm a woman, and I was constantly saying, ""I don't care about or even like superhero movies...""  The only time I would ever go to one is if my husband wanted to see it, and then my enjoyment is mostly coming out of spending time with him and seeing him entertained, not particularly in much of what is going on with the movie.  Occasionally these movies would, when they were doing it right, toss some little things towards demographics that weren't really into it, like a little romance sub-story in the superhero movie, or some conflict in a romance flick.  But girl bosses?  Where is the romance in that?  They're as boring to me as watching an action flick.  More so even, since there isn't even anything on the screen for me to appreciate.  There are places for both genders of actors in all films, and some films can touch equally both genders.  But trying to take a genre that is mostly enjoyed by a single gender, and warp it into something that is not at all what that gender wants to see or even is insulting to them, is simply slapping your customer in the face as soon as they walk in the door.

"The only addition I'd make to this excellent analysis is that the very biggest, most successful films are often those you might place naturally in the ""male"" genre - LotR, Maverick, The Avengers etc. The reason for this is whilst these films appeal to men due to their strong male characters and male-centric themes, lots and lots of women ALSO love strong male leads and male themes like action and adventure. Far more than the proportion of men who enjoy romance or musicals, for example.

So if you're going to make a blockbuster movie, if you pander to the woke and neuter your male characters, you'll not only turn off your male audience, but also the sizeable number of women who also really, really like watching Tom Cruise or Chris Hemsworth being heroic, strong male characters. Plenty of women still want a hero, even if studio creatives have decided that's now heresy.","['❤❤❤❤❤', ""And on top of that, those sucessful movies/stories are just quality.

This insidious behaviour infects their hiring strategy. If you don't fit the gender, race, or role, you will be overlooked in favour of someone less talented.

Stop throwing 5-6 solo movies and TV shows in the same year, we're tired of it, the characters we love are gone/dead/sex swapped/race swapped/etc. As Michael Jordan once said, ""Stop it, get some help!""

"Placing women as the lead in action pictures, where they basically become men in their traits and ability to beat up far larger males, is just another social inversion the left is promoting wherein the oppressors, i.e., white males, are replaced by the victims, i.e. women and POC as they take their place at the top of the social hierarchy.  Its the equity part of DEI.  In other words, pay back time. I think most people realize there's something wrong with this agenda.  Women have many fine traits, including brains and cleverness, nurturing, and stamina.  There was a time when those traits were displayed in movies where the female lead would overcome men by outsmarting them or using their own attractiveness.  90 pound females didn't go around kicking the ass of 200 pound warriors because that only appeals to women who wish they were men or who enjoy seeing men humiliated.

"I believe there IS a bit of a chicken in the egg situation when it comes to appeal and preference of movie genres. My daughters are often interested in more than what girls their age would traditionally be likened to and it's nice to have options beyond various Disney Princesses and the like to expose them to, but sometimes, that's all there is - so what else are they supposed to go gravitate towards? I encourage studios to continue to take risks to broaden the appeal of their properties, but at their core they have to be well-written and well-structured stories with likeable characters, heroes and villains. The movies themselves are just bad. I didn't not like Star Trek: Discover because of Burnham's gender, I didn't like it because it was awful storytelling and execution with piss-poor payouts generated from overelaborate macguffin chasing. The pitfall I see a lot for a lot of recent unsuccessful movies and TV shows is that their effort seems to stop with ""Main Character - 'strong female'. Alright, job's done... Obviously, people will watch this for that reason alone, no need to put in any effort anywhere else"". If I can love to watch near invincible Stallone or Swasennagger mow through a bunch of bad guys, with the most basic of movie plots, but well executed structures and a likeable protagonist or settings/concepts, studios can take a premises like The Marvels and Madam Web and make them watchable and enjoyable to both men and women with just better writing and directing. It's like they looked at winning formulas from strong female leads/co-leads like 'Alien', 'Max Max: Fury Road' or even 'Edge of Tomorrow' and just decided ""the reason people like these movies so much is because of the genders involved.""",[],2024-02-21T23:37:44Z,@SweetSweetCandyBoyz

"I am one of the girls who likes action flicks. I loved Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I will admit, I was at first happy when I saw female characters who got to be more than an object for the men to rescue. (Hint, if any character can be replaced with a random object that is nearly inanimate, there's a problem.) The first girl bosses kinda worked because they were unusual, and that on its own could make them a bit interesting. After a few years though, the novelty wore off and these female characters had nothing unique about  them other than their sex so there was no staying power.
There are two things Hollywood doesn't understand about us girls who enjoy action story lines. 1. We enjoy story lines with male characters. While we enjoy a well written female character, we also enjoy the same for male characters. I remember typing out a list of characters I loved and realizing many were males.  2. We also understand that because of basic biology, women are weaker than men. This means a female character SHOULD struggle more to beat a male character. Giving her an easy victory makes it harder for us to relate to her because we know we wouldn't win easily. (Think about Sarah Conner in the original Terminator. She barely beat the Terminator.) It is also worth noting that people love weaker male characters like Luke Skywalker, who lost most of the fights he entered. (The difference between Luke and the damsel in distress of old is that Luke became much more competent as time went on, while most of the older female characters who were there to be rescued never really grew.)",[],2024-02-21T23:08:48Z,@rebelrider3361

They have been releasing a steady stream of high-quality content for quite some time, and the new shows coming out just get better and better. It won’t be long before more people start switching over to anime and manga; two mediums where you can find stories devoid of messaging that still showcase fantastic narratives, classic themes, good morals, and relatable characters.

"the ""because males are sexist"" narrative is getting quite old.
If you present a cure to cancer and the cure doesn't do anything except placebo. And wen we say ""the cure doesn't work, it's not a cure"". Does it help the creator of said ""cure"" to say ""You must be pro cancer!!""? - No,I'm anti cancer, you just provided something that doesn't do what you think it does.
That is what Hollywood sounds like. When you shoehorn a narrative and it doesn't work. it isn't the fact that it is a ""woman lead movie"" that cause it to fail. They want to blame it on sexism because it's easier than looking inward to the terrible writing and narrative created.

"Your argument is solid, however let me introduce you to the loud minority of the beyond stupid audience member. They can be any demographic, but there are two particular ones that stand out as having more than the rest, and these particular people scream the loudest on any internet forum they can reach>

This hypothetical-but-real person is one that has an IQ beneath not just the average, but beneath the retardation line. They are unable to understand concepts, conditionals, characters, and often they might even have trouble discerning fiction from reality, which if your 2-year old child fails to do it is grounds for alarm as it is a sure sign of the parents being related. These people are unable to identify with a movie character unless it is a tailor-made replica of themselves, sporting the same hairstyle, the same skin color, speaking in the same style and overall they can't see someone as them unless they look in a mirror. Equally, when they DO identify with a character, any flaw is seen not just as criticism, but as a straight insult and challenge that they react to with the only weapon they have, and often it is violence. These people need characters made FOR them, characters without flaw, characters without potential because they are already at some peak of perfection, characters that succeed in everything easily because they want to see themselves like that and anything else is grounds for not just sending death threats, but acting on them. You can't portray A character of a particular coloration as being dumb or many of the characters of that coloration will see the movie as an insult and start shooting up streets, you can't show a character of a particular gender as being weak or those of that gender will try and ""prove they are not weak"" often by damaging something. The good news is that unless some particular people point it out, you can stealthily insult such people as long as you do not portray one of them.

These are a solid reason why Holloywood has been like this, because such people exist, despite it being a greater mercy to take them behind a shed, because such people that see big productions WANT to be represented there else they feel like their absence is some insult or message that they will no longer exist, and you HAVE to represent them as the most put-together, mary sue characters that ever existed or they will not just scream online, but hurt people who honestly enjoy it. Years of having to cater to these short-bus passengers have irrevocably damaged movies as with such restrictions one cannot have a good story.

Contrast that with the Marvels, which I just watched, and barely made it through once. NONE of my family wanted to watch that with me. They really did fuck that one up hard. 

It wasn’t designed for me but I still was able to enjoy Barbie for what it was going for.

"I got a creative writing degree in college, and the problem was and remains to this day is that men are not interested in writing fiction...there's no money in fiction.  For everyone one of two fiction books that get published, there's probably thousands that get turned away.  However, in non-fiction there significantly better odds you can sell yourself as an essayist, a columnist, a travel writer, a reporter even, plus ghost writing is a profitable business as well.  Any good writer in college is immediately steered to writing non-fiction so they can make money and hopefully donate it back to the school.

Women don't want to write non-fiction, however as I said before it's really freakin hard to make a profitable book, so they end up getting independent television and movie writing roles.  So naturally you are getting more women in writing rooms and very little to zero men, you don't have ideas to bounce off of to check to see if they work, so they just write what they think is good and it's not good.

"This is an honest question because I generally agree with this video’s hypothesis but why was Buffy so popular? 

Buffy is a super-girl-boss, Xander is a male bimbo, her mentor Wesley isn’t much better - by the end Willow is super powerful along with characters like Faith. 

The other obvious example is Ripley, she is totally more bad ass than most of the other marines, tho it’s her character of strength rather than her physical strength that is her real superpower.

My favorite of all time for strong, female character. Mrs. Brisby from the Secret of Nimh. Yes, a cartoon mouse is my favorite all strong, female character. Her character and actions can be lifted from the fantastic setting and applied to other stories. Just for the record, Ripley from Alien and Aliens is a close second. Hell, they share a lot of the same characteristics. They both face a dangerous horror. For Ripley, it's an alien. For Mrs Brisby, it's a tractor. The tractor is an overwhelming force for the tiny field mouse and shrew. Anyone who says they're not afraid of farm equipment has never seen someone mauled by farm equipment.

"I largely agree with the points you made in this video. One major point I disagree with is ""there has not been nor will there ever be a big female audience for superhero movies."" Your supporting arguments are strong. I agree that making girlboss movies where unrelatable female characters kick butt with no consequences while their male character counterparts solely exist to be the butt of jokes is not appealing to any audience--male or female. But to go as far as to say that we should never try to appeal to a female audience/give up changing the demographics of audiences that watch superhero movies is taking it too far. I believe that there is a world where incredible female-lead superhero movies can be a huge hit among male and female audiences. They just need to make movies that have characters that audiences can relate to/want to root for. 

There have been very crappy male-lead superhero movies. We don't say that we should not make anymore male-lead superhero movies just because those crappy movies exist. Instead, we point out the flaws that made those movies crappy and encourage better movies to be made. The same concept applies for female-lead superhero movies.","['This comment deserves more likes', ""I agree. What we need is plausible human beings displayed on film.

"I actually disagree with some points here. I think they were actually starting to woo women with the early Marvel movies. How did they do it? Was it with all the empowered women? Nope. 

I knew SO MANY women who were OBSESSED with the sexy male lineup of the original MCU. I actually heard girls raving avout MCU more than boys in my teen social circle, often arguing about who was the hottest of the lineup. Making the male heroes more sexy and personable was actually seemingly reeling in more women to watch, while maintaining guys as well. Then they replaced all the guys with stoney faced, perfect power fantasy girls and the women and men tuned out. 

I don't think you'll ever reel women into hardcore sci-fi or extremely complex super hero universes, but you could easily score a larger female audience while maintaining male audiences by making men sexy, manly, and dangerous again. I mean the amount of fan girling over the MCU was ridiculous. They had their female audience and male audience, but decided to pretend women don't want to see attractive charismatic men anymore. 

If there had been a real Black Widow movie that was done as a grounded spy thriller and featured some past male spy who was attractive and dangerous having a back and forth cat and mouse game I guarantee they could've reeled in loads of women and men. 

MCU was successfully appealing to women in the past by casting a lot of actors that women found extremely attractive. If casting Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. strange wasn't a move to attract women I don't know what is. It was actually the first time I ever saw women starting to get excited for super hero stuff, and then they tossed it all away.

"Sometimes movies are supposed to make us uncomfortable. Barbie was designed for a female audience sure. But It was also designed to make men uncomfortable with the status quo. It was done in a tasteful and successful way in that we're supposed to laugh at the absurdity of both Ken and Barbie. I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think Barbie was a great movie. I went into it thinking i'd hate it for all the reasons you've mentioned before, and for the first half I agreed. However, that changed when i realized what the move was actually trying to do for their audience. 
As for girl bosses. They don't need to die. They certainly don't need to be in every movie either. What they need is an understanding of the strengths that women bring to the table. It's not fighting and dominating 260 pound weight lifting MMA men with super strength. I agree that they need to use the gifts they have to solve a problem, but more importantly, they need to make the audience care about them as characters. They need a backstory, they need challenges to overcome, not by kicking ass, but by using their gifts in a realistic way. They don't need to insult every man in the film, additionally, every man in the film doesn't need to be portrayed as a bumbling fool that needs saving from an overly masculated female character.

Before iron man most super hero movies were unsuccessful. It took studios about 30 years to figure out action and super hero movies. It looks like they thought if we change a couple of things we can grow our audience in this new demographic. Which led to a budget misalignment for some movies. Also audiences were expecting movie Type A when they got Movie type B so were disappointed because expectations were not met. I think female super hero movies can be successful but it requires appropriate budgets audience expectations to expand so they understand they are getting type B or type A and film makers figuring out how to make Type B work.,[],2024-02-21T21:02:49Z,@bevynq

The gender of the main character(s) matters little to me, it's why I didn't cry foul when GTA V had three male leads, or when RWBY had four female ones. It's all about whether or not the characters are portrayed as realistic, likeable, engaged, genuine, and not pointlessly 'at war' with the other sex.

And this applies to villainous characters as well.

"... ""The problem with Hollywood""...

WAY back in 1998 Warren Beatty made a fun movie called Bullworth that sums up amazingly well the current state then - and now - of Hollywood - see if you don't agree.

The movie is about a U. S. Senator from California - played by Warren Beatty, who has had a ""Come to Jesus"" moment, so to speak, and is telling the truth without holding anything back (for the first time in his 30-year political life).

The story-line gets a little uneven and odd at times but, let's face it, there are few ""perfect"" movies - and the truly funny, insightful good moments in this one outweigh the minor bad ones.

In any event, Warren Beatty plays the Senator and delivers the following line in the scene at the big Hollywood fundraiser, where he is speaking to ...""all the rich Jews"",

"I'll post what I posted on another video here: ""The elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about are the biological differences between the two sexes. We can deny it till we're blue in the face - while men and women are equal legally and socially, we're NOT the same biologically and psychologically. Men overwhelmingly gravitate towards portrayals of violence while women overwhelmingly gravitate towards portrayals of love and romance. All the modern attempts to reverse, deconstruct and remake this phenomenon will NOT change millions of years of evolution. The only way to change this is to recode the programming in our genes. This is why the writers and publishers of romance novels are so successful, they know EXACTLY what women want and they dutifully stick to the formula - boy meets girl, boy loses girl on page 56, and by page 180 the book ends with a marriage proposal. You can call it old-fashioned, sexistic, homophobic and all the other modern tropes - evolutionary biology doesn't give a damn. Fact is, this is what is hard-wired into women's DNA and so therefore this is what women respond to. See exhibit A - the very strong sales figures for romance novels, no matter how ridiculous or contrived the plotline. You can't FORCE women to like violent superhero stories. Sure, there'll always be that sizable crowd that likes violent video games and go see all the violent movies, etc., but they represent the clear minority and not the majority of women. Men, especially testosterone filled YOUNG men, are the main purveyors and consumers of violence - you create violent superhero films and market them to women at your own financial risk!""",[],2024-02-21T20:48:15Z,@CurtisCT
"3:18 notice how men aren't even remotely interested in the things that women like? Whereas all the things that men enjoy women can also kind of get into. This isn't because women have broader tastes than men, this is because 'male' entertainment has been diluted to cater to women. It's rare that you'll see male entertainment which doesn't try to lure in women, either by catering to their egos or by introducing a romantic subplot. Whereas, romances don't even bother to try to lure in men.

I myself have numerous anthropomorphic OCs that I've created over the years - most were male to start with, so I started including females to balance it up a bit.

"As a woman who prefers sci-fi and superheroes over romance, I'm in the 30%, but that's OK 😉 But, I will also say, as a woman, that I agree. These aren't the films I want to see. The characters are boring at best, obnoxious at worst. I don't care if characters are male/female, or 'strong', I care if they're interesting. The only 2 films I've paid to see in recent years were Dune, and Oppenheimer, both excellent. 

I will offer an example, as a contrast, of a good female lead (at least from my female perspective): Katniss Everdeen (and maybe it helps that she comes from books, not directly from Hollywood). Yes, there's a strong core to her character, but mostly she's just fighting for survival, and the survival of her sister (her core motivation). She's terrified, and (realistically) has massive PTSD. She doesn't magically become awesome at everything, she's often on the edge of failure, and absolutely needs the support of the people around her. She's a complex character, with many flaws, a complex back story, and clear, strong motivations.

After a while they get over it and go with lots of hugging and girly noises, again showing some teenage like behavior, that makes it harder to take them seriously. I just don't get it.

The inherent message of the superhero genre is 'you should become a hero through righteous violence' with the unspoken corollary being 'enlist in the military.' And the services are desperately scrambling to recruit more females. Hollywood depends on DOD cooperation to make these movies and the amount of control the Pentagon has over scripts now is alarming.

"I don't believe in pure pandering. There's no reason why a movie targeted to women can't also attract men, and vice versa. As a man, I did not enjoy BARBIE much, but I did identify with Ken, and ultimately felt empowered by his story arc. The main message of BARBIE is that it's dangerous to keep an entire group of people in perpetual oppression, because then they will revolt and seize power, and be too ignorant to know how to exercise that power. The Barbies learn that the Kens needed to be fully incorporated into their society, or else Barbieland would be subject to an endless cycle of coups d'etat. But, in a way, it was ironic that conservatives were so offended by BARBIE, because the movie's ideology was itself conservative: proceed slowly with civil rights reform, educating minorities before you allow them to take the reins of power.

"As a child in the 1970s, I loved the Disney princess movies (some more than others), Mighty Mouse was my favorite TV cartoon. It was love at first sight when my parents took us to Star Wars Episode 4. My sister and I would catch reruns of Star Trek: TOS when we could find it. 

Later, I watched Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. 

My favorite Disney movie is the animated Beauty and the Beast. I've watched the Fifth Element at least 100 times. I enjoyed both the Adventures of Hercules and Xena, but enjoy Xena more because the character development seems deeper and more complex.

 But I also watch A&E's 1995 Pride and Prejudice at least once per year, although, I generally dislike romance movies and rom coms . 

Suffice to say, I've watched my share of content that features strong women. I've also watched my share of content that wouldn't fit the image of women currently pushed by Hollywood. 

But the mere presence of ""girl boss power"" isn't why I watch.  

Give me a compelling story with characters that seem like humans. 

Who struggle and work with other characters. 

One of my favorite genres is mystery series. I'll watch any series in that genre regardless of the sex, race, identity of the sleuth as long as the stories are logical and the characters are interesting.

In the liberal utopia, boys cannot grow up looking up to traditionally masculine ideals, and men may occupy two vocations: a meek sexless worker drone or a male model boytoy. (Trans agenda serves the same purpose - it creates literal castrated male worker drones).\

"I read a quote from an unnamed Disney exec the other day that said ""More and more, our audience (or the segment of the audience that has been politicized) equates the perceived messaging in a film as a quality issue. They won’t say they find female empowerment distasteful in The Marvels or Star Wars, but they will say they don’t like those movies because they are ‘bad.’ So ‘make better movies’ becomes code for ‘make movies that conform to regressive gender stereotypes or put men front and center in the narrative.’ Which is what you’re seeing now."" Source: Puck News via Darkhorizons. 
In other words, it's STILL the fault of evil bigots (ie. everyday regular people who just want to be entertained) that none of Hollywood's lazily written attempts to crowbar female empowerment into male brands isn't working. The wonderful and virtuous writing teams aren't to blame, it's the bigoted audience who simply hate women and speak in code. Definitely not because these movies are dismally written, cynical, social-trend-of-the-month chasing, browbeating, pandering, deliberately combative and divisive.

"One also need to understand why the women that DO loyally follow genres such as fantasy & sci-fi & action & other typical male genres is because these women have found the appeal of said genres just as men do. And if there is anything in typical male genres that does appeal to the minor but just as loyal female audience it is very often the male characters! A woman myself I grew up with SW, Indiana Jones, Rambo, Alien, Terminator, Back to the Future & much more. Of course I loved Princess Leia, Ripley & Sarah Connor, & later on even became a large Lara Croft fan. But my true desire was Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Rambo, Kyle Reese, & later on Jack Sparrow, Aragorn, Maximus, Nathan Algren etc etc. What woke Hollywood refuses to understand is that the vast majority of women on this planet happens to be hetero & hetero women love to see attractive male actors doing awesome stuff, no matter if they are heroes or villains, in whatever fav stories they put to film. There is an old classic saying about the James Bond fandom; the male audience fantasize about being Bond himself. The female audience dreams about having sex with Bond. That explains it all really. Clark Gable had a very dedicated female fan base back in his days! So have Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Richard Burton. Who were screaming the highest at Beatles & Elvis concerts? Face it, Hollywood; women LOVE men! Actual men that we have no problem relating to even if our genders are opposite. Sorry, KK, but you are a moron for claiming that women are literary unable to identify with male characters, such as Han & Luke for example. No, woman, YOU have that problem! You do not speak for me or for the female half of this planet with your, honestly, very sexist opinions targeting women as much as men. Women actually love male characters that have meaning to the story they are in, even if the role itself might be tiny. Most men are genetically programmed by Mother Nature to find the hottest chick, or chicks, he can find so he can have the greatest sex with her & spawn as much as possible. Women look for the strongest & most protective man, preferably good looking but not a demand, so she can feel safe & race her kids in harmony & safety. This is how we are & function genetically as well as emotionally. With exceptions, of course, that should never be ignored or disrespected. But if you wanna tell stories as a way to make a living, stop going against Mother Nature. Stop undoing what we have known about each other & story telling since the camp fires back in the stone age. The ancient Greeks invented drama & theater because they understood the importance of story telling to strengthen your culture, people & nation. Stories unify - if told right.

Abolished - all religious and metaphysics is rejected. Engels and Lenin agreed that religion was a drug or “spiritual booze” and must be combated. To them, atheism put into practice meant a “forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.”

You had ten great years of movies that built up to an epic climax but since then it’s as if Marvel is trying to 180 it self and undo its own success. It’s been five years since Endgame and there have been very few noteworthy titles under the Marvel name to garner any positive attention from the fans. And it has to be on purpose. You don’t take a franchise brand like Marvel and fuck it up on accident like this to the point everyone is wanting their money back for a MARVEL movie. Even pre-MCU movies didn’t have this kind of backlash, I mean the Fabtastic Four movies from the 2000s aren’t generally loved but they do have their fans and I’ve yet to hear anyone regret paying to see them. 

The big question is what is the endgame in all this? Turn back the clock years ago and nobody would have questioned who was better between Marvel and DC as far as longevity but in the last few years we continue to see this spiral of failure from a once revered name in the business and you have to wonder what the hell they are smoking to fuck things up this badly.",[],2024-02-21T20:03:38Z,@robertdurant-jl8bf
"First, you are correct. Second, let's be honest about the world. The writers for Hollywood come from the liberal arts schools that are extremely political now. It is embarrassing that phrases such as ""know your audience"", ""Create believable characters"", and ""Your protagonist is only as good as your antagonist"" have been forgotten. These are things we were literally taught in high school English or in English 111 in college. Call it ""The Message"", ""Going Woke"" or whatever, at the end of the day it is the death of common sense that has killed Hollywood. Great stories and storytelling have been around as long as the history of mankind, or humankind for you sensitive types. The fact that Hollywood can't seem to tell original, compelling stories says a LOT about our university and ""ivy league"" college system. Honestly, the studios would probably have better luck with writers from the local community college.",[],2024-02-21T20:03:32Z,@BerserkPublishing

"Hollywood, the souless bank accounts, nor the 'creative' writing staff comprehend that what people want to see is all the values and traits that they admire or share with a protagonist. Nobody likes the bland and boring Mary Sue the same way nobody likes Gary Stus either, it isn't the gender it's the relatability. The reason nobody connects with Rey is because she's automatically good at everything and succeeds on the first or second try each time, she's just naturally gifted but in -everything- she attempts. You could have made it a male character and everyone would have been just as annoying.

Pepperidge Farm remembers when Jake Lloyd got bullied off the web and ostracized by the whole Star Wars fandom for playing a character that was annoyingly talented, naturally good at everything, and had to put in zero effort. What's worse was that it fit Anakin's character perfectly, just like it fits all these talentless ESG/DEI hires. They've had everything handed to them, have to work for nothing, and then get upset when the real world knocks them off the pedestal that some corporation or ideology put them on. Really, it isn't their fault. They're born, raised, educated and employed in a perfect little bubble, so of course when that protective layer is gone they see the world as hostile and hateful. The people victimized by this cycle don't deserve any of the hate, and from what I've seen they don't get much unless they try and defend that position.

See the difference between Daisy Ridley and Rachel Zegler. One took the criticism in stride and acted like a professional, the other took up the shield of 'diversity' and 'change' and used it to avoid any and all criticisms about their work. Hatred for the art is not the same as hatred for the artist, and until the system stops trying to remain an echo chamber it will only get worse.",[],2024-02-21T20:02:26Z,@Varyn_TV

"The problem is that ""badass girl bosses"" are more appealing to a very specific group then actual heroic female characters, mainly because they don't understand what it means to be heroic, and much less what it means to perform heroic acts (and the personal costs such acts may carry for the hero or heroine who might accept such costs initially or learn to accept them as part of the responsibility they carry as superheroes and superheroines over time). That is why they go ""wow"" when they see a female character punching holes in a spaceship, but doesn't give a rat's ass that the character is ACTUALLY committing mass murder as a result, because to them the optics means more than the meaning or outcome of the act. To them, being ""badass"" means more than ACTUALLY doing good in the world of the superheroes and superheroines (and being the role models they so desperately want them to be), in whatever form that may take according to their individual or personal contributions or skill sets of such a character. 

To deny them their ""due praise"" as girl bosses, is to deny those group their ""fullest potential"" and as a result of that, they believe a rejection of such characters are a rejection of their ""fullest potential"" as women (who can in their eyes do EVERYTHING better than men can, which is part of the problem which leads to such female characters keep on failing). An interesting lack of self awareness (or perhaps even a deliberate avoidance of the more obvious reason) of WHY those characters aren't accepted, which I can illustrate with a much earlier Marvel character and scenario. In the first Thor movie, we see a boisterous, arrogant and childish Thor living the high life, and who has to be HUMBLED to reach his fullest potential as a hero by ditching everything that was sabotaging him on his journey in becoming a worthy champion of Asgard - in essence, becoming WORTHY of his mantle as a hero (as framed by being able to lift his hammer again), which is why Captain America at first struggles doing so, but once he embraces the selflessness and sacrifice that going all out in helping those that need it, he is able to lift the hammer as well. Vision could lift the hammer right after being ""born"", because it was in his nature (as part Jarvis, but also part Ultron - illustrating his capacity to be either good OR evil, and choosing to be good OVER evil) to already serve those that needed help because of his unique abilities that allowed him to better understand everyone and use those insights to help them. The lifting of Thor's hammer isn't some ""PRIZE"" to be taken, it's a measure by which a hero or heroine can judge their OWN motivations for their actions and thoughts, and gives us, the audience, a look into WHEN a hero or heroine has TRULY reached that threshold of fully accepting their role as a protector and guardian of Earth (and the bigger universe as a hole). That is why letting EVERYONE just lift it for no reason at all proves absolutely nothing and is a huge let down, because we KNOW some of the other characters haven't gone through the fires of temptation or suffered as a result of being a superhero or superheroine, and gained no wisdom from such experiences that shape and form them into the heroes or heroines that one could root for and which would making the lifting of the hammer meaningful in any way.  

A more interesting angle I'd like to point out is the following. They never show the female characters being part of the ""brainstorming of solutions"" or helping the male characters constructing anything (something that really stood out in the DC ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" animated movie of 2024, when an emergency facilitated an ""all-hands onboard"" effort by dozens of characters trying to stop a multiverse ending event (which BTW also highlighted the ACTUAL diversity of characters over the decades as well, I might add - with zero gender or race swaps necessary). As the Flash's dying wife told him, ""you were late for all OUR appointments, but you were always on time when it mattered"" (or something to that effect) - the kind of understanding of heroic characters by a storyteller who TOTALLY gets it.  

So the ""death of the girl bosses""? Doubtful. They had them to a lesser degree BEFORE I was born several decades ago, and they will KEEP ON pushing them until they are accepted (even if only by a fraction of a small audience, and even in ways you don't even realize in your favorite characters or franchises). And I'm also pretty sure once those characters are accepted, they will make them even MORE unlikeable then they already are, and those characters will CONTINUE to be ""promoted"" in every franchise imaginable with cries of ""go queen, slay"" for YEARS to come, because their supporters and defenders are EVERYWHERE in current day, even when that's not even the majority of the audience.",[],2024-02-21T19:52:51Z,@sigmacademy
In my opinion women are fairly drawn to masculine spaces and culture so long as there are at least a few crumbs for them like a romance subplot or a female character that reasonably facilitates projection.  There is no need whatsoever to go ham with full replacement of male characters and lefty girl power messaging in male franchises to get a ton of women in with their boyfriends.  Meanwhile you’re just not going to get men to go see the likes of Barbie or Lesbians Riding Bicycles.  So in the end the highest potential is going to be male focused media as Hollywood once understood.,[],2024-02-21T19:52:40Z,@jmass4207

She survives at last because of the sacrifice and risk taking of the other crew members, granting her the opportunity to learn and adapt.

"I can't get this thought out of my head about how badly modern Hollywood has screwed all this up. Great female action heroes aren't some great mystery that's yet to be figured out, we had this shit right as far back as '77 - Princess Leia is a first rate action hero, and I will die on that hill. In a few more years we also got gems like Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor... and the thought I can't get out of my head is this: Modern Hollywood writers would have had Sarah go through with killing Miles Dyson. They probably view her stopping herself in that moment as some kind of weakness or flaw that modern girlbosses just aren't allowed to have... even if that's what makes the characters human and relatable.
Also, modern writers probably wouldn't even have Arnold in T2 at all, because Sarah ""don't need no man""... or some crap. Also, John might not be in it, either, because we want our girls to grow up to aspire to things other than motherhood or love... So, no motherhood, no love stories... so that's Terminator and Terminator 2 out the window... also Aliens, since that gives Ripley strong themes of motherhood with Newt. But, y'know, those movies are obviously massive flops and forgotten pieces of crap that no on ever talks about, or ever speaks of as possibly the best sci-fi films ever made, or action films ever made, full stop. Oh... Wait...","['even as far back as Maria from *Metropolis (1927).*  She may not have been an ""action hero"", but she was the one to convince the rich and the poor to shake hands and amend their fears/hates of each other, which led to the almost total destruction of their society as manipulated by technology posing as a hedonistic human.  Hmm.. if only that message pertained to modern society in some way...', 'Perfectly stated! I have watched all of the movies you mentioned recently because I wanted to be reminded of how well movies can be made.', 'I have been saying this, arguing this very point of yours online since about 2005. Applied it to Doctor Who, Trek, Star Wars, Terminator and so on. I used to write for Den of Geek a fan site. And in the end I stopped writing articles for them. Why? The constant uphill battle to get the people to see that stuff like Ghostbusters 2016 was a bad idea, for the exact reasons you mention above. I got so sick of trying to get my point across, to just be shouted down as a racist a misogynist, a bigot or for being too critical. I got tired of being told I was wrong about Rey, about Captain Marvel and everything inbetween.  So I stopped writing for them, I stopped creative writing and more or less gave up. There was little point as no one would listen. And then we had last year and its flopbusters. And I started to see the tide was turning. At last. I dont for one second think Hollywood will learn its lesson. I think that certain studios will go bust trying to prove this point, and things like Star Wars will never change back to the good they were. BUT the general audience has had enough. They are rejecting it and so that at least gives me some hope.

A surefire sign of a threatened, insecure man who carries in his heart a burning hatred against women, is in the language he uses.  If his language is tinged with violence and an air of mortal threat, that's a surefire sign of a woman hater.  For instance, let's say he puts out an internet video, with a title along the lines of ""Death of the girl boss"" He could have just as easily titled it ""End of the girl boss"" or ""Society rejects the girl boss"" But that's not where his head truly is.  The reality is that deep down, he's profoundly threatened by the prospect of equality.  He doesn't believe women or any other group that threatens him deserves anything beyond a role of total subservience.  Therefore, any perceived threat will be viewed through a lens of extreme devaluation and eradication.

"You know what? I'm actually going to disagree with you. You CAN cater to both audiences and your idea for Top Gun Marverchick could have actually worked. What you described is literally TOO GOOD for Hollywood. The PROBLEM isn't just that they're taking stuff that appeals to women and shoving them into male brands, it's the fact that as they do that they try and make the male brands aggressively anti-men! The Hollywood version of your Top Gun Maverchick would have starred the woman, and she would have acted like a guy except even more of a jerk, and every man would have been an incompetent irredeemable monster. I bring this up because there are many projects out there that understand the concept of a Periphery Demographic...but that's the key word: PERIPHERY. You always have one MAIN demographic that you cater to mostly, and then a secondary demographic you throw some bones to.

Anime understood this a lot. Much of the magical girl genre is aimed at little girls but still throws in some stuff to appeal to a male fanbase like leaning into darker plots at times, making the girls a smidge more attractive and not just cute, and recently punching up the fights a bit. This stemmed a lot from how Cutey Honey went down back in the 70s: a female led manga which featured wall to wall tiddies yet inexplicably appealed to girl got made into an anime aimed at girls that easily appealed to boys with its action scenes and more risque moments.

For something closer to home? My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. You think that show INTENDED to be a smash hit with 30 year old men?! No. But it did because they tried to make the show tolerable for parents and eventually threw their new unexpected fandom plenty of bones with some unexpected deeper lore moments. Though really I liked it because it was better at being a modern Looney Tunes than the actual Looney Tunes show. Dropping a piano on a wheelchair bound Twilight Sparkle is, in fact, the moment I fell in love with the show.

So you absolutely COULD make a show/movie that appeals to both men AND women BUT it requires you to:
1) Not hate half your audience
2) Acknowledge that Men and Women are different

So...basically impossible for modern Hollywood.",[],2024-02-21T19:41:51Z,@GELTONZ

"My thing is the point of “a woman doesn’t primarily want to see guns and action scenes they’d rather something like Barbie” isn’t inherently correct. While yes the themes of Barbie spoke to me — as a woman — I’m not entirely a lover of those types of movies. I prefer the deeply cerebral, violent, and pay-off type movies that men mostly get advertised to. 

An example of a show specifically catered to women but falls in line with a lot of what I said is The Handmaid’s Tale. It unnerves you, it makes you think, it can be deeply violent, and has a main character that is believable and extremely well written. I’ve never seen anything in media portray actual female rage and suffering as well as that show. 

Another example is Alien: the main character isn’t written with the idea of feminine aspects in mind, but she’s extremely believable to me. As a woman I relate to her, and the way she’s badass without screaming “GIRL POWER” at the damn xenomorph makes her one of the few women in media I adore. Ellen is a great example of how not thinking about gender and just creating a character works! Alien is consumable by every gender and I’ve never seen anyone complain about Ellen being a woman. 

My point is just make a show, a book, a movie, or whatever and stop thinking about how you have to cater to someone or the character has to be overly masculine or feminine. Write a damn character and give them a gender afterwards unless you specifically want to make a point about it. 

I’m tired of seeing people miss the point of getting the female audiences attention. It isn’t hard you just won’t make a character that doesn’t talk about her FEMALE PROBLEMS every two damn seconds. I’m not saying women don’t discuss it, but they sure as hell don’t do it every waking moment. My entire life isn’t devoted to proving I’m more capable than the men or whatnot, even if that’s something I’ve legitimately went through. People have an idea on how you should be, and by acknowledging it and moving on that’s more girl power than any of these movies understand. Being able to withstand the comments, the mental strain, and the inadequacy you feel everywhere you go is the female experience, but it can also be relatable to MEN!!! We might feel inadequacy in different ways, but it still stems from our social circles. Don’t put the other gender down in media. Lift, appreciate, and create solely for the concept of creativity itself.",[],2024-02-21T19:41:32Z,@Chicken_Tendies

It's like the writers go into the writing room with the following philosophy:
Men are bad and Society was created by men therefore Society is bad. Yet women are good no matter what status they have in life. Unless they act like women have traditionally acted then they're bad. They can only act like men but remember men are bad. Even when men start acting like women to counteract the women acting like men.

"What I would like to see is the story of a female superhero that has to be reigned in by her male counterparts. In case you haven’t noticed, females tend to go scorched-earth if you wrong them, they have almost no capability for forgiveness. This manifests mostly as a war of character assassination and manipulation waged non-stop until one side capitulates, or everyone has chosen a winner. Now what if that woman had the powers of Wonder Woman or Cpt Marvel? She would have no limitations and could shift it to a physical war. The one that wronged her would be eliminated and so would her friends and family. Why not? Who’s gonna stop her? If you want a taste of this, go watch _’’My Super Ex-Girlfriend’’_ and ask yourself how frequently that would happen with female supers.
         The real problem is that they aren’t just telling the story of a woman discovering her own strengths, values, and beliefs and putting them to use, which could be (and has been) done right alongside male characters.
          Instead, they tell the story of a woman (not to be confused with female human) that doesn't really behave like a woman discovering that she is incredible because she is a woman. There is no risk and payoff for the woman character. There is no gratification for achieving something amazing because she was always able to do it. She doesn’t earn anything, and she doesn’t change.  Instead of a story about how great she can become, you get a story about her forcing everyone else to agree that she is great, always has been, and they were wrong all along.

"Action/Superhero movies, like sports, are an analog of war. People that go to Superhero/Action movies want to see someone overcoming serious challenges with calamitous consequences, either using skills and abilities that they have earned the hard way (like soldiers, Batman, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, etc.) or using a God given talent (mutants, divine gifts, etc.). They want to leave with the hope that they can be like those people and that they can overcome their own conflicts, and those imposed upon them by others, to protect and provide for their own. Those stories are purpose built to satisfy masculine instincts.
         Contrast that with romances/musicals/dances/dramas that are (mainly) about teamwork and interpersonal relationships. There seem to be about 3 main types. They want to see a woman that comes know herself and wrestles with her perceived flaws successfully, then go out and be a successful woman with a fine man in a supportive, caring community, that looks to her for advice and leadership. They may just want to see the woman character getting the good, dependable, alpha male that will take care of, protect, and provide for her for life. Or they will want to see the woman overcome the different personalities, available resources, and environmental conditions, to create a solid, effective, cohesive group that can care for and nurture each other and their charges (children, community). Again, stories purpose-built for feminine instincts.
          Instincts that are defined by your chromosomes before birth and that 95% of humans have. In point of fact, you have to be born mentally defective –by definition– to not have those instincts.

"If any further proof is needed of what was said in the video, you need look no further than the 2024 box office  no.1 and no.2:
No.1 : The Beekeeper - 143 million : A Jason Statham action flick where we get to see the man be a badass and deliver explosive action and good hand to hand combat scenes in spades unlike in The trench 2 or the Expendables 4 (because not like Tony Jaa or Iko Uwais would have given any potential for a few good brawls and not like the precedent was not set in the 2nd movie in the franchise with Scott Adkins and JCVD as villains who fight hand to hand too against Jason and Sly respectively). 

No.2 : Mean Girls - 101 million Rom com musical

2 movies with a clear target audience that give the said audience what they want.

Disney, sony, marvel, amazon etc are multi billion dollar companies who will always have plenty of money, so the producers just need to present an idea of appealing to a demographic that seems like an unttaped groupe free for the taking and in the meanwhile is just non existent. In paper it sounds good, so the investors just willingly throw money away into whatever project comes up and the producers and whatever party involved in their plan pockets the money.

This might be another good reason why movies nowadays cost way more and everything is way worse, first thing that comes to mind is the terrible cgi despite of the budget being over billions of dollar.

"Dear Critical Drinker,

This is the first video of yours that I felt compelled to respond to. I agree with the premise of this video, but I feel like you got sidetracked from the real problem. The failure of the film industry isn’t because studios are trying to cater to new audiences, it’s because they’re making garbage. 

In your examples, you used Maverick to point out how male centric movies couldn’t appeal to women and asked if we wanted to see a movie about a female pilot who struggles to balance her work with her home life, romantic life, and more. Actually, yes, I’d love to see that movie. If it was made well.

The reason why these movies are failing isn’t because they try to appeal to everyone, it’s that they do so in a clumsy, stupid way. The first two Alien and Terminator movies show a strong female character in masculine movies that appeal to everyone. The reason why these movies are so successful is because they are done well. We still remember and watch them decades later because they are that good.

Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, and other recent Disney films don’t appeal to anyone because they are poorly written, poorly cast, poorly acted, poorly directed, and just end up being shitty movies that no one remembers a couple of months after they release in theaters. It isn’t because of gender, it’s a matter of quality.",[],2024-02-21T19:34:11Z,@TonyWright-c6h

"Whenever this topic comes up, I always think of Bill Burr's bit on the WNBA.  He rightfully blames women for the failure of the WNBA.  Why is the responsibility of men to watch the WNBA?  Women got what they wanted (or thought they wanted) with their own league, so why aren't they watching it?  Because they are busying watching a lot of things (like the Kardashians) that they really like but don't necessarily want to own up to liking.

Same thing applies to these movies.  The claim is that women want to see themselves in these movies.  They want to be the action hero lead.  They want to be the strong superhero character.  Great, then here are many movies in a row meeting that exact request.  Then all these movies flopped.  Don't blame men.  These are movies tailored for women at (supposedly) the request of women.  So where is the female audience?  Why aren't females supporting other females in these movies?

Out of the top ten highest grossing movies one is a def primary female driven movie at titanic which even that's a little debatable because men love disaster movies. Beyond that all of them are men primary movies. 

When you cater to the audience you should you see massive success. Look at Barbie a female audience movie has 1.4 BILLION dollars, beauty and the beast 1.2 billion, cap marvel 1.1 (that was at the early stages of girlbosses though so people gave it a chance) after that you get twilight who almost made a billion.

Despite this she perseveres and at one point when Sergeant  Foley is attempting to get Richard Gere’s  “Mayo“ to quit, Foley points out Seeger, working on her upper body strength to try to get over the wall, and he tells Mayo that she might not make it but she has more heart than he’ll ever have.  She eventually gets over the wall as Mayo encourages her, not because she has to have a man’s help but because Mayo sees her as an equal, if one makes it we all make it.

I wanted to know what Madame Web's actual box office was after the refunds. Obviously they weren't enough to make a dent in the box office, but what if we make sure they do next time? There was nothing false or misleading about Madame Web's box office, because the theaters and ticket sellers simply stated their takings. They couldn't have known people would want a refund. Moving forward, can we use refunds as a new metric to judge a movie's performance at the box office? Wouldn't the threat of mass refunds force the studios to make movies people don't want a refund for? How humiliating would it be for a studio if one million people cancelled and got a refund for their movie? A ten minute youtube video that sucks is ten minutes of your life you'll never get back. A ten minute video from you, telling us not to watch a movie, saves us two hours of life wasted. There's nothing illegal about what i'm suggesting. We are all free to buy a movie ticket and then cancel it to get a refund, if we think the movie will not be what we expect. That's where you come in. There is no way for the studios to combat this. They can review embargo until the eleventh hour, but no-one will go to the movie until you greenlight it. By then, if it's bad, everyone will already know it's bad and tell the whole world it's bad. Is this a new era of tactical refunds?",[],2024-02-21T19:21:46Z,@voice552

I recently watched a light fluff action movie 'Ghosted' on Apple which thankfully had an enjoyable female lead, who yes was OTT 'kick ass' but still had femininity and worked with her male co-star not totally against him or belittled him at every opportunity.

"Alright I've heard this from multiple YouTubers that girls don't like action or superheroes. It's not that we don't like action or superhero movies. All the woman I know will sit down and watch a good action. We love the strong tough guy coming in, having to learn and grow  to be able to kick ass, and save the day. We just don't like this she boss crap. It's boring to watch a movie where the girl is never wrong, knows everything, and can beat anyone. They make all the men either washed up or stupid and weak, then the girl has to save him. For the women who love having real masculine men in their lives, we don't want to have to save and protect them that's not our role. So we can't relate to this trash or believe it. I'd rather see a woman like Sarah Conner she was tough and strong but couldn't do it all.

"A flawless, overpowered character who solos through an action adventure could still theoretically work and draw in a large audience if it has two main ingredients, because the main thing mary sues lack isn't weakness or good teammates, but charm and charisma. Characters like 007 or Superman could still garner a lot of fans because of traits like James Bond being suave, smooth and charming and Clark Kent being an earnest, good hearted, all American farm boy, despite the fact that they do fit the gary stu mold. 
The problem is that if you're a girlboss, you are legally obligated to have the worst personality traits of all time, a loveless, sexless, joyless, narcissistic, misogynistic, misandrist show-off who only cares about gaining power and fighting le patriarchy. I can guarantee you that a lot of people would have been on board with characters like Rey or Captain Marvel if the marketing around them wasn't so garbage and if they had some charisma. Rey could have had an infectious, excited fangirl energy and a lot of ""scrappy underdog from a backwater planet, rising against the odds"" appeal but they wasted that potential.

"This is not foolishness. Most of the writers may be mentally- and emotionally-stunted imbeciles who simply want to see themselves self-inserted onto the big screen, but the people who do the hiring and sign the checks - the suits at the top - are not simply out-of-touch goons who think this will sell: they've had far too many years to see that it doesn't, and have seen that it doesn't sell in comics and TV before movies and games. This is still a focus on social engineering. These people's progenitors infiltrated the west from the Soviet bloc circa 1924. They're fine with playing the long game. They'll just tone back the indoctrination and get back to work eroding our collective morality, cooperating with their cousins in academia to further unmoor us from our history and any old tales that could teach universal morals.
Some of them genuinely believe this is for the greater good, that they need to destroy all existing morality and norms to properly train us into being drones in their communist utopia.

"I find most super hero movies boring and unrealistic. Obviously, the ""super"" part has to be swallowed while also expecting that person to otherwise act like a normal human being.

Today's guys have spent their childhoods and teen years playing video games and imagining what they'd do if they had some kind of super power. 

I don't know what the ladies have done other than tea parties, dolls, Barbies, makeup and imagining the eventual wedding they keep putting off until after college and after they've established their careers.

They've been lied to and confused over the last couple of decades by bitter feminists who go too far with their ideologies which has confused ladies ""future planning"" and crushed their budding imaginations. ""Romance"" and marriage has been demonized and is ruining today's young ladies. 

Guys continuously pollute their minds but fueling their imaginations with endless video games comics and animation, never quite growing up. 

But they know what they expect to see with each new super hero movie. 

They recognize bullsh¡t when they see it and demented feminazis denigrate them unfairly as chauvinists when they don't like what they see.

Men have _allowed_ women to become like this so blame men. They've also failed to take charge and be the leaders the population needs. When men don't step up, women fill the void and we get what we have now. 

It's still mens fault. Women wear the pants in the family while the husband acts like a grown child playing video games all the time. This forces the wife to take over HIS responsibilities AND hers while he diddles himself like a little boy.

"This reminds me of Prego and their FAILED attempt to find one perfect pasta sauce.

In the 70's IIRC, Prego was trying to engineer their pasta sauce to be ""perfect"", so they could corner the market and sell more sauce, and make more money. They had whittled their sauces down to 2 kinds and wanted to know which to go with, spicy or plain sauce. Enter Dr. Howard Moskowitz, market researcher and psychologist. He was hired for his previous work with Pepsi, who tried to determine the ""best"" amount of sweetener in Diet Pepsi. Turns out, there was no uniform consistence across their audience, in fact, it was fairly even across the board. Can you guess what happened next?

When Dr. Moskowitz was handed the Prego project, he developed 45 different types of spaghetti sauce for testing and found there was an ENTIRE kind of sauce that Prego was ignoring. CHUNKY. Turns out it was a three way tie between what those kinds of sauces. Well, Prego decided to listen to him and make the new sauce to see how well it performed. The result was $600 million dollars in 10 years from the chunky sauce line alone.

Turns out not everything is for everybody.

"1 I can totally confirm that the two sexes have different tastes. Both in the university and at school, most of the students in my class were girls and they definitely didn't look like the type of people who'd go watch Top Gun or The Terminator (there was one exception, but she was raised as a dude). They had no interest in metal and gaming, let alone sci-fi and darkly inclined fiction. I was one of the few girls that were actually into that and in my university class, I was literally the only one. No matter how offensive it may sound to chronically online people, women who enjoy action, gaming and all this other stuff (especially women who are masculine on top of their masculine interests) are a minority. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging that. I think the problem is that said chronically online types seem to equate someone saying ""women tend to like romance and melodramas"" with ""women are not allowed to enjoy action and thrillers"", when the latter is NOT what people are saying.

2 I think the problem is that they're not exactly portraying masculine traits, but rather what they THINK men are like. Instead of portraying genuinely masculine women (if that's the hill they want to die on) like Rain Ocampo and Vasquez from Alien, they choose to portray snooty, rude and insufferable women who often overpower men in spite of being ordinary humans. It doesn't help that acknowledging that Rey and Carol Danvers are Mary Sues is now deemed sexist, even if you're a woman yourself. 

3 Mary Sues are a separate topic for discussion, but they are pushed like female empowerment. As someone who has rose tinted glasses regarding Paul Anderson's RE franchise, I'm thankful that Alice was never pushed as an icon for female empowerment. But even Alice had an excuse for being so powerful: bonding with the T Virus. Mulan from the live action remake is an ordinary human and doesn't have that excuse. I'm not empowered by someone who never struggles and never has any issues in life. I'm empowered by someone who has issues and overcomes them.

4 These stories are written BY chronically online people FOR chronically online people. We as a general audience are only taken into consideration when it's time for us to be guilt tripped by them into watching it. There is a way to promote feminist narratives without being performative, condescending or hateful, but it's clear that they just want to turn their Tumblr 2016 rant into a full length movie. They are also the reason why beloved franchises are ruined. Notice how people don't have an issue with Jinx Johnson and Michelle Yeoh's character from Tomorrow Never Dies, they only have an issue with Captain Marvel and Rey, so the problem is not sexism, but chronically online people being given the opportunity to do something they're incapable of doing: writing a good story.

5. There's a clear lack of diversity in women, i.e. diversity in personality. This gap in western media is why East Asian media is winning now. Not very long ago, you could see different types of women in media: calm, loud, extroverted, docile, active, you name it. Now it's a copy paste of the same type that you know you'll see in pretty much every western female character today.","[""Well said!

"the funny thing is, there's plenty of successful franchises with male target audiences while also having plenty of strong, female characters from japan, anime is in part pushing comics out of the western market because the people that write that stuff understand how to entertain an audience

my favorite example is always the Fate franchise and the extended Nasuverse as a whole as it is easily comparable to Marvel, both are massive multiverses with plenty of different writers for it and recurring characters and yet the most popular character from the Nasuverse is Saber who, on the surface, goes through the same stuff as these modern Marvel ""girlbosses"", it also has the male characters looking down on her but she shuts them up by showing how much more powerful than them she is, hell she even has the struggle of having to hide her gender to be taken more seriously in her position, but unlike modern Marvel, she actually has well thought out writing backing her, interesting character traits, believable and relatable weaknesses and fears and her character arc even includes reconciliation with her own femininity all while she is still being a girlboss that kicks all kinds of ass and while she is certainly the best writing wise, she's by no means an exception",[],2024-02-21T19:00:13Z,@GBlockbreaker

"Fun fact: most women don't even buy this narrative, even the ones that watch these movies. 

I used to be a part time freelance photographer for some dance academies during my college years (I also had a scholarship and took dance classes in one of them). I remember one day (around the time the first Captain Marvel was on theaters) I was leaving one of these academies after a class and there were a few moms outside talking (I was the only male so they knew me and they always said hi to me), they were talking about Marvel movies of all things and every single one of them said how much they DIDN'T like Captain Marvel and that she came across as so unlikeable while they were mentioning the heroes they actually liked like Captain America and Bruce Banner. It was kinda funny. 

None of my female cousins liked Captain Marvel and neither of them were interested in the sequel. My mom and sister didn't watch the first Captain Marvel when we watched Endgame in the theater but they did not like Captain Marvel in that movie. 

These big companies can't even pander properly, the few females who appreciate these movies even in a casual way don't like this narrative! Lol",[],2024-02-21T18:59:58Z,@reeda1746

I would have taken my husband to see Maverick: Top Gun in the theater, but the bits of the movie I've heard included a woman complaining something about ""that's why they call him Hangman, he always leaves you hanging,"" and it grates on my nerves.  As far as romances go, no tv show can do a romance: if two characters have good chemistry, they split them up immediately, have them sleep with everyone else in the cast, and they might finally smash them back together when no one cares anymore.  And romantic movies are a thing of the past.  Barbie wasn't a romance, and Disney's Snow White refuses to be as well.

Look at women in male orientated movies. 2 shining bastions - 

Sarah Connor. Ellen Ripley. Both in movie aimed at men but still written as women. They're still feminine. Heck, Ripley's maternal instinct, even though she's terrified, forced her through hell for Newt.

And Sarah? Not only would John not exist without her, he wouldn't have been anywhere near as capable of a leader as he is without her. Iron sharpens iron but Sarah was the blacksmith that forged John.

Anyone with a functioning brain must have known the war was over a year before Berlin was literally surrounded and getting pounded by Russian artillery, in addition to Americans advancing from the west.

The Germans had lost long ago. All the evidence was there. If any leadership truly cared about German society, they should have accepted defeat and surrendered to America to get the best possible terms for their people.

But they just couldn't admit they were wrong, and that their visions of being the chosen people in a ""National Socialist"" world order, was pure ego and hubris crumbling to dust in the course of history.

"2:55 Keep in mind, when it comes to audience demographics:
The reason women make up 85% of Romance films, and men only make up 75% of action movies; is because generally speaking, Women are more agreeable, and will tolerate a movie for men. Just so they can be with the men in there lives.

"Here is the reason that female action heroes often wind up being so insufferable:
In real life, women are seldom the action heroes. They are sometimes, but not typically. A male action hero, in the real world, is a fairly common occurrence. Well over 9 times out of 10, when someone wins a battle, rescues an old lady from a burning building, kills a lion, etc., it's a man. And why is this important? Well, because male action heroes are so normal in the real world, you can't make a whole movie based on the concept of ""Look, it's a MAN doing action hero stuff!"" You have to give him an interesting personality, a character arc, etc., otherwise he's indistinguishable from every one of the hundreds of millions of real-life male action heroes that have already lived. 

But with a woman, that's not the case. Women are not commonly in action hero situations in the real world. They are sometimes, but not typically. And so, for your movie to stand out and be interesting at first glance, you don't have to put any effort into your female action hero. You can make your whole movie based on ""Look, it's a WOMAN doing action hero stuff!"" because that's something that you don't see every day.

And what's the problem? Because you can ride this female action hero as your only original thought, the whole phenomenon is going to die out pretty quickly. If you're completely obsessed with your girl power moment, you'll neglect the personality and character arc of your hero. And this is how you get Rey beating Kylo Ren (supposedly a combat expert) in her first lightsaber fight ever, Captain Marvel completely obliterating anything she comes across, etc. 

But it can really become a balancing act, because if you try to focus a lot on the more realistic, character, non-super-girl-power aspects of your female action hero, things can easily fall apart. Women, on average, are smaller, weaker, and (dare I say) more timid than men. Any woman who is going to become an action hero on par with most realistic male characters is going to go through immense amounts of training, failure, etc. before she can beat most men. Trying to demonstrate this on screen is inevitably going to look a lot different than what we currently have. 

The world is tough. In most combat scenarios throughout history, women have been almost non-factors. There have been exceptions, like Soviet female snipers during WWII, and the growing number of female combat troops in recent years, but in general this is a rule of thumb. This isn't to say that women have been non-factors in history itself - history is much broader than just combat scenarios (Which probably make up less than 1% of human history all told.), and women are undoubtedly just as important to any functional civilization as men, on a ton of different levels, and in some instances even more important. All I'm saying is that integrating them seamlessly into action and combat is an unrealistic undertaking. It's going to be a bumpy ride, and any movie that attempts to bring them into combat has to recognize this.",[],2024-02-21T18:53:07Z,@gunsgalore7571

The problem is, if you put a woman into a similar setup, she reads as boring, bitchy, girl boss, etc. Now take in genre, these women are being placed in. It's all superhero nonsense.

As far as changing their films, they've fired and blackballed most their older and more experienced writers and crews.    As the Drinker himself has pointed out, the replacements have neither the talent nor the life experience to write believable stories and characters.  You can't teach a fish to walk, and in order to return to the stuff that sells that's what they're going to have to do.  They've also managed to piss off a big chunk of their audience so much that they're not coming back no matter what the studios do.  Beginning in about 2016 or so they've let the masks slip off and told us what they really think of us, and it ain't pretty.  Maybe they always felt that way about ordinary people and hid it well, or maybe their utter contempt for their audience is a recent phenomenon, it doesn't matter.

"A major flaw of both this film and the marvels isn't the characters or the actors involved. The flaw is the writers and potentially the studio forced re writes that messed up the vision. They are both rather poorly written. In the case of Web it's not only poorly written, but it's poorly filmed based on every review I've seen that wasn't paid for by the studio. 

Girl boss films could work if they had a good story, had good filming, and in the case of hero films, had a recognizable hero. Wonder woman didn't appear on the list of girl boss flops. Morbius didn't either but should have. 

Because the problem is the c grade super hero character films are being written poorly, or with studio interference, and filmed poorly, and in the case of girl boss films often with an agenda in mind. I suspect that when a film comes out and the insiders at the studio know it's tested poorly but they are releasing anyways, they start to push the dumb agenda to try to push for a female audience with lesser expectations to show up and use the culture war to push the film.

"Catering to ""The Message"" is merely a consequence of studios having already squeezed the blood from the stone of their target demos and the executives tasking creative to find new demos to fill additional seats and increase profits. Top Gun didn't need to cater to a different audience. It had it's audience and it delivered. Same with Barbie. But Marvel and superhero movies in general have tapped the same well for 20 years. They need to find more fertile demos so they went to women because that demo wasn't saturated. Even at the risk of alienating the existing fans who made superhero movies what they are.

"I really hope you're right about the Girlboss Era being dead and over Drinker. Creativity in Hollywood has been badly affected by this trend, and the worst thing is that it didn't even need to happen. Propaganda is people's worst enemy, and it drove a number of figures to pump out movies that needed to educate men about how they were nothing but sexist pigs that deserved to be looked down on, humiliated and emasculated, while women needed only to throw off the chains of the patriarchy in order to become their true selves. People came to watch the movies to escape that kind of thing, not to have it be constantly shoved down their throats. I only pray the pendulum is truly starting the swing the other way, however I fear it may be too late for the likes of Star Wars and Marvel. The damage has already been done there as far as I'm concerned, and in the case of Star Wars, there's no sign of Kathleen Kennedy's stewardship being challenged, and people can't tell me Dave Filoni because I don't think he's got any room to manoeuvre there.",[],2024-02-21T18:34:25Z,@richardphilpott1013

"Last year, a book called MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios was published. I came across it in a comic shop in Manchester. I was almost convinced to buy it until I leafed through the book and came across the chapter on Captain Marvel. The authors blame ""sexist nerds"" for the character, her actress and her movie dying on arrival. That chapter is a perfect example of a lack of accountability which has become the norm in recent years. Unless you're heterosexual, white and a man, it's never your fault. It's racism, sexism, etc. 

MCU: The Story of Marvel Studios was published in 2023, and aged like milk before it's even a year old. The Marvels, Echo and Madame Web have all been trainwrecks. The way these people have tried to handle the situation is the equivalent of trying to put out a fire with petrol.","[""Hmmm whos' gonna buy a book like that.

"The cabal of institutional investors that control markets and promote ESG are a large part of the of this picture. 

The big media and tech companies are so dominant and bloated they are often contemptuous of their actual consumers. They can be, as often we have little alternative to use them (eg if we want to access the content these bastards have bought up)… and the more gargantuan a corporation becomes the more contempt they show to consumers and the more they spend time in a small bubble courting, placating and circle-jerking the wealthy corporate elites who hold dominion over the global market place. 

Add into that the ideological madness of woke that is the Borg of western countries and you have a recipe for a dreadful era of quasi-religious, corporate gruel. 

Its why they continue to ignore the voice of the man on the street and dismiss them as trolls and bigots. Eventually… EVENTUALLY…… a contempt for a consumer will be terminal to a business.

"It's one more example of 'the message' getting in the way of the story, and reality in general. Superhero movies are a male-oriented genre. And they should market it towards the target audience, instead of writing it for themselves for a self-congratulatory pat on the shoulder. ""Barbie"" is the prime example that a genre for females and marketed to them can turn out great for studios. The solution is to just write well-written, complex and believable characters. Or to put it even simpler, just write good characters. Men can identify with female protagonists (take Ripley and Sarah Connor for example).

Just as strange is the reaction afterwards. Everything about these movies screams that it's more for woman.... but then blame men for not showing up when it flops. Sometimes after saying ""It's not for you""

"In recent years, we’ve seen this popular argument about “representation” on social media.  The argument is basically that there are apparently legions of women and girls who would dearly love to get into sci fi, action, fantasy and other entertainment genres but what puts them off is that they don’t see other women either watching it and/or starring in them, and this in turn means that women and girls don’t receive the kind of empowering message they need.

The problem is that this is completely untrue and the people making this argument are not *really* interested in this stuff.  They just wanted to get on their soapbox about something.

Individuals who have to actually grow, learn & overcome difficult obstacle by relying upon others or reconsider pre conceived notions about reality & themselves.

"Hey drinker, it's your Canadian buddy, Scott coming at you from Toronto. As a Canadian, I am required by law to watch and play hockey, so I do my civic duty.

Why am I telling you this? It's because almost every year we have the same discussion up here about women's hockey. Why isn't it more popular? Why aren't more people going? Why can't the women hockey players earn a living from playing hockey, etc. etc. etc. 

Occasionally some moron brings up the equal pay for equal work argument, but we ignore stupidity...

The reason why women's hockey is not popular or self-sustaining, is because men are the primary viewers of professional sports. Period. Not women, men.

If men decide to watch professional sports, they will probably watch men's sports because they are men, and because it is generally the pinnacle of human competition. There are some exceptions where women's sports can be popular, like tennis, golf, gymnastics and a whole host of others, but I'm not sure those are the same as women trying to play hockey, football, basketball, baseball, etc., which are much more taxing and dangerous than the aforementioned.

I was watching a YouTube show or a television program with a debate about this very topic and one of the men, I mean toxic males, on the panel asked all of the women to name their top three professional women's hockey players. 

As you can imagine, not only did they not know any of the players, only one of them could name a team in the women's professional hockey League.

"now, imho, you CAN make a movie most audiences will enjoy... and can mix sci-fi and rom/rom-com/etc elements easy enough... and have it work well... it just takes somebody whos not working off an ideology whos goal is creating good content not pushing an agenda....

one thing my mother said about for example The Fifth Element was that she always liked the movie despite not being very into sci-fi because the interactions between the MC's were so good, and when she realized zorg was oldman... well... shes always blown away how he can chameleon so well...

now she isnt anti-sci-fi... her dad was a trek fan and she did carry on the family watching tng long after grandad died(i can remember him but not all that clearly i was very young when he died but i do remember watching trek from his knee... and him commenting about the show, actors, guest stars, etc.. ) 

but... she admits alot of why she likes some of the same movies i do, is they have some elements that bring in generas she likes, romance, drama, romcom, and detectivy stuff... its also why she has liked some shows i recommended despite not thinking she would... deadwood... thats a show that everybody i know eventually came to love.. even a buddies very devout xian mom during cv19 hurt her knee and as she was running out of shit to binge and was on pain killers.. she started watching... 1.5seasons in the womans using the shows catchphrase...and watching with 3 of her church friends who had trouble getting past the lang but once they did... ""its really good"" as one told us on voice chat... 

on the other hand there are shows/movies that only tomboy geek girls seem to be that into(i mean along side men/boys/guys), and, there are a shitload of movies specifically targeting women knowing men are going to be a very very very small % of the audience mostly coming with women... 

oh the other hand again... i think most guys can admit they have seen at least one romance/comedy/drama that was mostly outside our wheel house, but was actually really good... hell...i have seen a few that were mostly drama/romance but set in a sci-fi or fantasy backdrop that was well written/thought out enough that... it had me wanting more content from that universe more targeted at my tastes that went more in dept on the tech and such..",[],2024-02-21T17:56:55Z,@AshenTech

"Re: ""You're not gonna get equal numbers of women to watch science fiction or action or super hero movies, just like you're not gonna get equal numbers of men to watch romance flicks or musicals."" 

I’m not sure that is always true. I do agree that you are never going to achieve either of those aims by shallow pandering to your audience. But a good story with real artistic merit can appeal to both men and women in a big way.

Maybe my experience was an anomaly, but I remember when THE TERMINATOR came out in 1984. Here was a science fiction action movie with car chases and gunfights and a killer robot. But it was also THE “date night” movie of the year. I remember my friends’ older sisters and my babysitters enthusiastically going to see THE TERMINATOR not just once but over and over and over again. THE TERMINATOR had a huge female audience even though it had the car chases and guns and killer robots. It also had relatable relationships, comedy, working class woes, romance, and one of the all-time great heroines in Sarah Connor. Women loved that movie, and guys loved it too. 

Was that an anomaly?

I don’t think so, because I sure watched all THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies in theaters with a lot of women attending --- and it wasn’t always just the ladies wiping away tears in certain scenes.

Preferably about the same thing as their circle-jerk group on Twitter was moaning about, so they could all give each other a thumbs up, retreat, and a reach-around. But that was it.

"The type of person who makes you feel bad about yourself is called an abuser.   It's a classic trait of the malignant narcissist.  To make you doubt your own worth, and feel bad for who you are.

Remember guys, you're not the ones in the wrong for liking particular shows, nor are you in the wrong for simply being male.   And keep in mind that those who seek to make you feel this way, are the ones with the issues, they are the people who feel the need to control others, because they are lacking within themselves.  They need to make you feel bad about yourself, so they can feel good about themselves.  They need to put you down, below them, as they are incapable of raising themselves up to your level. 

Do not hate them, but pity them instead.  Do not raise to their bait, as that is how they lure you in.  The best response to give a narcissist, is no response at all.  It will drive them wild, and they will explode with rage and fury, and reveal to the world just who they truly are.  Damaged individuals with major insecurities and terrible self esteem.  

Do not think you can cure these people, because you can't.  Only they can, that is the essence of self esteem.  Do not allow them to take yours because they don't have any.   

Do not try and teach them the error of their ways.  Do not engage.  Ignore and retreat, and you will win every battle with them.   Engage, and you play on their terms, and they will win.  

Consider this.  

If a man and a woman are having an argument in a cafe, and the woman starts crying, everyone will think the man a b'stard.

"I've been a Western media geek and an anime nerd since I was in middle school.  

I think in addition to the storytelling and characters in manga being better done, manga has always managed to create stories in every type of genre for men and women by STICKING to what naturally appeals to and resonates with men or women.  

You have the magical girl genre, which is basically superhero films MADE FOR GIRLS.  They feature superhero themes but the style, problems, themes, and plotlines are what appeal more to women.  A lot of them have high-stakes melodrama and romance at the core of their plots.  Sailor Moon is a key example.  

Conversely, they are able to market basically romances to men through the ""harem genre,"" because it leans into a male protagonist's fantasy of being surrounded by a lot of women who want to date him, but dealing with guy issues like growing up to be the better man to protect the women or save the world.

And of course everything else in between genre-wise usually has better chance of appealing to men and women because the men and women are written to have character traits and concerns that are coherent to most men and women.  Japan has even been progressive with characters possessing gender atypical traits, or being queer in some way, etc., and it never felt preachy or even fake because they were relatable characters in the story.

Western media could have adopted Japan's approach to make genres appeal to the opposite gender, but it didn't, and it becomes clear that a large reason for this is because of financial/find the lowest common denominator impulses, but moreso because ideology is trying to tell us there is no difference socially, mentally, or sometimes biologically between men and women.  (Combined with the fact women are pressuring other women to not like ""stereotypical women things"" anymore.)  

The entertainment industry has conducted a massive social engineering experiment on gender roles and it actually generated more data indicative that the sexes are different, not that they are as similar as they say.  Are there outliers?  Of course.  Should they be discriminated against?  No.  But do they represent 95% of the population?  No.",[],2024-02-21T17:46:12Z,@Sidera17

In order to get women to go to these types of franchises (Star Wars, Marvel, DC, etc), you first have to make the men happy.
The men will sing the praises for the movies, thus intriguing women into seeing it.
Women didn't start getting into Marvel until it was already blowing up. And it was blowing up because they were satisfying the fans.

What we have today are these ""girl boss bi-ch"" films where they are Mary Sues with no character development, no real struggles because they are already better than the men. But what is worse, there is this need to depict the ""good"" men as dumb, sexist, arrogant, etc. and the women need to show them up. I don't want to see a film where the main theme of the film is ""women good, men bad"" in all circumstances. They modern girl boss films are more sexist than any era and genre I can think of.

In addition, if you look at what lies to the right of 110 on the horizontal axis (male genres) and compare that to what lies to the left of 90 on the same axis (female genres) the male genres outnumber the female genres by 8 to 2 or 6 to 2 if we are being generous, and everything that they tried to make female-centric in the MCU, DCU, LucasFilms, Game of Thrones/Lord of the Ring, Star Trek, Spiderverse is MALE.

"Tons of manga's and anime's most popular female characters could be considered ""girlboss"" and yet they find an appeal","['To be honest, I find much of anime and manga to be the opposite end of the problem, where they make so many of the ladies too weak in character. Not just in physicality, but also in personality (where they are extremely emotional or exaggerated) and contribution to the story. \n\nWhat I find ironic is that both Hollywood and numerous animanga seem to assume that traditional femininity is weak, despite the fact that historical women were nuanced and extremely helpful to societies. There\'s so many things you could do with a ""traditional"" female character such as helping people get through times of war while men are away. But hardly anyone wants to give it a shot.\n\nOf course, as you said, there are female characters in animanga who are well-written. But lets not assume that the industry is without its problems.', 'Well it depends on the genres. Shonen(boy) manga/anime is usually and almost always headlined by strong interesting male characters that get stronger and stronger as the series progresses, with interesting female side characters that actually act as supporting characters to the main male characters and nothing more. Shoujo(girl) manga/anime is geared towards the traditional female Japanese teenage audience and has more drama and romance in it instead of pure action and power-ups. Again, manga and anime in Japan is strictly divided between genres that are based on the traditional divide of the two genders, so even if you have a female-led Shonen anime or manga, it\'s still going to be designed in a way to appeal to the 13 -15 year old Japanese boys.\n\nSeinen manga/anime for example, is strictly aimed for Japanese men of 18+ and above, and it contains adult material of the most extreme kind that wouldn\'t pass in most Western countries, like in ""Berserk"", "" Blade of the Immortal"" and the likes.', '@@cadethumann8605 This is not an issue unless you are a westerner and has no understanding of how traditional Japanese society is. They don\'t make them ""too weak"", they simply make them as supporting characters in genres that specifically aim towards Japanese boys and men like Shonen and Seinen. What you refer to are female side characters in the Shonen genre for the most part, that are usually portrayed as such because it\'s the traditional male power trip in the way it\'s designed and there\'s nothing wrong with that. There are many anime and manga where the female protagonists are very strong mentally and physically, so your initial statement is in fact inaccurate.', '@rpgadventurer32\xa0 That\'s quite the generalization of what men want where they find women being  sexualized and acting childish to be a ""power trip"". Even if you wish to prioritize male characters getting thr limelight, you could at least still have FC behave somewhat human. What\'s worse is that many are out into compromising situations against their will such as being upskirted, being SA as ""humor"", or having their clothing torn for ""fanservice"". Even when I was a teenage boy, I never found this appealing.\n\nAnd you want to know something? People can have their cake and eat it too and still have it written well.

Im glad they only made 2 Terminator movies"", ""Problem is women like Ripley have DEPTH and SELFLESSNESS, something most narcissistic, modern women are incapable of.
