"Funnily enough, Anne Hathaway later starred in a film with the exact opposite message of The Devil Wears Prada - The Intern. She plays the head of a fashion company who's considering hiring a CEO to give herself less work - because her husband is the stay at home dad who's having an affair. But the end message is that the husband needs to work on his insecurities, which he does by ending the affair, confessing everything and assuring her to stay in control of her company. And she's portrayed as a nice boss as well, although her assistant is a bit overworked.

Lets be honest here. How many of  relation actually have father in equation anymore? Divorce and single parenthood are the mores.  Marriage or even men seem to be secondary thought now days. Secondly was it not how men were portrayed as boss men (for decades in cinema) who took their wives for granted and focused on career. And hence wives fell into arms of their new love .  What is good for goose is good for gander. This is conundrum of feminism. It was built on anti marriage foundation (if we actually take time to read about its history) and yet could not obliterate evolutionary rules which is propagation of species which fueled the whole patriarchal structure meant to protect the children.

I think a big reason why you have the double standard of women having to give up family to have a career while men are able to have both is that women tend to not be attracted to men who make less money than they do. One person usually has to be the primary moneymaker while the other parent has to be the primary childcare giver and women tend to lose attraction for men who take on the primary domestic role. The husband picks up on that loss of attraction and it causes stress in the marriage.,"[""That is a load of alt-right bullcrap.  That is not reality at all.

"First of all I have to admit that when I hear Girl Boss I just think of early seventies Japanese Girl Gang movies.

I often think about the differences males and females,  such as often when someone is hurt or unwell  males will pretty much ignore the person while more often that not females will care about said persons well being.

"The issue for me is that we continue to define success in the parameters of a materialist and shallow capitalist society which glorifies recognition or fame, wealth and upper class privilege. 
Why should anyone, women or men, put a premium on sacrificing our time and family for these kind of returns. Our values are often warped. We are expected to use, consume without conscience and approve, even if apathetically, exploitive industries and methods. Not just to blue collar or oversea workers but to even the close around us. 

Women aspire to success within their career which can be good or bad depending on where your values are compromised. There's nothing wrong with opting to not have children but sacrificing all meaningful human relationships for your career will only make you unhappy and is a poor representation of a full and balanced life. That goes for any human being. However there's also something to be said about doing meaningful work, it just shouldn't be scrutinized on the basis of making money or being successful in a certain kind of way that is praised in our society. 

For myself, creating a meaningful life is about balance. Recognizing values require responsibility to the duties that feed those values. Unfortunately, household duties or familial relational duties and the emotional work that it requires as well as the practical, is often demeaned as unimportant compared to making money or acquiring accolades in public life. We continue to see the household (our home where we nourish and rest) and children as burdens to split instead of things to cherish. Perhaps it is the patriarchal influence that we still define these by. 

We should want to put time in with family and relationships, seeking after work that makes a qualitative difference for others and inspires you to think beyond yourself and your accumulation. Conscious exploration of your interests and loves. 
You really do have to constantly pull back here and give there and then the next moment give there and pull back here. You can't have it all in equal measures, it's about constantly readjusting. We only have so much time and ourselves to give so you have to choose wisely.

The honest situation is that societal and cultural expectations are what shape our experience and instead of consciously deciding, we fall into the grooves of these expectations. Men are pressured to be breadwinners over being caretakers and vice versa for women. But carving out your own path in regards to these shouldn't be formulaic.
 My mother was the primary breadwinner and my father often took care of us. Not in a way that demeaned either one of them to be chained to that. And roles changed over years with my mother being able to have more the with us in other parts of our lives. I never thought that one person did one thing in our family. We all did caretaking, chores, shared financial responsibilities. However, in my life with my partner, we have had to mix up roles in a more traditional way because we have different circumstances.

"The opportunity gap definitely exists... Insecure seems interesting! I‚Äôll have to watch that.
When we pursue career success, it‚Äôs harder to do so than it is for men. Basically when you strive to have it all, ur often left with nothing. In business, career success is relational and as an attractive young female, you‚Äôre less likely to be seen as capable and more likely to be seen as a liability in taking time off to have children or someone they can‚Äôt be as comfortable around. For the past decade, I‚Äôve been laser focused on developing my technical and soft skills, and I can‚Äôt say that has gotten me far. Pulling all nighters to get something done isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve ever seen my male peers have to do. And in return, I usually get more ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù, dull projects, someone else‚Äôs job in addition to mine who is entry level, etc. I can‚Äôt wait for the day that women aren‚Äôt pigeonholed or discriminated in the workforce for their sex. In my career in corporate finance, you‚Äôll find many women as analysts and accountants but few as managers and I‚Äôve yet to meet more than 1 female CFO.

"Men in high pressure CEO positions also sacrifice having a good family life. Most often they have a wife who raises the kids and she doesn't work very much outside of that. Theoretically this would also work with a stay at home dad. There is a LARGE stigma against this, it's not all ""poor waman have to do all the child raising"". Men and women look down on men who do the typlical female role. That's why if a woman tries to make it in a high pressure career in the same way a man would she ends up without a family. Not to mention women trend to want to marry men who are more successful than them.

Undermining the idea that childcare - is something that you don‚Äôt want something that is below. 

It‚Äôs exactly what‚Äô some  man did before: ohh yeah childcare is nothing only people who are below want to do it AKA women

Yeah you rock it! - if they are career wise successful

‚ÄòYou are so petty. I want my OWN life not some crying annoying thing‚Äô

"Another issue I have with the girlboss narrative is that is distorts what a working woman looks like. We need to celebrate working class women. Not just the ones that are executives at problematic corporations. Being an executive at an oil company, for example, isn't a good form of feminism. Women do tend to be more drawn to pro-social careers. Women are more likely to become teachers, nurses, most nonprofits I have experience with are female dominated. These are all careers where someone may have a great impact on the lives of others, but they may not be paid a high salary for it.","['Also thinking of Coco where the great-great-grandmother started a shoe business that lasted decades after her death and ensures the family stays comfortable because whether the economy falls or rises, people will need shoes.', ""What makes it worse is that because of the tendency to dominate pro-social careers, women are often guilt tripped into doing more and more work for no extra compensation because they're doing it for the kids/sick/underprivileged.

"Not every one  can be, or needs to be in a high-status leadership position to be a strong and worthwhile woman and family and outside-work life should be able to work for women, since it clearly works for many men. But with everyone having so much difficulty moving up in the workforce choices about jobs both are and feel very stark and terribly unjust sacrifices feel necessary for women and everyone else.  Even well before my own generation, I see just so many women who are CLEARLY wired for management and really driven who never get there.  I have no trouble seeing the wage gap and the glass ceilings and sticky floors.  Meanwhile, this whole evil female boss fear is this deeply chilling doom mindset, no mater how we rig our work/home balance. The struggle to feel boss-level control cuts accross all sexes and stripes and creeds, since work is so precarious in general and is a trap for women in particular (and in particular anyone dealing with compound oppression from other stigmatized identities).  The metaphor that seems most impactful here is the one of reality TV, where competition is cutthroat and people struggle simply to remain in the game.  Is there anyone in today's entertainment fiction making it work to have even a little of everything, nevermind having it all?  The possibility seems restricted to TV shows no newer than the 80s.  By all means mention any current TV girl workers who overwhelmingly make it work like that, but I really don't see it.  It's become hard to immagine.

"Interesting point of view, but still leaning heavily on a lot of debunked facts. It's funny how people are now switching to ""Opportunity Gap"" now that the ""Wage Gap"" and ""Pink Tax"" have been thoroughly refuted for years.

Mentioning that women choose to take a stall in their careers in order to start or raise a family is important when talking about slower advancement. Pointing out that there are many more women in middle management rolls and management as a whole is also critical, while their are less women in both that upper CEO level AND in the lowest, bottom rung jobs. Recent studies show this is mostly intelligence driven; the average woman is more intelligent than the average man, the least intelligent men are less intelligent than the least intelligent females, but the smartest men tend to be more intelligent that the smartest females.

So you see exactly what you would expect. Men being the majority in the most unskilled, more labor focused jobs; women being the majority in mid-level jobs and most management positions, because both of those have lots of positions available. Then yes, men usually ""win out"" in those top of the food chain jobs because there are so few of them and its highly competitive, and there are more of them qualified enough for those jobs.

It's not an even playing field, but a meritocracy isn't supposed to be. We can try to do better on the springboard people start from, but people are going to turn out how they are, and there are biological factors to consider when you see who ends up where via macro trends.

Not saying the whole video is wrong or it's not worth watching/considering, but there seems to be an obvious slant/bias here.","['A) where is the proof / source that men are peaking at higher IQ\nB) Success at a job is not really solely reliant on IQ.', ""@@munstergirl25 https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/study-of-1-6-million-grades-shows-little-gender-difference-in-maths-and-science-at-school-101242\n\nYou are correct on B.

"I am usually very skeptical about the ""feminist"" approach, which most of the times seems to victimize women (saying that we are the victims because we do not have the same opportunities, even in those cases where we do) or to want to assert females over men rather than as peers, but I really liked this video. As Jordan Peterson says, studies proved that even when given the opportunity, less women took up leading jobs because we tend to have different expectations from life and different ideas of family compared to men: our instincts lead to nurture and care for others, but this should not mean that it is less valuable or useful in business, law or marketing.

"Lindsay: ""Hey guys, I'm Lindsay Ellis"" 
me: *liked* 

Seriously though, it's kinda tragic how any modern rich country can fall into the work vs. family dichotomy trap. As far as I have seen, the relationships and support you have in private are crucial to success if anything. So many even moderately successful women have the kind of supportive man behind them that can sadly be counted as extraordinary. Rich people pay to have housework done to save time. In my country, daycare became a major political issue in the 70's precisely because women can't usually work if it isn't available, and that's also a big reason to why split parental leave is so important. 

Few myths in the modern world are so dangerous as the one that one person can achieve anything on their own.",[],2020-01-07T21:22:39Z,@mimimurlough

open question: which series/movies portray a woman boss in a healthy way?,"['Jacqueline Carlyle from the Bold Type <3', 'Working Girl with Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith and 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton are two of my personal favorite examples. They\'re both movies from the 1980s, but feel very ahead of their time in terms of how they approach girlbossing. Working Girl really dives into how business is very patriarchy oriented, and sexism dominates the industry. Tess (Melanie Griffith) initially looks up to Katharine (Signourney Weaver), who\'s like the textbook girlboss, but ultimately realizes that Katharine\'s approach to it is just as toxic as those of her male counterparts. Tess maintains both her ambitions and her ethics in the end and is rewarded for it (not to spoil the movie too much). 9 to 5 is a bit more power fantasy, since it focuses on three women who get to stick it to their terrible lecherous boss in a hilariously extreme way, but a huge theme of the film is the women learning that in order to overcome this unfair system, they have to work together, not pit themselves against each other, and a lot of why they become successful bossbabes is because they make the workplace a positive environment for the other women they work with, creating a system that makes it easier for them to ""have it all"" so to speak.', 'Oh, another good example is Carolyn Knapp Schappey, from the BBC Radio Series Cabin Pressure, which is just a cracking series all around', '@@elizabethkeller9261 the 9-5  movie was excelent!']",2020-01-07T20:54:33Z,@evildoesnotsleep-x2b

"When you did the male/female comparison of home duties, and mentioned women are half the workforce now, you need to explore full time VS part time/casual work. I do the majority of the housework, but I work part time, my husband is full time.

In my household we both work fulltime, run my own business (no, not a blog, or etsy shop), and do most of the housework, not by choice.

Come to think of it, my mother did the same - multiple jobs, dealt with school affairs and general parenting, etc. The ""If she can do it, why can\'t I"" attitude from his end has landed us in counseling. On the other hand, I have a few friends who work fulltime while their partner is a stay at home father. Or single dads that are flying solo when the mother completely checked out. And of course a few ""classic"" couple agreements for stay at home moms. I think bottom line is that what she said wasn\'t meant to be ""war on men"".
