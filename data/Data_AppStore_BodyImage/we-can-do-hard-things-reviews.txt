Epic - the best podcast around. A ‘must’ Episode 370 is so powerful- highly recommend
Bringing the relatable actionable work I have been listening to several episodes over the last couple of weeks and have found I am looking forward to hearing the hosts voices and what they are sharing next.  “Lifing” is hard and “the work”, though hard is hopefully making the “lifing” easier and more fulfilling.  Thank you crew for showing up, sharing personal experience and expert advice from guests to support the work your listeners are facing.
Best of Thanks so much for all your work! Love you all! Never miss an episode! Really grateful that you are now putting “best of” when you are repeating episodes as I would start them and think “I’m sure I’ve heard this”. It makes it really transparent so I have a choice to listen or not. The work you do is priceless in this world 💗💗💗
I learn so much I love the deep conversations. I learn so much & feel it helps me live a more conscious life.
Love it so much it aches I love this a podcast so much. I’ve only recently started listening and I listen as a fall asleep and the same episode again when i wake in the morning. It’s soothing, enlightening and open hearted and It gives me so much comfort and information. It’s the right start and finish for my day.  Thank you
Mind blown I had to listen to the first 8 minutes of episode 346 four times to let it sink in….. OMG
Abby’s biggest loss Thankyou for sharing your story. I lost my son, grief is not talked about enough , we often feel like we go through it alone , your story really helped me. The grief portal resonated with me very much. Thankyou so much and I am very sorry for your l loss of your beautiful brother, he sounds like he was a great man x
Abby and her dear bro I just wanted to thank Abby so much for sharing the experience of her brother’s death with such incredible depth and detail. I listened on the third anniversary of my mum’s death and it was really grounding to listen to the reflections on grief that really don’t get a lot of air play. Thank you
Love it….BUT…. I enjoy the podcast very much…BUT Please please please moderate yours and your guests voices, if you laugh, back away from mic, ask everyone to speak at similar volume.   Kara Swisher was great but I couldn’t hear half of what she said unless I turned up my headphones, as she would drop her volume as she spoke, then someone would laugh loudly and I had adjust volume again repeatedly
My tribe Amazing humans, love you all
Life affirming! Thanks to you 3 beautiful humans, my journey through trauma recovery has been filled with so many amazing moments thanks to your wisdom, unwavering kindness, love and truth. May you keep sharing your life’s learnings to help all of us who walk alongside you.
Love to see your faces This podcast has saved my soul and sanity on a constant basis.  I love you all so much.  My one wish would be to have each episode recorded to be able to see your faces more.  Love from Down Under ❤️
Jealousy Just listened to your episode on Jealousy…  I love the absolute truth telling. I have been on a lifelong journey and fascination with human emotions, have worked in child and adolescent development for over two decades, and now 5th year Clinical Psychology student. You teach me more than I have ever learnt through my work and studies through your raw honesty and openness. Thank you!   Again and again your podcast deepens my own reflections and helps me grow.  Angie from Queensland, Australia
Love your work Thank you all for making integrity, vulnerability, honour, humour and compassion part of the podcast vernacular. After every episode I feel I’ve been uplifted and challenged, and like you’ve given me a big warm hug. You articulate honest and unpretentious values and ways of being in the world that make it a better place every day.
Relatable, informative, interesting Before someone gave me Untamed to read in January 2023 I had never heard of Glennon Doyle. That book made me face things I had known and ignored for 10 years. Since then this podcast has continued to broaden my perspective and helped me be brave enough to do so many hard things. Glennon, Abby and Amanda being such unique individuals who are all relatable and vulnerable are such a joy to listen to. This is a very special podcast. I always learn something- regardless of the topic.  Thank you
The most necessary podcast! Ever! I’m not actually sure how I used to do life without this podcast?! It is so damn captivating and every sentence is worth listening to. I have pocketed so many nuggets of gold by tuning in. The wisdom levels are off the charts! 📈 Get involved!
My Best Mates This is an incredible series that’s piecing me back together again. I am immensely grateful. Amanda, Abby and Glennon all bring different insights to the topics with or without experts and guests. I’m entertained, educated, reassured and feel such a loving connection when listening to this podcast.
Perfectly Real I find this podcast so incredibly refreshing, validation and just so damn real. Glennon, Amanda and Abby are just so authentic and their vulnerability is admirable. I feel like I have found my tribe with these women - it is such a relief to know there are other women out there who think and feel just like me. Don’t change a thing!!!
Sally Abed & Alon-Lee Green + WCDHT team  Brilliant Episode Episode 292. What These Palestinian & Israeli Activists Need Us to Know: Standing Together’s Sally Abed & Alon-Lee Green    Thank you for this much needed podcast, we all need to not turn our backs to what the State of Israel is doing to Palestinian people. Sally and Alon-Lee give such honest insights.   Very happy that We Can Do Hard Things is doing just that!
Genuinely changing my life First there was Untamed and then equally as amazing, along came this podcast. Truly life changing stuff - I don’t have the right words to convey the importance of talking and healing out in the open, surrounded by other people, gently doing hard things together. Abby, Amanda and Glennon are changing the whole world 🌎 This pod is my non-negotiable every single week.
My past makes sense I just threw the kids in the pram and powered through Ep. 384. How can 1hr of audio bring answers to questions I’ve had for the better part of a decade! Answers I haven’t been able to find anywhere else. Thank you!!
Love this community Spent this Saturday morning enclosed in my bedroom recovering from burnout, listening to three amazing episodes (with Lindsay C. Gibson), feeling connected to these beloved women across the globe as I make a craft gift for my young person, ate my nourishing breakfast, lay resting in my bed…listening to all our valid inner worlds, hearing and recognising our stories of resilience, growing our maturity and relational skills, self-knowledge and acceptance of ourselves and each other. We are amazing women make space to reflect, heal, and grow stronger together—hard but doable 💝 Tess, Sydney, Australia
Obsessed Can’t do life without We Can Do Hard Things. If you’ve never listened I feel sad for you, but it’s not too late. 😂
Mmm maybe not The tone is a bit preachy. Sister-wives vibe
Regular Look forward to each week’s drop - Glennon -Amanda. & ABBY 🌺😄😂🌹 Much better photo update 😀💖 2024 -wow what a beautiful episode I’m LOVE  Don’t panic I haven’t been paused !🦄🌸🎉💖💖
Not enough stars for this podcast I can relate so deeply to each of these beautiful women at different times. Their willingness and ability to discuss and dive into topics that others shy away from has been literally life changing for me. Along with therapy and many books, they have become the puzzle pieces that are empowering me to become more self reflective and choose me. They have helped me make life feel more manageable, feel less alone and have provided so many prompts for healthy self reflection that I am certain they have played a role in my base level of contentment rising steadily. Thank you from the bottom of my heart ladies. Me, my children and their children will all benefit from your showing up and talking so frankly and being so vulnerable week on week.
My “friends” 😅 Your voices have all become so familiar to me that the other day I was telling my family about something you’d been discussing and I accidentally said “my friends said this thing the other day…” oops! And I have great friends. I just forget sometimes who I’ve spoken to about what. 🙀 Thanks for creating a safe (albeit very public!) space for often deep, usually meaningful, occasionally hilarious conversations about real and hard things. Xx
A Wonderful Show! This is a thought-provoking series of discussions with wonderful guests, covering so many fascinating and life changing topics. I listened to one on 'Guilt' months ago, and I still think about it and ponder what it means for me. And I just listened to some wonderful discussions on fat phobia, forgiveness and what gender really means, which have blown me away.  Thanks so much for your podcast!
We appreciate you guys too Thanks for all the goodness.
Like listening to friends :) Can you speak with Meg Wheatley? She is Friend of Pema Chodron, an Elder and wise woman.
Great content. Always entertaining Love leaning how to take a new perspective on life and love
Love it I really love this podcast, they really keep it real and have so many interesting conversations. I’ve learned so much! Love the theme song too!!!
Such an inspiration Thank you for teaching us how to be authentic and vulnerable! This show helps me with every episode.
Magic insight I could probably write a small novel about the ways in which the special wisdom you each hold intersects in your conversations and has helped reshape my life - but I’ll keep it short! Specifically tonight after a toxic ex reached out - and my impulse was to respond and explain some things - I had Amanda’s voice in my head saying ‘don’t give your enemies ammunition to use against you’ . Thank you all of you, your humour, vulnerability and curiosity means the world 🩷
Thank you! I keep returning, again and again to your real-ness, your wisdom and your open and honest discussions.  Thank you Abby♥️ Thank you Amanda♥️ Thank you Glennon ♥️
Awakening something that has lay quiet for many a season. I have just emerged from listening to episode #245 and I am truly so grateful for having chosen to take the time to listen. Andrea and Megan’s story and the poems that they wrote about each other were undeniably imperfectly perfect. Exactly as they should have been and nothing else would have made such sense, nor delighted the inner senses that sat waiting…knowing…that these two beautiful souls have serendipitous flavour in each moment they exchange. To share such love with another is the ultimate.💕
Transformational Your podcast is my bible, my lifeline. My life is tangibly different because of this podcast. Thank you thank you 💛
More than therapy Your podcast is a gift, a punch and a joy. I can’t quite believe it…
A tall glass of water every day This podcast nourishes my soul. These conversations are so healing and mind opening. So grateful to listen and have this exist in the world. It’s just real and I love it.
the universe provides! Just listened to epsidoe #233  the last of your session so many gold nuggets of insight... thank you so much 🙏🤩
Great Show Loved, loved the episode with Kelly Clarkson.
Sense of calm from that first strum of the guitar Can’t explain it but from that first guitar strum I feel I have walked into a room of loving friends.   And… Go the Matilda’s!!!  Love you Abby you are my fave x
Glennon 🤩 Feeling you Glennon ❤️ You are me. From as early as I can remember I’ve always felt there was something inherently wrong with me. After listening to this, tears streaming down my face, I know Im a 4. And it feels good to know I'm not alone. Thank you thank you thank you 🙏🏼
Embodiment in a podcast So much healing in this pod. Healing my relationship with my body and becoming more embodied thanks to their chatter every episode!
Always always just what I need I drive for hrs every weekend for my job and I look forward to it so much as I know who I’ll have in the car with me. Your podcasts make me laugh so much. They make me cry so much.  They make me so wise and I feel like the relatable content, makes me feel like a functional woman in the world.  Thanks for all of You for being You
Love, Love, Love this podcast!! Love listening to G,A & A they bring me joy every day and make me laugh out loud - Thankyou x
My favourite podcast 🫶 Thank you beautiful people for lifting my soul and letting me see more of myself in our shared experiences. I learn so much about life and deepen my connection to myself and the world and heal a little more every time I join with you in conversation with your incredible guests. Thank you for reminding me We can do hard things (together) 🙏
My go -to podcast 🙏❤️ This is my number one favourite podcast. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for sharing your light, darkness and everything that encompasses the very messy middle. I love listening, laughing, nodding, agreeing, smiling and crying along with you. Your combined strength, empathy, warmth, humour, compassion and humanity is refreshing and heart felt. If I could give you six stars I would. Loving you from Australia. Totally recommended. This won’t disappoint. ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Best podcast EVER! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Glennon, Abby and Amanda. This podcast is everything. I feel I am becoming a better human with each new episode.
Best Podcast 🥇 Truely one of the best podcasts out there in the universe. I can’t specify just one episode, all insightful, deep dive, authentic and entertaining.Start from the beginning and work your way through. AMAZING Listening from half way around the world, Cat Australia 🇦🇺🏳️‍🌈
Humour, wisdom and research Glennon, Abbey and Amanda are gold. Great chemistry and different perspectives packed with wisdom, humour and insight.
So damn real These podcasts are just so good. The deep sharing, the vulnerability, the wisdom. Not to mention badass humour. I get sooo excited when I see there is a new episode in! I have felted helped, supported, seen, informed & delighted. Thanks to the 3 of you treasures. You are really doing a beautiful thing for the growing podsquad community. Carry on. 💖🙏🏼💖🙏🏼💖🙏🏼
CW E215 I love you guys and this podcast has helped me so much. Can I please ask you to add “cancer” to the CW for episode 215. I have just done my 3-monthly CT scan, haven’t received the results yet, and I really didn’t see it coming from the title and description of the episode. I’ve only listened to the first 5-10min and I’m sure that it is a beautiful and very brave and deep episode AND it was not the right time for me to listen to it. Thank you.
Favourite Go To podcast. Always always great episodes. They’re hilarious in their honest rawness and courageous vulnerability as much as it makes them squirm. I squirm , learn and laugh with them. Fabulous guests!!! I love you amazing women!! 💗💗💗 Carol  Australia 🇦🇺
Love this team. Just validating, clarifying, relatable stuff. Love it.
Listening from Sydney Australia What can I say so connect on so many levels. Love the sense of humour, openness and honesty that you share. I’m sure you have been told that you need to come to the land down under Sydney Australia.
Adore this podcast I just adore this podcast. Glennon, Abby and Sister each add a unique view on the topics they discuss and I love how real they are. Brilliant guests too. Please don’t stop putting these episodes out into the world!
Helping me be a better human Glennon, Abby and Amanda plus their amazing guests make me want to do better and be better!!
My favourite podcast in the whole world Glennon, Abby and Sister (Amanda) are my favourite most nourishing people. Thank you for putting this out into the world. It makes navigating this place a little bit easier. Love you all !!!
Reaffirms my faith in humanity every time Beautiful, funny and illuminating. I adore this podcast. The episode ‘Abby’s Christmas Miracle’ moved me so very deeply. Brilliant stuff.
Validating my humanity! Could not relate more to people I’ve never even met yet feel so much resonance with. Thank you for being real and saying and feeling all the things.
Real life humaning at its finest I don’t think I’ve ever loved a podcast more. There is just so much to love about these 3 wonderful women, the connection they share & their commitment to delving into the grimy underbelly of the human experience. Conversations about living - the beauty, awe, heartache & suffering we all share, delivered with so much realness & tenderness. I’m constantly laughing, reflecting & questioning myself & the world around me further with each new episode. It’s such a gift & I’m so grateful I came across it.
I can do hard things I first got to know Glennon from her book “Untamed”. I read the book in peak of pandemic with my peers in our Zoom Bookclub. It touched my soul to walk through her story with her. Although I am from a completely different background but every bits of the book felt relatable. I listened to Glennon and Abbey’s interviews on different podcast tillll I saw this podcast was launched. So from episode one to the last one, I never missed an episode. I live with you alllll, you are my soul sisters and I walk through life feeling you are lightening the way for me. I feel I know you and I am so grateful for you. When life gets hard or I am escadied, I know that I can do the hard things.  Thank you Abbey, Amanda and Glennon for what you are doing. P.S. how can I call you to leave a message? I live in Australia. P.P.S. Amanda (The Sister) - you are sister to all of us!
Always relevant It seems every time I listen to an episode on “We Can Do Hard Things” it is like somebody there has telepathically downloaded my journal, my poetry, my waking thoughts. Thank you. It is my regular show I listen to on my morning walk and I feel deprived if I don’t get to listen to one if I am out of routine. You are loved.
Pretty perfect podcast From the beautiful theme song through to the honest, fun and brilliant literacy skills of all the presenters and the guests,  this is a podcast I cherish. It never disappoints.
Life changing! I have been listening since day 1. Every episode is my favourite. I’m a proud pod squander! This pod cast has seen me some of the toughest times in my life. I have grown with you as y’all have grown too! Hi from Australia.
Best. Pod. Ever!!! WCDHT is my all time favourite pod🧡💖 I am so grateful for the honesty with which Glennon, Abby & Amanda (plus fab guests 🙌🏻) discuss topics that speak right to the heart of being human in 2023! LOVE 💖 LOVE💖 LOVE💖
I look forward to every episode! I so love love love this podcast! I can’t decide if I am team Glennon, Abby or Amanda so I am not going to. I am team all!!  Love all the episodes. Even when I look at the title and think (as a listener who isn’t American), maybe I won’t like or get this one, then I listen and love the ep and get something out of each one.  Such strong women; such warriors; such leaders. Xxxx
We can do hard things in a fun loving way! Oh man what to say about this podcast… I love how frequently they give us new episodes! I’ve always got a new one to listen to on my drive to Work, drive home, a slow moment at work, to play while I paint. They have a variety of beautiful guests sharing deep personal insights on big hard topics, but like in a light and fun way some how… I love this community x Thank you powerful people!
Straight from the heart I’ve listened to a gazillion podcasts and this is the first time I’ve been moved so much that I had to leave a review. The story of the kids asking Abby to adopt them is one of the most beautiful things I have listened to. Just know, that the three of you are giving those of us who feel unloved, unknown and unheard, a happy place. You are amazing women, thank you!!
Love the personal episodes I love this podcast, it's so wholesome and helps me feel less existentially marooned!   I especially love the episodes where Amanda and more recently Abi, have shared their personal journeys. How lucky we are to hear such raw vulnerability.   I also value Glennon letting us in to her world to understand how her eating disorder has affected her life. You are so incredibly brave.   Thank you for sharing so openly with us.
My all time fave Love everything about this podcast. Makes me laugh, cry and feel EVERY time. Thankyou
Gave me a new sense of calm and connection Thank you gals. I recently stumbled across a snippet of your chat with Sarah Paulson. I’m a screenwriter and creative producer so that’s what first attracted me to the podcast…you discussed how she came to be cast (as Glennon), and what her process is etc. I’m Australian so next listened to Hannah Gatsby, and I have since binged many of your podcasts.  BUT I stayed because I’m a  woman. I find myself relating to something discussed in every single episode.  I somehow feel connected to you and your community and I thank you for that.  PS I also laugh at inappropriate times, and I cry when I’m angry…I can’t control it, but it’s authentic, it’s me, and I’m okay with that.
Balm for my weary soul! You have created one of my most loved podcasts.   WCDHT is truly a balm for my weary soul.   A big thank you to all three of you for the way you show up, speak your truth, and model what it is to be a lifelong learner.   Here’s to continuing to grow, evolve, and show up more fully as who we are and who we are becoming.
My Lovecast Time spent with Abby, Amanda and Glennon on a Tuesday, Thursday and Friday (in Australia) is my time to spend with myself and three people who I relate to. My sister and I then spend time every week debriefing our own thoughts and experiences of the ‘hard thing’ for that week. My life expands because of you. I often spend time understanding an issue or reading a guest’s book or writings. I love We Can Do Hard Things - it’s a weekly reminder of our common humanity.
Keep going! My life is richer and my cup overflows with joy in the sheer fact I get to immerse myself in these wise, gracious, awe inspiring conversations. As Abby said to her guest Sarah, ‘keep going!!’  I’ll be here for it. Love you all.
I am so grateful for these women! I have followed the journey of G & A since i first visualized A walking through the door at that book tour…. I really enjoy not only their insights but their powerfully female insights.
Awesome Love this podcast. You 3 have become my new best friends 💖💖💖💖
Brilliance Love this podcast and content x
Game changing I have listened to this podcast since the very first episode and it has opened my mind, my heart, and my conversations, to talk about hard things and to laugh and cry and think deeply and rethink. Thank you Glennon, Amanda and Abby for being so honest and thoughtful and intentional in how you present all the topics, I recommend this podcast to everyone I know
Inspirational, thought provoking, wise This podcast has got me through one of the hardest years of my life. My husband left me and the farm after drought, fires, floods and I have had to learn to do really hard things alone 👩‍🌾  So this has become my mantra. Every time I have to do something difficult or that I don't know how to do, I tell myself 'we can do hard things'. And it's true, we can. I can! 💪🏻  Thank you from the deep well of my heart 💖🙏🏻
Sensible guiding light to a  more truthful Me I look forward to each episode, I love the dynamic, the conversations and the thoughts that are shared. Some times challenging sometimes joyful, lots of laughs and always rewarding.  Do something nice for yourself and try this podcast.
Always delivers Always gives me new insights. Smart and supportive and brave.
Moved I don’t know how I only just discovered these angels but this podcast gets me on creative flow, listening while making my art. Each bring their own unique but equally beautiful energy to this platform. So inspired, so grateful. I feel like they are friends of mine 😭☺️
My ritual and relief. Grateful. I love this podcast. It has become a talisman!  I cannot count how many times the topics discussed have been the exact support for what I am currently challenged with.   Thankyou 💕
Thank you Cannot thank you all enough for the joy, sadness and realness that this podcast brings to my life. The sense of sharing the load of my life is at times the life raft I need. ❤️
The best podcast ever! Funny. Authentic. Deep. Light-hearted. Cheerful. Nurturing. People-loving. Totally awesome! (More women with disabilities please Glennon!) I love this podcast to the moon and back!
Thank you from Aus Thank you beautiful ladies for your intelligence, vulnerability and humour and for shepherding me through a lonely and difficult time and allowing me to feel less alone and ‘crazy’.
Re Episode 128 Glennon lost her mind Firstly I just pressed the button on a review I did’ I don’t know how long ago, or even what I said! 🙄😬 I thought it ‘sent’. Apology🙏🏻. Just listened to Ep.128 & Thank Y’all G-A & A !! Love you for taking the time to brain storm these subjects! So Yes, I totally relate!✅❤️ Yes, you’re absolutely helping✅❤️ (I can only speak for myself) to ‘BE-come’ a better person to my daughters,💕 to my 4 grand daughters💝 (&2 grand sons💙💙) And my loving husband 😇 who on a regular basis does my head in cause he’s very much the typical un-evolved male.. YOU THREE MUSKETEERS are helping me to deal with my life on a daily basis. Whilst I’m cooking, creating my Encaustic Art, Driving long distances from Yamba to Sydney etc.etc. You’re my SoulSisters!! Sending you in turn wellness & peace, stay safe & Sane. I’ll be listening, Love Jolanda xx 😘. By the way, Glennon, Amanda, Abbey. DONT EVER STOP!!

My favourite pod cast This is my all time favourite podcast.  Must listen for everyone who wants to make the world a more empowering, open, loving and kinder experience for all -  while meeting kindred souls and laughing along this wild journey of life 💕😀🌈
Exceptional Podcast! listening the podcast from Australia!!! 🇦🇺 ive been listening to the pod for a long time now but just havent had a chance to write a review, always end up having a good day everytime i listened to them! have helped me changed my perspectives in life. Always looking forward to listening it every week ;)
Thanks to the Transformative Trio Hi there to the Transformative Trio with love  from Australia,   I discovered your podcast after reading your book Untamed recently Glennon and I was hooked. I have named you, Abby and Amanda the Transformative Trio because you make me belly laugh with your anecdotal stories, you challenge me to try hard things by the way you share what you, guests and other Pod Stars like me are working on and you encourage me to try and be a better version of myself daily.   I am indebted to you for reintroducing me to the Indigo Girls and for showing up each week and sharing your lives with ordinary women like me. Thank you for making me finally realise that it’s ok to be introverted and not to feel guilty about not being enough. You are doing hard work for women. Please come visit all your Pod Stars  down under someday. X  V
The episode that wasn’t an episode - such an important conversation I initially shyed away from this episode but so glad I listened to it. Such an important mirror to hold up to reflect and discuss behaviour we’ve been conditioned to not even question.  I didn’t even relate to this until you broke it down and spelt it out.   Thank you also Sissy/Amanda for your openness and courage in being willing to share when you’ve been on the other side - as we all inevitably have been, given we are human.  Such a valuable discussion.  Great work 🙌🏻 and thank you 😍
Best episode of an f’ing awesome podcast Thank you all of you for living your values and yesterday authentically having the backs of your team. Needed this episode right now with work experiences where leadership has just discovered that they need to be seen to treat staff with respect and listen to them while continuing the behaviours of gaslighting, suppressing and targeting the people who genuinely live their values and try to call the bad out. All three of you guys truly rock - but, being like Glennon and wanting to torch all the land when someone is mistreated, I learn a lot from Amanda’s rational, calm and hugely effective way of standing up for what’s right! You three are truly good humans - thank you for being you.
LOVE I love this podcast so much. It has genuinely had a very positive impact on my life. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for your raw authenticity, your feminist strength, all the exquisite words you string so eloquently, cleverly thoughtfully together, and of course, for all the laughs!
A life line Your podcast is a beautiful life line for me at present. I lay in bed once my son is asleep and everything that needs doing is done and listen to you three. Thank you. Your voices, conversations, humour and honesty soothes my soul, my core.
My first thought was these ladies are too much! My first thought was these ladies are too much! But in fact these ladies are actually everything! Honestly, thoughtfulness, kindness. So many things & all without for a second pretending that they have a single thing worked out.
Feels like home Without hyperbole - this podcast and Untamed has been truly formative.  A touchstone in my life.
The BEST! Omg I laughed when I saw that this podcast is rated ‘clean’ 😆 love the potty mouths. So freakin real. Love all of it. The most recent parenting one with Dr Becky is just life-affirming. Keep speaking your truths beautiful women!!!! Xx
Every Episode Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Glennon & Abbey & Amanda…and to all the other wonderful humans who join in on the conversations…I love, love, love tuning in to you guys, no matter the topic and feel so deeply understood…on so many levels and I don’t even have to speak. Namaste soul sisters! ❤️💛♥️
Love love!! I adore this podcast. I have to commute  interstate here in Australia and I listen to episodes whilst commuting. The “most embarrassing moments” podcast had me pissing myself laughing in the car on the way home last week and I’m sure other drivers thought I was complete lunatic. I admire you all so much, you simply make my day. Much love Mandy from Australia ❤️❤️
Love you Glennon, Abby and Sis! My name is Josie and I’m from Sydney,Australia. I’ve been listening to you guys since it all began, after I read your amazing book, Glennon. I can’t even tell you….you fill this greedy heart with more joy than it can take. Abby and Glennon, the way you love each other has me smile from cheek to eye. Especially Abby, I can hear the way you look at her when you talk. 😍I honestly don’t have any more words, just good juju.   I came here to write this review and to say how much I felt your sentiment in your personality episode. I have adhd and the way you spoke of your wondering around… “My sometimes…what would be perceived as spaciness, getting lost all the time… in the car, or just like wondering into rooms and not knowing why I’m there…or leaving my coffee mug in the dryer … or finding my phone in the refrigerator… I think that’s all tied to introversion/extroversion”  I didn’t think of it as a way of experiencing interior and exterior worlds. I’d like to complement this with what I know about my brain. I forget things because I have a short attention span and my working memory isn’t great. The spaciness is because yes, I’m daydreaming, but also because my default mode network sets in (see Ned Hallowell) and because my senses get overwhelmed (I’m sensi-tive)and thus I tend to forget things… but yeah… it’s a nice poetic way, how you talked about introversion and extroversion to describe some features of adhd.   Anyway, I hope you finds you guys somehow! I love love lovelovkekvovofkfksksjcjfksk LOVE your pod.   See you next ep!

Weekly dose of reality mixed with hope Mum of 2, full on career, game changer for me was to get up at 6am on Saturday morning and go to the organic markets where I can set myself up nicely for the week. The motivation for me to go consistently was knowing that I’ll jump in the car and listen to your podcast on the way to and from the markets. That has been my motivation and total game changer in 2022. I laugh, I cry, I find inspiration and use it as fuel for the week ahead. Thank you!
Favourite podcast I listen to these podcasts twice as I can’t get enough of them. Every time I think ‘that was the best episode ever’, the next one is even better! Pure podcast magic. We’re so blessed to have them.
Meds 👌👌 Hey G! I love, love, love this as I knew I would! I have to tell you that you helped me live my truth and finally ask for help and get medicine for anxiety!! And, the crazy thing is my GP prescribed Lexapro! The way you described the way it helps you live a “normal” life is exactly how it helps me! Lots of love from Wagga Wagga , Australia. 😘😘
Life changing Listening to this podcast has given me a community and made me realise I am not alone in the hard things. It has been transformative and I am forever grateful. Always a believer, listener, creator and fan. Thank you Glennon, Amanda and Abbey
Love You all make me laugh cry feel think and be more of myself . Thank you for being so yourselves ❤️
Chelsea H I’ve listened to this episode with Chelsea several times. It totally hit the spot for exactly where I am at on my journey. I finally “got” the lesson around abandoning myself. It’s never too late to get the lesson you have been circling / avoiding for so long.  So grateful to have this drop at the perfect time.  Chelsea is so brave and raw. ❤️
A long time coming An honest, fem-centric and brave podcast, the likes of which we’ve been waiting for, for a long time. Thank you Abby, Glennon, Amanda and many guests for your continued dedication to getting untamed. We’ve got a long way to go but with sisters and community by our side, we’re never alone.
Brilliant podcasts for the MIND, heart & soul LOVE listening to you all and heartfelt appreciation for your raw honesty. These podcasts are my ‘me’ time! Highly recommend.
Simply the BEST I’m late to the party and have really made up for it by binging every episode over the last month. Some I’ve listened to several times. The dynamics of Sister, Abby & Glennon on this pod is divine. The way they interact with guests is phenomenal. I have grown so much as a person and I’m completely and utterly in love with all of you. You are MY people. Thank you so so very much from an Australian human. I just have to mention two of my favourite little asides - firstly that you have a daughter who held up a sign the said ‘I am Abby Wambach’s daughter’ is absolute solid gold and brings me so so much joy. Secondly Glennon not really wanting to mention that she blew dried her fake plant. I laugh about you all laughing so often. Just beautiful!!!
My soft place to land Dearest G, Abby and Sister, Your podcast is my soft place to land, twice, every week. What a gift this podcast is to the world. Literally.  Like many, I truly believe WCDHT should be required listening for all humans.  Best podcast EVER. I look forward to each week’s episodes so damn much. Even when life is hard, when life gets lifey, I know at least I have you all (and all the likeminded podsquaders) to cozy up and listen to, cry with, laugh with, learn from.
The only podcast I need!! This podcast is my twice a week group therapy session. These are the only conversations I want to have - deep, meaningful, thought provoking. This pod gives you all the feels. Thank you for the exceptional work you ladies do. The world is better because of it.
Real talk real issues This podcast uplifts, informs and brings people together around real issues that need talking about in this crazy world we live in today. Sometimes I have no idea how to put into words my dismay and anger at the way the world is unfolding today…the women on this podcast provide balance and reality. They shed light real facts and history on world events affecting us all.  I feel able to enter discussions confidently with a view which is sound in fact and logic.  Thank you for giving this to the world Glennon Abbey and Amanda.
Obsessed I spent the weekend packing my house and listening to GD, Abby, Sister, Liz Gilbert and Brene, and loved every moment. You know when you love an episode SO MUCH that you feel compelled to share it with a bestie or someone you adore. That good. All the time. Thank you.
Just wonderful I look forward to podcasts from Glennon, Abby and Amanda. I feel at home when I listen to them. So much love, truth and honesty while possibly challenging how you think about life. Wonderful
Beautiful, honest and everything you need it to be I couldn’t love this podcast more. I’ve loved Glennon since reading Untamed during early Covid, and couldn’t get enough of her after that. She, Abby (❤️) and Amanda (👏🏻) get straight to the heart of what really freaking matters in life and DISCUSS IT, boldly, honestly and hilariously. Plus, holy cow Glennon can turn a phrase - it’s like she’s putting so eloquently the scribble in my own head, and she’s a gift to us all - I’m so very grateful. The guests are wonderful but the discussions from these women are what I come for. Thank you. X
Very moving Brave and courageous discussions about some of the hardest issues that we experience in the lives of women. Thank you.
Hello from Australia Hello from Australia 🇦🇺 Just listening To Elizabeth Gilbert. ⭐️Oh Thankyou 🥰🥺 for everything you do!
Lovely inspiring podcast ❤️ Thank you
Numbers Love your work but I won’t be defined by a number nor should you! Enneagram and all other personality tests have significant weaknesses not least is …. our individuality!
Hypervigilance When y’all work out how to resolve a lifetime of hypervigilance, please call me. One of your best eps *for me*. Raised by a parent with BPD and later another serious psychiatric overlay (now passed) basically due to a lifetime of trauma; needing to co-parent a younger sibling; a sister with a serious mental health overlay; no Dad and not much support. Ever. What you do after a lifetime of hypervigilance? You get a career where it is absolutely essential for success 😂 No wonder I’m exhausted. With love from Melbourne, Australia.
Straight to the brain via the heart I love the diversity of your personalities. I love the courage you bring with your honesty. I love the qualified intellect of your discussions. I love how you stand proudly in your truth. You make me laugh. You make me cry. You make me ponder. You make me better. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yes! Finally a podcast with real people who tell me the truth about life Thank you especially for Glennon’s retelling of the Christmas story I have saved it and replayed it multiple times already
Hannah gadsby Hannah was fantastic. Incredibly intelligent and introspective. I was very disappointed with the superficial questions you asked her. One question should have been how does her autism inform her comedy before she was diagnosed. And why do you use such a child-like voice. I find it disturbing. Claire Jackson previous president of the melbourne queer film festival.
Great teaching I like you girls…. I learn from you and your guests every time I hear a podcast and I listen several times to soak it up. 👏👏👏
Wise & kind & deeply helpful These are truthtellers, wise women navigating real lives and sharing how they do it. Brilliant, soulful & deeply helpful.
Top notch podcast I love this show, the guests are incredible. The amazing insights, the thoughts, ideas, strategies. How I can do the hard things in my life has become that little bit easier since listening to this show. Glennon, Amanda, Abbey you are all awesome humans - thankyou.
You’ve brightened my days! Glennon, Abby and Sister… thank you! You have brightened my mornings more than you will ever know. Chronic illness has taken over my life and ‘We can do hard things’ speaks to me in every way! You guys are a blessing! Your podcast makes me laugh, cry and everything in between. I’m learning things about myself that I didn’t know were possible. Love you all!!!
Thank you I love love love this podcast! After Reading Glennon’s book Untamed (well listening to it on audible), I fell in love & felt at home with her message of being a “god damn cheetah”.  WE CAN DO HARD THINGS 💞 I love listening to Sister, Glennon & Abbie nut things out.  Thank you thank you thank you ❤️🌸
LOVE I adore this podcast and Glennon, Abby and Amanda. I relate to each of you in different ways and love hearing you explore life and the various ways we experience and interpret it. I appreciate so much you giving each other the space to talk and consider topics and opinions. Thank you even though I often find myself crying in supermarkets and on walks!!!
Just the best! My favourite podcast ❤️
Love Listening from sunny Sydney Australia. This is my favourite podcast because I feel so seen by it as a thoughtful woman in this crazy world. I feel like you cover topics that I am thinking about already. I love all three of you and the different styles that you bring- each of you certainly has your ‘own magic’! Would love you to do an episode on perfectionism - we do we do it?! And how do we undo it?! More discussions on boundaries would be great too. Love you!!
A companion to walk alongside as you face the hard things I love this podcast, it grounds me in a sense of shared humanity and purpose in a way that changes how I show up. Thank you. PS I just worked out how to leave a review-thanks to the pod squadder who asked 🙏🏼
Ruthie D Absolutely love this podcast. Glennon, Abby and Sister- your discussions have made such a difference in my life. As the mother of 2 boys ( one who is disabled) this podcast is one of the highlights of my week. Thank you thank you.
Ms Josephine Martin Excellent - these women have literally become my psychic and emotional best friends. Warm, honest, raw and so so funny. They’ve helped me thrown out (burn!) the map provided by society/family of origin etc and learn to feel and trust my inner compass. Can’t recommend it highly enough.
Such joy each week It’s hard to put into a small number of words how wonderful these podcasts are.  Glennon, Abby and Sister are just a wonderful combination of humans who speak with such love and empathy. They make my week better, they make me a better human, parent and partner and less alone.
On Episode 50.. This is how you find yourself Wow.. this really shook my inner world (which gets so much more air time than the outer). Can I just go straight to the journal? I’ll read the fabulous book when my energy returns. 🙏🏼🌟
Love this podcast and song Tish’s song is so beautiful! I love the honesty and openness of the conversations. The holidays episode has very useful takeaways for maintaining our integrity during family events. Thanks for sharing your insight and wisdom ♥️
The best podcast ever made! 100% the best podcast ever!! These conversations are incredibly important to everyone, especially women as well as anyone who feels “other”. I couldn’t love this podcast & these three amazing women more if I tried, so grateful!
Thank you Thank you so much for all your work. It inspires me everyday. I absolutely loved the Tarana Burke episodes and have bought the book. What a woman!
Always the right kind of hard Glennon, Amanda and Abby,   This podcast has been everything I didn’t even know I needed. Your raw honesty and incredible way of just putting your finger on everything at the core of the stuff that erodes our joy, in such a beautiful and transformative way. It’s everything.  Thank you ❤️
Just amazing Such an awesome podcast. I laugh and cry almost every episode. So much truth and joy and support and care. I love you all so much. Thank you for putting this content out into our world. X
The best conversations my mind has ever been apart of Everything, from the content to the format, so excellent. so inspired. putting words around the feels I have had and more, allowing me access to other people's mind conversations. it is warm, funny, real and relevant.  thank you Glennon, Sister and Abby
Love The Show I’m one of your anxious bunnies and I absolutely love your show. Your first podcast about anxiety came at a time in my life when I really needed to hear it. You’re an inspiration, thank you for reminding us that we can do hard things.
Offical Ted Lasso fan Hi gals,  Love your pod Love your brains & the way they work Thanks for speaking y(our) truth & creating a space to think & learn & grow & reflect & breathe And love your writing Glennon 11/10 Also thought I’d mention that my work team (a public library in Sydney, Aus) now watches an ep of Ted Lasso each day and I’m addicted. I didn’t think it could be as good as you make it out to be but somehow it’s better!!!! We have Ted screenings tues-thurs, and mon/fri are for catch up episodes in case anyone missed out. We take it VERY seriously which is important.  Thanks for talking about Ted & everything else  Love Rosie  P.s. my niece Lola is 5 & responds to anything vaguely hard/inconvenient with “yeah, we can do hard things?” so nonchalantly and I love it so THANK YOU! The other day after putting her shoes on the WRONG feet she looked up at me and said it because #cheetah
Favourite podcast I love this podcast. It’s my favourite I love how passionate and authentic everyone is just keeping it real. My kind of people. 💜 Also funny too. Great topics every week.
Existing until the next episode. This podcast is getting me through lockdown. It’s a relief to feel like I having adult conversation (even though I’m not talking) that’s not with the only other adult in my house- my husband. I appreciate all the ideas and thoughts shared that cause me to self reflect and investigate my own internal dialogue. Amazing amazing podcast. Thank you G, A and A.
Nodding along always Amazing conversations & so relatable, thank you so much for an incredible podcast. Loved your book & your work x
Fun fun fun Just started listening to this podcast and today was episode 4 on Fun…so good and best ever was your playlist which I put on straight after, listening and singing along ( to the ones I knew) whilst gardening and then headed out for a walk as sun was setting with an extra spring in my step and then back home with dancing in the kitchen as I prepped dinner. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Sister for becoming part of my days. Love from lockdown Sydney 🧡
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! Glennon, sister, Abby, thank you for giving us the assurance that what we experience as women is normal, and that it is okay to feel overwhelmed, uncertain and exhausted as we live our lives!! You have given me permission to just be me, and the understanding to accept that I don’t need to be anyone else! Tish- your song made me cry with healing! Thank you all. Please keep doing your hard things
When listening feels like being with your family I love this podcast. The topics are so relatable and I feel like I’m at home with my sisters listening and often joining in with a “Yup” or a giggle to myself. Thank you for the work you do Glennon, Sister & Abbey. You’re truly amazing. Tish, thanks for inspiring me to pick up my guitar and sing again. You’re wonderful. From Bex Good Foodie
Comforting I love this podcast so much. They talk about real things from such a raw place but hold the space and normalise the feelings that go with hard things. They make me want to be brave, and make me feel understood and safe. Thanks gorgeous girls.
Amazing and life changing! This podcast is seriously one of the best that I have listened to. I love the real, raw and honest conversations that take place. There is no judging. Just love.  Glendon’s mantra “we can do hard things” is something that I say all the time when I face challenges. It gives me strength.  Love love love this!!
No ‘Woo woo’s’ Gut level honest conversations. No ‘Woo Woo’ Do this or Do that just Truth, lived life experiences and genuine support.  Love it!!
Love this pod Such honest and brave conversations
life changing I’m a recovering alcoholic at 38. Glennon says and writes what I can’t seem to say 💓 thank you
Soul food I have loved Glennon since I stumbled across her feed when my mum was dying. She speaks to my soul. This podcast is everything, Amanda is so much like Glennon, it’s like double the soul food. I miss my mumma’s wisdom - thank you so much for sharing yours ❤️❤️❤️
It feels like home I just love what are you doing here. I am amazed how you can divide complex problems into small portions, explain them and than just make them easier and possible to live with. Thank you so much for being here for us, for carrying.
Chapter 1 anxiety segment This morning I’ve listened to this wonderful podcast about anxiety. As a fellow anxiety person in this world I thank you for not making me feel alone anymore.  Your soothing words of comfort support and encouragement blew my mind I look forward listening to the rest of your podcast. Much love from Perth, Western Australia
*loveloveLOVE!* I could not love this podcast more! Every episode I find myself nodding along, getting goosebumps….  It feels like you’re part of a conversation with your best friends.  Glennon, Sister, and Abby pull no punches..they speak with honesty and from the heart.  ❤️
More please Thank you for taking the plunge and creating something so real, and away from the vacuousness of celebrity status. I’ve read Untamed three times now, and I keep getting new insights every time - thank you! I loved the podcast, but what brought me to my knees was listening to your daughter’s song... I was driving to work and holding back the tears. Congratulations on raising her! Is there a transcript we could possibly access after the show?
Love these ladies! I love these ladies. They talk straight to my soul. I have always felt like I was drowning in my thoughts and feelings, I worked so hard to hide the real me because I was too much for the world. That’s changing now and it feels so freeing (and scary) 😊 thank you Glennon, Amanda and Abby for doing hard things.
Profound Every episode resonates deeply with me. Thank you for sharing your wisdom ❤️
#7 Podcast better than therapy I started listening to you today for the first time. We are in Covid lockdown 3.0 right now in Sydney and I just want you to know that listening to you has been life changing for me. I got more out of your No. 7 podcast than in one therapy session! Your partnership is a carbon copy of mine and my husband. Its comforting to know I’m not alone with these same experiences. Thank you Thank you THANK YOU so much for opening up and sharing. 🤩🤩🤩😘😘😘
The first podcast I’ve listened too I read untamed - the first audio book I’ve read, and so it was fitting that this was the first podcast I listened too. This is real stuff, I always get something out of each episode, it’s truly amazing. Thank you Glennon, Sister and Abby. And also Tish for a beautiful song - I’m going to see if that is on Spotify. If it’s not, it should be. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Loving this - and you! Oh wow - Glennon, Sis and Abby rock!!
Untamed & unraveling 🌈🙏🏾🌟💗 Thank you Glennon, Abbey & sister, for your honesty & vulnerability 🌟🌟🌟 for allowing yourselves to be seen & heard so publicly 🙏🏾 you are incredibly courageous. I learnt of Glennon via Brene Browns unlocking us.... and now I’m addicted. I have just listened too the episode on queer freedom, ugh 😑 homophobia is still so rampant. Thank you for navigating these complex topics with so much grace. I share your teachings with the world via social media & with all my dear ones, during courageous conversations, again thank you 🙏🏾 & amen 🌟
Life changing Since listening to your podcast and reading untamed I have found myself saying to myself “we can do hard things”.  This podcast is truly inspirational. THANK YOU
Real with a sprinkle of humour I loved untamed and was excited to see this podcast come to life. It has not disappointed. So many challenging topics discussed with vulnerability, openness, zero judgement and a genuine care and love for each other and listeners. The humour woven in has had me laughing out loud which for such serious and meaningful topics amazes me but resonates. Thank you. I eagerly await each new episode xx
Thank you! Glennon, Amanda and Abby thank you so much for all of the ways you bring some much of yourselves, your truth and a voice to all of these topics xx I get goosebumps, I laugh, I cry, each week , because you have a way to get into the corners and little spaces within us that these hard things can sometimes live and bring them forward and free… I feel like my insides get a hug. I refresh my podcast app every Wednesday until the next episode comes up! So much love to you
Love this podcast So refreshingly real. Lots of relatable, human, authentic gems of wisdom
Like listening to conversations with the friend you wish you had Wow! I just can’t say enough good stuff about this podcast. I love Glennon but her sister brings another dimension of her to the forefront. Women talking about real struggles in an open hearted, wise, insightful manner. No bs, no fluff, just honest, sometimes deeply personal but always valuable reflections and deep conversations. I wait for the next episode every week! Listen to this and maybe change the world just a little for the better!
Overwhelm Episode I have just shared the latest episode about Overwhelm on my personal Facebook page. As a fierce lover of sharing info that help women be better versions of themselves, I know so many women will relate to this episode as I did! Thank you for your amazing work! I love your podcast Glennon and sis xx
Pure bliss Absolutely loved listening in. Laughs, tears and tonnes of ‘a huh’ and ‘YES’ moments. I don’t feel so alone. Thankyou xo
Like a deep conversation with your best friend This podcast helps me, another sensitive emotionally overturned person to rumble through and work out my thoughts when I’m at home working alone. I simply love Glennon et al. 5 stars and a warm hug.
Love this podcast I was so excited when this podcast came out and it hasn’t let me down. I look forward to listening every week.
What do I think is Fun? Crickets... Related to both G & Sister equally & appreciated Abby’s explanation so much! Include Abby more! The 3 of you are definitely the best Podcast combo! I didn’t need anything else FUN this weekend, HA!
Brilliant singers Loving your podcast. It’s spot on! I really wanted to commend the gorgeous song at the end & the stunning harmonising voices …..just beautiful!
More dull than a dentist visit Had to stop at about 15 mins in, conversation was boring, and names they refer to each other is sickly, Honey and Sister. Felt like listening to a cult. Ugh.
Fun & Suffering Brilliant - funny, poignant, deep and educational. I love the perspectives, intelligence and openness this sensational podcast brings to my week. Thank you all. 🙏🏼💜🙋🏼‍♀️
Essential listening! As a vehement non-reviewer of all the things, I felt compelled to do so after listening to today’s episode! Each week you and Sister outdo yourselves, teasing out and distilling the nuances of some of life’s really hard things. So, thank you! What a powerhouse episode today’s was, and what a beautiful dynamic between the three of you. It made me so happy knowing that such a thing exists! Hopefully Abby will be a regular guest? Thoroughly enjoyed all of your insights and observations. Keep it up!
Best people are free. The best podcast, the best hosts. I love you all. And my pain feel lighter.
Highly rate! I love listening to the conversations between These 2sisters and their guests. Great topics. Beautiful people 💕
Love the episode on boundaries You articulate the points so well G. I can relate to your sensitivity, empathy and I love how you own it unashamedly. Also great tips on honouring self over disempowering dynamics from conditioning. Keep up great work xox
Amazing LOVE this podcast so much - my favourite part is Tish’s song at the end, beautiful lyrics, a stunning voice and such a perfect way to end the show ❤️❤️ love from Australia 🇦🇺P.S. Please, please, please release the song 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
When is Tish’s song being released?! As ever beautiful, open, vulnerable and real. I’m all in.
I love finding out more about myself each week An absolutely fantastic insight into the choices we make and the hard things we face in life. I look forward every week to a new episode. And am so in love with Tish’s own song at the end. I’ve listened to it so many times now.
Soul savers! You’re my people! My soul savers… I’ve been abused and under submission + control my entire life! I’m the biggest people pleaser I know, I just want to help everyone constantly, yet I’m not pleased with who I am at all… I’m always worrying what others will think of my actions, I feel like a Gecko Im that good at adapting to my surroundings just to please others! Yet I struggle with pleasing me daily, I struggle to except the help I’m always happy to give! I’m often told I’m all sorts of amazing, yet I struggle to believe it, I think if only you knew all my truths, then you’d disagree. BUT sisters… Thanks to my faith, some real friends, Untamed, Glennon, and your ongoing online support, I’m not staying behind that unlocked door and suffering anymore! You’ve helped me so much! I’m trying hard to believe “I can do hard things” There is no better friend than a sister and there is no better, more refreshing sister duo than the Doyle Sisters 🤍🙌🏽👊🏽 This podcast is the bomb, Thank you xo
Can not love this more! THIS!!! Thank you G for bringing your voice to the podshere... I am so excited to do hard things with you! First 2 episodes are awesome!
Thank you Thank you so much!!! Gods I needed to hear all this. Love from Sydney❤️❤️
Worry Would love to hear you explore - worry equals love, or doesn’t it?
Good podcast Have read all Glennon’s books and mostly I love the podcast. One small thing- I think it’s an American habit of saying ‘right?’ after every few sentences, a bit like saying ‘like’ all the time. Maybe it’s because I’m a HSP, but I find that really grating 🤷🏻‍♀️But I love the topics, and hearing Amanda’s point of view on things as well. Tish’s song is amazing!! 🙌🏼
So good! Loved the first 2 episodes and really helped me to think about how I interpret others actions and how it’s so much more about them and their own stuff then how they feel towards me. Just really insightful and honest. Can’t wait for more
LOVE. Boundaries spoke to my heart. Finally hearing someone else describing how exhausting it is to monitor everything all the time to ensure everything is perfect to avoid the inevitable blow-up was a relief. I loved Untamed, I loved this episode and cannot wait for more. 💗💗💗
Can’t get enough.. G and sister, I’ve listened to the second episode two times already today. There’s just so much in it.. so many uh-huh moments. It’s accessible and relatable and unapproachable 😂in a good way.
Love love love Bless this universe for sharing your beautiful spark with the world Glennon and Amanda. Thank you 🙏
Love!! Love love love this podcast. Thank you Glennon and Amanda.
Love you Glennon Thank you 🇦🇺 xoxo 😘
Finally!! Somewhere that feels like HOME Glennon is my Spirit Animal❤️ That’s my highest praise because I love animals way more than people! Thank you for letting me see that I don’t have to fit in, or be normal.
Truth bombs Glennon & sister are masters of unpacking life with beautiful authenticity. They drop truth bombs like no one else. Truly the best
Love. Glennon & Amanda, you speak my language. Tish, your beautiful song is stuck in my head and my heart. Thank you.
Thank you G and Sister It hasn’t started yet and already I know this is a podcast we all need right now. Love you G.
✨The most FIERCE podcast you could listen to! ✨ When I hear Glennon speak, when she shares her view of the world...my heart releases a sigh of relief.  As if to finally say, “Yes!  Yes!  I am not alone in this big, scary world!”  It is as though she dove straight into my heart and made sense of it all.  She is the most brilliant of lights.  I simply adore her and the love she makes me feel...a love that gifts me with a knowing, a love that wraps around me like a big, cosy blanket and says softly, “I got you.  We’ve got this.”  All I can say is, thank you.  Thank you for telling your truth.  For standing in it.  It has paved the way for me and so many others.  Don’t call me, just text!  😜
Life is hard The honesty here is so beautiful it will take your breath away. Thank you so much for doing this ♥️🇦🇺
Love ❤️ we can do hard things Great first episode. Thanks for showing up 🙏 where can we find the song to download? AMAZING
Tish more pls Absolutely loved the podcast. Informative loving funny thoughtful. But what a gift Tish thank you for sharing you with the world. If you never do anything else that you share with the world you did this and it was enough and wonderful. But I really hope you share more. You are brave and beautiful and a truth teller. Thank you for sharing you with us.
Thank you!!! Absolutely love this podcast!! So very happy to have found it. You make perfect sense to me!! You’ve come into my life at the perfect time! Forever grateful to have you-Thank You:)
This is just gold! Thank you thank you thank you!
Seeing Hard Things Thank you for seeing, feeling and sharing - as tough as it is to hear such familiar experiences, I know things will be better when we start to really, very gently look at ourselves..
Tears of Gratitude... What a breath of fresh air! What a relief. The authenticity. The empathy, derived from human experience and truth. Utterly superb listening to you Glennon, and your sister. I was counting the kinder raffle fundraising money and folding my twins clothes, feeling less alone, and very seen. Maybe, just maybe, anxiety in me isn’t something I need to fix. Maybe it’s love, the love for my three children and the fierce experience of living through PND and a marriage separation, all while they are young, and living with a daughter who has additional needs. You are the first person to say that this isn’t something that needs fixing, rather it’s the price of loving and living our unique life path. That incredible gift of a song from Tish is pure and soulful, I dropped to my knees and sobbed. Thank you, thank you, thank you x  Sarah in Melbourne, Australia x
Brilliant! I am in tears after finishing the first episode and listening to Tish’s song. Just incredible. I know this podcast is going to help so many people, me included. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 💕✨
Glennon Doyle is a gift to the world ♥️ Honestly, I am so grateful for your words and bravery to share so deeply and vulnerably. It is women like you that are changing the world.   As is true in Untamed and on your social platforms, your ability to be so real while still profound will be the thing to encourage more and more humans to show up unapologetically and choose themselves, finally.   So many nuggets of wisdom in just the first episode, I’ll be listening again and again and likely referencing these words in my own work for years to come.
That song! It was a given that I would love this podcast – a podcast by Glennon and Sister…of course! But I was not prepared for that song. Good Lord, Tish-all that sensitivity of yours is turning out to be a gift for this world. Keep writing and singing. We need you!
Hungry Soul We Can Do Hard Things fed my hungry soul. G and Sister speak the truth with love. Normalising the human experience. At so many moment I wanted join their conversation and say, yes me too! PodSquad formed. Until I am ‘fed’ again keep doing life ♥️
Love this so much I’m a G fan and was so excited to know she was doing a podcast. This episode did not disappoint. Thank you for your honesty. And thank you for sharing Tish’s song. Wow, just amazing!
Anxiety Anxiety is tough, tough for any sufferer. I think others talking about it, others trying to understand it is just awesome. It feels less lonely, I feel less different. In reality we need a certain amount of anxiety to operate under pressure. It is just when social and general life anxiety gets a bit bigger than me I feel like there is something wrong with me. In fact nothing is wrong with me, I just have anxiety because I do, I am sensitive and caring and anxiety is a part of me. Having anxiety attacks makes me appreciate life when anxiety is silent for an hour a day, a week or however long it stays balanced. Thank you for letting us know that it’s okay to be anxious, we can do hard things, right.
Beautiful! This makes me do a happy dance of excitement and anticipation, and then it makes me cry with all the feelings and connectedness and then fist pump the air with delicious rebellion of creating a new path and then it makes me dance some more! 🤸‍♀️ This podcast is beautiful and I am so looking forward to each weeks raw magic. Thank you!
Raw rare and freakin epic! Loved the first episode!! The real and rawness of your journey and honesty is so helpful to others. Can’t wait to hear more!! Love from the land down under, Australia.
Podsquad started! Of course it was fabulous! It’s Glennon ❤️‍🔥
The Glennon we love! Having recently finished listening to Glennon’s Untamed on Audible I’m completely hooked! How wonderful to have further listening opportunities with this wonderful woman.
What a song! Loved the song at the end by Tish, so beautiful. Excited for the rest of the series.
We can do hard things Listened to the first episode as I painted, feeling tension and gut twisting welling up in my body in response to Glennon’s (& Sis’s) honest, vulnerable account of what anxiety does to their brains, bodies and lives, and it began to dawn on me that it dominates my life too. The episode continued with listener call in questions, more people baring their inner souls, and found myself crying by the end with relief and a sense of community that will help my own quest to do hard things. The podcast is run by people out there who deeply care about the world, who engage in genuine generosity of sharing spirit, who offer collaborative support through conversation, even a pod squad that says: ‘we got you’… and the end song!  So beautiful ❤️ Thank you for putting this (& yourselves) out there ! 🙏
Mind Blown I have no words as I’m in tears writing this .. Firstly that song We Can Do Hard Things will be something I listen to each and every morning as a mantra ..  Secondly G wow wow wow everything in this first episode got to me and is clearly something I need in my life .. Your words rang so true to me and got to my core.. Your voice is so soothing and warm  just like that first cup of coffee in the morning 🥰 .. Thankyou Thankyou for this pod cast you have no idea how much this saved me this morning whilst I was in my kitchen having an anxiety melt down .. ❤️❤️.. Everybody on the planet needs this podcast in their lives ..

I want more of her voice singing the beautiful words listening to the beautiful music she makes 🎼 🎶

Pre-emptive 5 stars I am yet to listen and eagerly await next week. If this podcast is even a smidgen awesome as Glennon’s other works then it will be a full 5 stars (plus some!) Subscribed and my ears and heart are ready to go on a journey. ❤️
Already 5 stars! Not one episode yet I’m giving it 5 stars already, because any podcast Glennon is heading up will 100% be worth the listen!
5 stars already I know this will be amazing, so I’m giving it 5 stars prior to release of the first episode. I can’t wait! Glennon, Amanda - thank you xx
I know this is going to be amazing! Glennon shares has a way of sharing that resonates so deeply.
Untamed airwaves... yes! As always, bringing the humane to the humans ... reminding us we’re all connected in those living feeling breathing troubled and joyous ways. I’m excited to hear more from you and your ‘islanders’ Glennon and the people like me who appreciate your work thus far.
Your podcast is like speaking to my loving sisters Dear ladies, I am so grateful for you and for providing such a smart, compassionate sisterhood, that provides me somewhere to go to when I need wisdom, hope and compassion for myself and others. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I feel so heard and understood and validated by you and your guests. ❤️😍
Abbey Wambach Will I ever be loved? Beautiful touching account of Abbey‘s life path thus far! It explains so much about her modest endearing nature, and made me just want to give her a big gigantic hug.. 🙏🤗😘🙏
Amazing! Dear Glennon, Dear Sister, I listen to a lot of podcasts, and there are many great ones out there. But no one like yours!  Listening to you two feels like a big warm hug full of compassion. It makes me feel less alone and way more normal.  Tishs song at the end is just so wonderful, I will learn the lyrics and sing it to my one year old daughter, or just listen to your wonderful girl with a glowing heart.  I can’t thank you enough for the time, energy and Heart you pour into your work. Everything you do has a tremendous impact on me and the world.  Thank you from all my soul! Nina from Berlin, Germany 😊
I walk through fire with you…thank you! Glennon, Amanda aka Sister, Abby, you are bringing more hope, light, knowledge, courage, joy, kindness, truth, and love to how I show up for my life and embrace the fullness and richness of my human experience. Thank you. Much love from a Moldovan, living in Belgium.
Important, relevant & funny This podcast is therapy! It puts in words things I’ve felt and I’ve known about the world, about being a woman, about being a parent… it’s a road map to being a breathing loving human.
hooked Just love this pod, the three of you and recognising myself in all 3 of you. How weird and wonderful is that. I love your vulnerability, openness, bold bravery in building connections by clarifying feelings. And bringing up such interesting guests to the pod. Always looking out for tuesday, in love with all of you 🙏🏼😘 THANK you!!!
This should get reimbursed by social security Absolutely love this podcast - it’s my medicine. Helps me breathing when I just cannot anymore.
From Belgium Lovely lovely Glennon, Sister and Abby. I so enjoy your podcast! I am so a mix of you guys and you made me so self reflect but also smile! I just wish I had known this 30 years ago. I’m 56 now but still learning. Thank you so much! I must admit I am more an Abby actually 😅but as an intravert The number of times I rewind the podcast! Just to make sure I heard it right (I often switch off when people talk too much😅) and I have already restarted the book with a marker without even have finished it! 😍😍😍 And Tish’s song is brilliant! I sing it now myself during my walks with my dog!
This podcast makes hard things easier and my life more beautiful! I have trouble finding the words to describe how life-altering this podcast is for me. I have listened to so many podcasts before, some of which I loved too, but this one is different. The authenticity, the humor, the way I often feel like Glennon and Amanda seem to talk straight to me. It’s absolutely amazing. It has helped me understand things about me and my life, it has given me comfort, it has given me release, it has made me laugh. It truly makes my life more beautiful and makes me believe in myself and my power.  I have no words to express how much I recommend this podcast! Thanks so much for this, G and sister.
So good Really enjoyed the first podcast. Very real, hit home and sweet mix of light and intensity.. Song of Tish’s at the end is beautiful.
Inspiring So wholesome. Please have Julianna Margulies on as a guest! 🤍
Amazing Life-changing, overwhelming, a present every week! Love you three. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
Unlock and love your full self This podcast is brilliantly made! Listening to it just feels like in touch more and more with who i am and powers me to keep doing hard things! Yes to all this amazing women nurturing power and love throughout the world! 🇧🇷
Everything!!! Imagine you’re in G’s living room having the most amazing and profound conversations about hard things with Sister and her. It’s become a must have for me as it sets the tone for the week.
My favourite podcast I’ve been on this healing journey for almost 2 years and this podcast has really helped me so much. Not feeling so alone with what I’m going through.. healing trauma and also coming off all my meds. Glennons perspective on coming off her antidepressants around the same time I did was an inspirational listen. Thank you ladies. I truly love this podcast and I am so thankful for it.
Getting very political Not as appealing anymore. The podcast has leaned in so heavily on politics.
Post Election Wow! I’m so impressed with the collective wisdom, compassion & empathy shared by the trio. Thank you. This episode feels foundational to my next steps.
Screechy sounds Topics were of interest to me, but why do so many podcasters have to have the loud and screechy voices? Maybe other people think it’s hilarious.  I had to turn it off pretty quickly, as an autistic woman with sensory issues.
Bravo ❤️ Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for sharing your wisdom and feelings on ‘the day after’. They all resonated with me deeply, inspiring me to shore up my community and inner strength and then continue to create a better world that I know is possible. I am Canadian, and yet grieving and raging deeply for my American Sisters and Brothers who fought so hard and stood up for truth, love, equality and justice for all. Never give up hope, even if we don’t see change in this lifetime - it will come one day.🫶
Post Election Family Meeting The best. Thank you.
Post Election Debrief Thank-you so much for being here post election. It has really undone my aloneness and despair.
The best I have been listening to this podcast for years and I’m so grateful for it 🖤
Thank you Thanks for helping us do life better. ♥️
😭 Glennon does not practice what she preaches. She interviews the most most incredible women, but She is a liar and a sell out. Save yourself the disappointment and heart break.
Episode 252 I’m sooo happy for Amanda. It was great to listen to her open up about her past and figure things out . So thankfull for all of you for letting us in and making us feel like we aren’t alone. Loved this podcast from day one❤️❤️
A safe space This podcast allows me to feel seen, heard and validated. I very much identify as a yearner, a feeler- similar to Glennon. It helps me open to to myself vulnerably and reflect on topics that bother me, while offering new perspectives.  Sometimes it’s too emotional for me and I need breaks. But for the most part, it’s my favourite podcast on this planet. If you have big feels- it’s for you.
Loved I really appreciate all 3 of you in many different ways. But I often find myself relating to sister in so many ways. I found this weeks episode where she answered questions, particularly interesting and insightful. I was left with some caring, but challenging questions to ponder and consider. Love to each of you and thank you for what you share with the podcast family!  Aug. 29/24.  Thanks to Abby for sharing about her grief. I'm sure you know about it. But Anderson Cooper has a marvelous podcast about grief, called "All There Is". Two seasons.  I highly recommend it.  Thinking of you. Sending much love.
Privileged self centered wokism I feel like people do not realize that these 3 women are rich as f***, talk about trauma like if they went to war (except the cancer thing of course), think they are popular and well known but are total strangers to most people (who watches rugby ???) and still act like they are victims of life and society. They didn’t want to work anymore so they just complain on a podcast instead.
Thank you Sometimes I wonder how you and your guests have eavesdropped on my life. Thank you for creating this space of sharing and sanity.   Excellent discussion on the current leadership dynamics in the Democratic party.
When You Feel Invisible This one!  This episode brought tears to my eyes.  Abby calls it as it is here and I wish I had that voice years ago as there are so many years of my life unphotographed.  No one will ever know I existed.
Goes deep and real The sincerity of these three podcasters truly makes the show special. They ask hard, unanswerable questions about life and struggle with them in truly deep and real ways. There’s very little fluff here, and no easy answers. Bravo, friends. I’m struggling along with you.
Like Therapy, but Free This podcast is full of helpful reflections on how to navigate hard life things. Listening to this podcast makes me feel less alone & more human.
More Alex First time I listened to your podcast and I thoroughly enjoyed it and I’m looking forward to part two with Alex
My real companion This podcast is my favourite podcast. I have listened to every single episode at least twice! It is wholesome, honest, witty and full of life altering discussions. I have “met” so many beautiful human beings here and the podcast feels like a friend to me at this point! I recommend to all my friends! It is brilliant!
Favourite podcast These three amazingly intelligent and insightful women are modern-day philosophers.
We’re with you, Sister! You got this, we got you. No one walks alone. I heard something powerful the other day and maybe it was a message of reassurance for you. I read someone ask why bother with terminal cancer treatment. To which their doctor replied: “buying you time buys you medical advances and moves the goal posts”  Sister, you said you weren’t worried necessarily about this, but possibly your long term longevity. Understandable worry of course but also there will be medical science advancements we can’t even dream of yet. My mom couldn’t believe I got an epidural for my labor and my grandma can’t believe all the life saving vaccines we have, like polio. I participate in Run For The Cure (a Canadian breast cancer foundation) annually, my little office has raised over $100K in 10 years and that’s just 14 of us. We are fighting hard and making a real change in the world of breast cancer. And that’s the tip of the iceberg. Humanity, (now) AI and our collective intelligence is incredible - you’ll be running along that fence side until you’re way too old and grey. Lots of virtual love, hugs and support to you.
Life Changing, For Real. Thank you for being brave enough to bring us these topics and to be open enough to have these respective conversations.   Sister. You got this.
Life Changing! Just Wow! I love this group of incredible beings!!! I am awake & inspired by Glennon, Abby & Sister!!!! Never Stop!
Episode 64 Thank you Doyle sisters and Abby for sharing your hard things. Sister - you are so very special to so many that I know you’re going to get through this okay.
Chelsea handler Platforming a genocide enthusiast who spreads propaganda is unconscionable. Do better.
Kitchen Table Wisdom Thank you Glennon, Abby, and Sister Amanda and your wisdom and your inspiring guest. So many brave conversations. I learn so much from every episode, chiefly how to be a better human. A much needed injection of positivity, won the hard, authentic way.  Paulie in Toronto
Love this show! This show is my happy place! Thank you, thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda
Made me cry - in a good way I listened to the “We can do Ordinary Things” episode and it had me captivated. It was so beautiful hearing her share about her life, and as a perfectionist/overachiever that was always told, “you will do amazing things!!”, it felt really cathartic. Thank you for sharing - what an amazing (and ordinary!) life ❤️
Such A Great Podcast! I have been listening to this podcast for a long time. I first heard about Glennon when Unbound came out, and I devoured the audiobook version very quickly. I was telling my brother about this amazing book I just finished, when he said ‘you know she has a podcast right?’, well that was it. I became a podsquadder, and have been a constant listener ever since! If you’re looking for a place to have the tough conversation and feel held by others you haven’t even met I HIGHLY recommend listening to this podcast.
Self care episode Just wanted to say how much I needed to hear the self care episode and for introducing me to Pooja’s work. I cried when I heard it and gave myself permission to take a sick day and just rest and think about my values and why I am so clenched and how to unclench. Thank you for this podcast. Your show is my lifeline.
Thank you ❤️ I have been listening since this podcast’s inception and it continues to change my life for the better every week. Thank you three for your vulnerability and care while we all navigate the ever increasing challenges of being human ❤️
IFS with Dick & Glennon I just finished listening to the episode with Glennon doing some IFS work and it was extremely helpful for me to have a deeper understanding of this type of therapy. I am currently working on integrating my exiled selfs with my therapist and instead of my usual feeling of fear I am actually excited for my next session. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for continuing to go to those vulnerable places to help us podsquaders learn and heal. 💖
Great podcast! I just started listening to this podcast, and I’ve already started thinking about things differently. It’s so relatable, and I laugh out loud on every one I listened to so far. Keep being awesome! 😁
Thank you all SO Much! Wow. Thank you all SO much for every single podcast you have ever done! There have never been three women who have ever touched my so deeply. I have learnt so much. Hearing your conversations and feeling your love lifts me up.  You guys are doing amazing work.
So grateful The Alok episode…wow. What an incredible human. I just finished listening and I need to listen to it again. When Alok talked about a beauty playlist, I thought that’s what the three of you, along with your wonderful guests are to me. Thank you for pouring so much beauty, love and hope into the universe! xx
So happy I found this soul food Somewhere along the way in parenting a child with special needs, I lost myself.  That child is now almost 16 and I am slowly finding glimmers of myself again in many different forms…podcasts being one of them.  I found your podcast because I was searching for podcasts with “Brene Brown”.  I was hooked on your show from that episode on.  There is something I really miss about having conversations with people seeking their inner truth.  I don’t have that currently in my life like I did when I was a carefree 20 something year old free spirit living in Vancouver. Now I’m a 50 something year old mom who’s soul feels completely lost…but you three, and your wonderful guests are helping me find it again.  Keep being the awesome, struggling, real, strong women that you are.  You are not only doing hard things but you are doing important things.   -Lisa
You guys rock I am so grateful I stumbled onto your podcast… I have never been so moved and been given such an access of a  treasure trove of wisdom to learn from. Thank you!!  I been doing hard things my whole life!!!!!  CPTSD, Severe co-dependency, the list is a long one my friends!  Thank you! Never stop this!!
Love! I absolutely love this podcast and it has changed the way I think about so many things in life. I have learned so much. Absolutely fantastic! I recommend to friends all the time.
Episode 268, 269 and 281 I love the vulnerability and openness of the pod. The letter from love episodes were wonderful. So moving and inspiring. Love hanging out with you. Off to write my letter. xo
Episode 283 Congratulations on another fantastic episode. Such beautiful discussions and Critical lessons! It’s as if you ladies were channeling wisdom from our past Ancestors and the Universe. Share this episode to everyone you know People!!👌❤️❤️❤️
Episode 278 THANK YOU! I am a 68 yr. woman who made this decision. I have had thus far a GREAT life and do NOT regret it. The non-respect from people was ridiculous especially since my career was in a male dominated field. My life, my choice, sound familiar! Your podcast provides me with so much peace of mind.
Must be hard for you to support Jewish women Well we finally found the hard thing you cannot do. Supporting Jewish women who have been raped and tortured by terrorist. Maybe you should look deep inside yourself at your antisemitism and really try to see why you didn’t jump all over the terrorists the minute you heard about the massacre. You stayed silent and today for some insane reasons you have decided Rafah is your breaking point -wow wow wow no words but if you wanna talk please call me I will gladly educate you and provide you with some facts
Episode 272 I just listened to this one and it may be the single most impactful podcast EVER! I struggle with my sobriety but something changed inside me when I listened today. The overwhelming sense that society/ culture uses alcohol to keep  people ( women esp) down . NO MORE! The reflection piece was amazing . Thanks for all you do!!
Exactly what I needed to hear! I listened to episode 274. What is our rage telling us. I haven't felt more accepted and understood than I did listening to this podcast. Thank you for being you, I love the humour and authenticity you ladies bring!
Loveliest podcast From expert advice to stories of going to the Girls Just Wanna Weekend, this podcast is delightful!
Simply Life Changing Hi Glennon, Amanda & Abby 👋 I live in Canada, and we have a day in January each year; called ‘Bell Let’s Talk Day’. It was an initiative started a number of years ago, to encourage the opening up about our mental health; and ultimately money is donated to mental health funds based on the number of social media and communication interactions that include the branded hashtag, #BellLetsTalk  On this annual day that took place on January 24th this year, I made the quick decision to open up about my story so far on Facebook; and part of my strength to do so comes from you three! I feel like I’ve found my tribe in each of you, where transparency isn’t looked down upon; but rather celebrated!  So I am open to have my story shared out there in the big scary world, and if you or anyone reading this has a desire to share it; or a suggestion as to where to share, I would appreciate any and all suggestions. Community is created when we dare to reach out to others ❤️
Thanks! Just listened to the Birthday episode on my birthday!  I'm 47 today, and I'm feeling grateful and so happy to be alive.  The universe sent me this as a gift.  Thank you to you three!
This podcast is my self-care! Hi Abby, Glennon, and Sister,  Just wanted to send a little note to thank you for addressing so many issues that people tend to shy away from or avoid talking about. You are certainly helping people feel less alone in the world and give practical tips and strategies to help in sticky situations. The three of you SHOW UP with humour, vulnerability, and authenticity and that’s truly what keeps me coming back to listen each week. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for being so REAL. 🩷
Exactly what I needed to hear today I have had a very difficult life journey and I am so grateful that I found your podcast.  Thank you all so very much.
Transcendent honesty grace and grit. Laura Mckowen - this was it. These two episodes are exactly exactly right.  I’ve loved every episode but these two have hit the nail on the head with such resounding clang the reverberations are shaking through my whole life and understanding of myself. The fortitude of Laura, her connection to Glennon. The mural seeing of both of them refracted through Abby and Amanda. These are the consciousness raising circles that are changing the world. I will now proceed to read everything Laura has ever written and await the next episode (as always) with baited breath. From the very bottom of my heart… thank you.
Life changing As a soccer fanatic I came for Abby but stayed for the life changing wisdom each episode brings. The raw and true perspectives brought by all really hit home and bring the authenticity I’ve been searching for. I love that we get to be a part of the ins and outs of each person’s growth journey, and because of their transparency and honesty we get to grow right along side them.
Open hearts and curious minds I’m grateful to have found this thoughtful and wise podcast. Interesting guests and meaningful topics support the inspiring aim of doing hard things. Thank you.
Lurve 268 and 269 🥰💙🥰
The wisdom I never thought I’d know This podcast has hit home so many times for me. Abby specifically has given me so many insights regarding my own path. It’s nice having someone to relate to and be represented in. I listen to some of your episodes on repeat bc I want to make sure I am soaking it all in. The vulnerableness and  authenticity give me confidence to be the same and give words to feelings I have had. You all are just awesome! I laugh and cry and ponder through almost every episode. Keep it up!
Filled with love These conversations are so needed and so helpful. I walk away feeling inspired and lifted up, thank you so much for sharing your hearts with us. 💙💙
Thank you This pod feels so homey, comfort found in common humanity, authenticity and fun. Thank you. I’ll always be listening.
This podcast feeds my soul I love this podcast and these three women. I have listened to every single episode since they started. I read Untamed when I was struggling to understanding my own addiction to alcohol and reading that book really got me through and opened my eyes to a whole new life. Thank you ladies for all the topics you cover and your complete vulnerability on what you’re struggles are. You make me feel so seen and I can’t thank you all enough. We can do hard things!
MY FAV PODCAST, MY FAV WOMAN I started listening to We Can Do Hard Things when they were only 6 episodes in. To say that this podcast fundamentally changed my life is the understatement of the century, like goddamn. Thank you Glennon, Abby, and Sister for showing up with authenticity and vulnerability every single week, the ripples of change you’ve made in this world are monumental.
What The World Truly Needed This podcast is so deeply healing and is exactly what the world needed. Abby, Glennon and Amanda have beautiful chemistry, empathy and a commitment to learning that is so refreshing. I have listened to every single episode and I really appreciate all the work that went into them. I would love to see Brene Brown as a guest speaker because I think that would be amazing. But regardless, I’ll be tuning in often to this space. Thank you for sharing your incredible gifts with us all.
Amazing women and amazing content This might be my very favourite podcast. So many important, beautiful, messy conversations. I am constantly blown away by the honesty, vulnerability and humour that are mingled together in every episode. Glennon, Abby and Amanda, you are what the world needs. Thank you thank you thank you!
Episode 258 Came here to join the chorus of gratitude to Abby for sharing so truthfully. Your reflections hit deeply and uprooted some patterns that I have been avoiding seeing. You’ll get there Abby. So will I. Our birthright of holding ourselves beloved. Love you all. Thank you.
The most real, honest podcast there is Episode 258…wow. Never felt so understood in how I truly feel in my whole life. I relate so much to Abby in so many ways. Thank you Abby for sharing this raw, personal side of you. I feel so seen & validated and I think this opens up a new area of feelings to explore & process that I could never fully put into words till now. Thank you. You’re not alone, not even in the slightest. 🤍
Episode 178 but for swifties I loved Glennon’s metaphor for sorting your mail (dealing with criticism). Couldn’t help but think while listening:  #1-3 SHAKE IT OFF junk mail about appearance, relationships, personality.  #4 IF I WERE THE MAN gendered comments #5 YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN disrespectful approach My teen has brainwashed me into becoming a Swiftie and I hope to embody Abby’s persistent commitment to learning the lyrics before the Canadian era of her tour.
258 Wow ladies! I just listened to this on a night alone. I listen often. Thank you for reaching into the dark spaces not many people go too.  Abby, thank you for you raw true self. I had some tears with you listening. Yours tears allowed me to really listen to a part of me that I struggle with. That deep unloving place. Not many people go there or even spend seconds discovering this place. Thank you for revealing a place that we all feel.  I have felt this all my life. A place on this earth where you feel like you have never belonged. Like you are different. Because you are this way or that way. Not like the OTHERS.  WE are a different kind. We feel more deeply and see things differently. Remember you are loved and this planet was created for us. Things have just changed here and we see more clearly then other people do. There is nothing wrong with us we have just been made to feel that there is.  Ladies keep doing what you are doing!! You have opened up a place for women to feel real and be who they were born to be. Thank you for being you and for sharing your struggles and making the rest of us feel normal in this chaotic world.
Healing Abby, Glennon and Sister have become my super heros in that you all bare your souls and have difficult conversations that allows us all to have hard conversations in our lives. The episode about Abby’s therapy has made me realize that 2 people in a relationship can heal individually and be better together.  What a gift you three are to the world.  Thank you for sharing your lives.  Love, light and weirdness to you all ❤️
Dear Abby I too am struggling with the reparenting process right now, trying to understand how to feel self love. What I have found the most helpful is massive amounts of grieving, and “no bad parts” by Richard Schwartz. Love you.
Yes! I never miss an episode. I’ve learned so much from listening to these insightful, generous and funny woman share with each other and with us. Definitely a podsquadder!
Rich, entitled, navel gazing This podcast came recommended by your friend, but it’s absolutely painful to listen to. These women are so caught up in themselves, living in boxes made of mirrors where all they can see are themselves. They have no sense of how difficult life it is for the everyday person, no comment on the state of the world, only poor me, poor me, poor me.
Healing When three woman get together and share hard things from their heart it creates a wave that pushes out into this world and over time the ebb and flow of that wave begins to awaken others into their own truth and awareness of self and collectively we discover we can all do hard things.
What I need I am a woman who was in a bad marriage for 27 years. When I left I found this podcast. It’s exactly what I needed. When people ask me how I manage on my own I tell them, that I have a good counsellor and I listen to We can do hard things.  The three of you sharing your triumphs and struggles made me believe that I too can do hard things and I have.  Thank you 💗
Thank you! Just listened to episode 254 and wow! Literally everything you all discussed helped me so much! In my parenting to older children (34 and 23) and also reminding me of my own wants and needs at 60!! Thank you, thank you for your brave honesty and love you send out into the world 🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜
The only podcast I listen to consistently As a working parent everything you publish resonates for me. I love how you tell it like it is and really dig deep into an issue. I don’t have time for superfluous stuff in my life but I make time for this!!!
Magic podcast The three of you are absolute magic together. Thank you for all of the gifts that you have given us. So grateful for you three. ❤️❤️❤️
Love it! Thank you for creating this intelligent and thought-provoking podcast.  It engages my mind and shifts my perspective, and for that I am grateful.  🙏🏻
get the truth from someone appreciate the intent of levity - but… truth is hard - and we can do hard things.
Feels like family. Glennon, Abby, sister. You feel like the family in me never had. Thank you for your candour, rawness and laughter. Thank you for being you.
Intro to Andrea Gibson & Abby I loved that this podcast introduced me to the work and voice of Andrea Gibson. The second episode with Andrea along with Megan was so honest & touching. Thank you for showcasing their work.  Also love Abby and her voice and her story. What a journey so far!
North Star To the entire podcasting team … Miigwech , thank you for the generous and healing medicine you offer to all of us listening  Glennon your personal stories about your ED journey truly truly transformed my life.  I read and gathered info and insights about ED and all things carried etc for most of my life and over the past few years I have been healing and you helped me be brave enough to talk to a counsellor and speak my truth  All of you inspire my creative practice of art journaling, eco conscious of course 🥰.   Thank you.  Miigwech  Jenn  Nimki kwe , Thunder woman 💜
F*** those mean girls Episode 241! As a former(?) orangutan spotter, I was excited for this one. So agree that we all need to aim for the high road, but now remind myself that even Michelle Obama has friends that she talks out all the low road options with beforehand. ❤️❤️❤️
Oprah Interview Loved this exchange. Sobbed numerous times. Beautiful
It doesn’t get better than this Do yourself a favour. Listen to the Oprah episode today. All the way to the very end.
Misalignment Having Oprah in the episode after the devastation in Hawaii and her socially unaware decision to ask the public for donations was a poor choice. Given the values this podcast claims to stand for, and the charity that Glennon and her sister started, it was very disappointing. Please consider the Native people of Hawaii who have lost everything and whom are being further oppressed by colonial greed every day. Oprah sits on stolen land and did not even offer shelter to her neighbours. She is in the worlds 1% top wealthy yet she asked those of us struggling to put food on the table for donations. Either use the opportunity to call her in or kindly cancel the interview and show solidarity with the audience you claim to relate to.
Beautiful ❤️ Life affirming and heart opening to have words and guidance I am so so grateful!  Keep sharing !!! Thank you 🙏
Life Giving! Thank you Sister, Glennon, Abby, Guests and Pod Squad!! I’m having trouble finding all of the words to say about all of the things that I feel when I listen to this podcast, but it is everything to me. I am so grateful for the three of you. The work that you’ve been doing, the incredible people you’ve given space to, and the gorgeous community of humans who have been brought together because of your love and honesty and has been absolutely life giving. This podcast has helped me in so many ways. It has challenged me, held me, lightened me, grounded me and given me a sense of community like I’ve never felt before. Thank you for doing hard things everyday and holding space for others to do the same. Love love love, Rachel
Brave, vulnerable and tenacious This podcast offers insights to help us better understand ourselves and others. The hosts are brave, vulnerable and tenacious in their desire to understand themselves and others
Beautiful and life-affirming I am so moved by this podcast. Thank you thank you thank you.
Growing with you Thank you for helping me be a better human and for helping me raise better humans. I am thankful to be a part of the pod squad because this life thing can be lonely and this is such a safe space to learn and grow. Thank you.
Love this podcast After every episode Glennon asks:  if you liked this podcast let us know etc. So here I am letting you know that I love this podcast. I am learning so much. I am learning how little I know. I am learning I am not alone with my stuff. I am learning that dealing with stuff is hard and takes time.  I am learning to look at myself in a less critical way. I am learning it’s worth doing the hard stuff. Thank you for opening your hearts and sharing of yourselves in each podcast. I feel like I’m getting to know you Glennon, Abby, Amanda .. and am feeling love for each of you. Keep on doing this. I will keep on listening and encouraging others to also tune in. xoxox Lydia
How to human The reason I trust Amanda and Abby and Glennon is the honesty. The unpopular, inconvenient, confusing realities of life. Life is effing messy and hard. The maps are wrong, no one has it figured out, but you guys show up fully, and it is everything. Thank you for living out loud so we feel seen and real and honoured. 💛
Love. Pure Love.
Thank you Your podcast is a blessing. Thank you all for sharing yourselves with the world. 💕
Love love love this POD! I have listened to every single episode and absolutely love these 3 women! It’s self-care time just to be with them. Truly my favourite POD. 💙
Intelligence and Integrity We Can Do Hard Things!  A podcast that has nothing MID about it, which is why I enjoy it so much!  I have tried other podcasts with seemingly intelligent women but much of it ends up being rambling free talk. WCDHT podcast is tight - not a wasted word - it doesn’t insult me. It values my time.  Do I agree with every guest and topic? Obviously not , but I appreciate hearing all of it because it is so thoughtfully and intelligently presented. Please don’t get too mid on me - ha ha!  By the way I’ve never heard the term before your last podcast which explains my overuse of it here.
Amazing honest and real conversations This is a podcast that I always look forward to listening to. The honest conversations between Glennon, Abby, and Sister (Amanda) and the vulnerability that they all bring to this podcast is amazing! This show is funny, deep and caring. I appreciate all of the candid interviews and discussions. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I am grateful for all of the constant challenges that listening to this show continues to encourage me to do hard things in my life. Thank you for letting me listen to your journey. You are all a part of my journey too.
Wasn’t ready for it I had to come back to this podcast. When I first listened I couldn’t connect but I’m back and it’s exactly what I needed. Thank you 🙏🏻
Changed my mind! I gotta admit I put off listening for a long while, thinking more belly button gazing. But like a lot I can be wrong about (!), I LOVE IT!!! The perspective and humour are perfect 👌Like I’m sitting at a table with you all…
Enneagram wisdom I love this podcast!  Always deeply inspiring & insightful guests. I particularly found Suzanne Stabile’s wisdom of the enneagram to be intriguing. I’m now pretty sure of my number!
New mama of Advance Maternal Age This podcast has quickly become my go-to. I have laughed so hard and cried too, learned so much and been given new perspectives listening to the fantastic takes you three bring to us each week. I just had my first baby at 43 (I am just a few days younger than Abby) and living my best days so far. I am not a young mama and would have been called geriatric until recently. I feel great however and completely enjoy spending my early mornings with my beautiful girl listening to your voices and identifying with so much in each episode. Keep making shoes for a long time please.
Best advice Thank you Glennon,Abby,Sister for being so committed in doing your podcasts. This work you are helping all of us do it too important. You help me matter to myself, and have the courage to self sovereign. Love you all so much, and especially you Abby what you did for equal pay mind blowing!!!
YES PLEASE THE ACTUAL BEST   I LISTEN TO EVERY EPISODE sorry for the caps. Not sorry. In love with y’all and everything you put into the world through this podcast. Can’t wait to meet you in person some day.   🌞🌈🌻
Love. Love. Love. This place holds so much good for my heart, mind and soul. Thank you for creating it.
Podcast or Tish & Brandi’s song? Please don’t get me wrong, I truly enjoy this podcast. The last few guests and conversations in particular have been so good. I do however think that the song at the end by Tish resonates with me so deeply and importantly, that for me it is the star.
Sex Fantasies and Fruit Roll ups Loved the episode with Vanessa Morin from may 2023. It really explains where sexual shame/embarassment fear comes from - our values using great analogies with food . My favourite “we dont ask why we love Thai food? We just do”  I really appreciate the practical tips based in evidence based science/research.  Really well done. I would recommend this to my patients who are struggling with sexual intimacy/conenction, my friends, my partner, anyone really. !  excellent job
Cathy C. Every episode is a treasure. But it’s  the honesty of you three that really makes it and creates this feeling of intimacy and brings us listeners closer. Like we’re all at the therapy session together. A million thank yous!! ❤️
Easily the best podcast on earth. I’ve never listend to an episode and left uninspired. I learn something every SINGLE episode. These women are incredible resources of wisdom and ask life’s most interesting questions. Thank you Glendon, Abby and Sister for all that you do (and wearing your own world on your sleeves for the rest of us to learn from). My life goal is to be insightful enough to come on your show!
Deep soul food The depth of conversation and the candidness of the three hosts is a balm to my spirit . I love this podcast. There is something deeply touching in the topics covered but also the raw realness of how they talk about it. Listening to this podcast quenches my thirst for a deeper yearning for connection and understanding of the human experience.
Autism Episode It really was eye opening and makes sense. Thank you for having Katherine on and shedding more light on us neurodivergent’s. Wish more ppl would understand it’s not a burden, but a GIFT! Luv from Ont, Canada!
Impressive helpful interview with Katherine May What a great conversation and so helpful. Learned lots.
Love it I’m in love with this podcast. It is something I want and need in my life. ❤️
Thanks from mom of queer tween in Canada Hey all, thanks for that fun episode with corook and Olivia. I sent it to my 11-year old non-binary kiddo who is absolutely obsessed with singing and playing the ukulele. They have had the toughest year (and so of course have I.) it’s frightening to realize how at risk our queer youth are and yet I don’t want to get lost in the cloud of fear. Your podcast burns off the clouds. Thank you!
What the world needs now and always I listen in the morning as I get ready, as I drive to work or to my errands, and as i just sit here drinking my coffee. This podcast touches my heart and I am grateful for every episode and each time I see a new episode. You are embodying what the world needs now. Thank you. ❤️❤️
Authentic, Inspiring & REAL This podcast and these 3 amazing women is/are so incredibly brave, inspiring, brilliant, vulnerable and 100% REAL. The guests they invite and the conversations they have bring me insight, inspiration and JOY! I love Glennon, Abby & Amanda with all my heart… Thank You.
We CAN do hard things I have a mug that I drink coffee out of every morning that says “we can do hard things,” and it has gotten me through the pandemic, amongst other hard days. Thank you all for your insights, the lovely guests you bring on, and your compassionate lens as you take on difficult topics. So much love you all three of you.
Andrea Gibson One of the best, if not the best, conversation yet. Thank you so, so much for welcoming it in and sharing it all.
Got my back up Many beautiful wisdoms shared in this show. AND I got my back up while listening to the part where talking about kids with ADHD how helpful it is to know if a “parent” also has it - because there’s a very good chance (40 was it) that a parent will have it. I’m a queer parent with an adopted kid and kids who were birthed by my ex-wife. I have ADHD. Which is helpful in many ways when I parent my kids with ADHD. AND none of my kids are biologically related to me. Just mentioning this because it felt like a surprising assumption about what a “parent” is.
Always my first choice! Feeling sad? I listen to this podcast! Feeling lonely? I listen to this podcast! Feeling happy and productive? Yup, I listen to this. Listening to Abby, Sister, and Glennon and their incredible guests always leaves me better informed, uplifted, and inspired! This is my go-to podcast for fierce feminist dialogue that isn’t afraid to hold space for the tenderness of being human. I appreciate the honesty, the calls to action and the invitations to just show up to life as we are. Thank you for continuing to bring such beauty into the world!
This podcast is my church. I am so grateful to have a podcast that makes me feel like I am a part of a community who are want to learn and grow and change each of our little piece of the world. It’s nice to not be figuring it all out on my own. 💜
Always so much food for thought Always so much to think about in your episodes, sometimes I have to pause it for a couple days to mull it over before listening to the rest. Always a fresh take on the topic. Sometimes I listen to an author on another podcast being asked the table of contents of their book, basically, and I look to see if you have an episode with them so I can hear a more candid and thought-provoking conversation about the material and how to use it in our lives. I have shared this show more than any other. My 9-year old daughter and I sing ‘we can do hard things’ to each other whenever we need to hear it. Love each of you and how you lift each other up and challenge each other, and us.
Grateful Just want to say how grateful I am for your podcast. All three of you have such beautiful insights that have helped me so much over the last six months since I started listening.  I just finished listening to the over functioning episode. I am an over functioner who is really struggling. I think I have to re-listen again and again.  There was so much that I want to absorb and learn. I appreciate all of you from the bottom of my heart.
Very helpful !! Just recently started listening to your podcast and I can’t get enough !! I love you all and it is so helpful.  I read Untamed and am getting your other books. Thank- you all for sharing with such honesty and openness your journeys . It is making me more open and honest about my life’s journey to others as well.  I keep sending podcasts to friends because I know how much they helped me !! I’m not sure if you’ve done any shows on sexual abuse because that is the issue that I am dealing with.  I’ll have to look through to see.
Outsider I’m probably way outside your expected demographic for the podcast by 20 years. And I was a reluctant convert for multiple reasons. But I’ve learned and stretched so much through listening to you all. I appreciate and honour your willingness to dig deep and find the treasures in our dark places.
Serenity amongst the hard things I never would have thought that thinking about hard things would bring me such serenity. This podcast is not only a safe space, but a kind, loving, and peaceful place for me, all with the backdrop of dealing with issues, questions, and feelings that are not always easy to face. I tend to distract myself to avoid dealing with the hard things, but I find listening to this podcast eases me into a comfortable discomfort, if that makes any sense at all.
Favourite show! I love this show so much! I can’t listen to anything else right now. It is so fun, connecting, funny, wise… all the good things. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda, so much.
love your show YOU are the best- love your honesty & vulnerability -feels like chatting with best friends ❤️❤️Sharon MR
Eating disorder omissions I love the show but I’m in awe of how there is so much discussion of embodiment and eating disorder recovery without any awareness of fatphobia and diet culture. The last episode in embodiment literally lists all oppressions but never fatness. The show is otherwise so political about queerness and gender and feminism, but the silence around body size is glaring. You can’t discuss eating disorders in a serious way without the context that we live in a world that hates fat people, especially women, and is set up against fatness. Eating disorders can be about a lot of things - control, trauma ,misogyny - as this show is so eloquent about. But eating disorders would not exist the way they do without this crucial cultural context that we are taught that fat is a personal failure from before we can even talk.  Bodies come in all sizes due to genetics and always have, and all bodies are good bodies. You cannot tell how healthy someone is by looking at them. A show that so often talks about ED and trauma should acknowledge this.
Thank you Literally just thank you Glennon Abby and Sister I love you guys
Don’t tell Glennon to love her body! I have been enjoying each and every episode I have ever listened to. Glennon, the podcasts that have been shared with us during your recovery are eye opening and very meaningful. This particular episode, I found to be very deep. it has given me a lot to think on. The relationships the three of you have with each other are rare to be a part of. It is so perfectly clear that you cherish and support each other with tremendous respect, love and open arms. I admire the courage and strength that it has taken for each of you to share your vulnerability with the pod squad.
Best podcast I love almost every episode so much (of course some don’t speak to me but I’d say 95% do!!). Episode #206 was life-changing. Glennon, Abby and Sister bring balance to the podcast that is so perfect and I appreciate the three of you and all your guests so much! Thank you for creating such necessary and beautiful material!
Incredible episode with dr.Hillary Mcbride I love this podcast and am deeply appreciative of the vulnerability and open hearted leadership each of the hosts is clearly working so hard to cultivate in themselves and share with the listeners. The episode with Dr.Hillary McBride is by far my favourite conversation to date. Wow. Glennon said it well, Hillary is a “damn international treasure”. Thank you Hillary for showing up as you do and being a forerunner for us all on this journey back into our bodies and the reclamation of our individual power. That you podcast team for making this interview happen.
Yum yum YUM! The love and authenticity that pours out of this podcast is just delicious 🙏🥰
Love love love Don’t actually have words for the impact the 3 of you have had on my actual mental health and life. Thank you for doing this meaningful work and sharing it with us.
The honesty and authenticity Wow really enjoyed the Abby episode because it feels like a whole new level of honesty and rawness compared to when guests come on (those are amazing too). I feel for you and I feel so seen and this pod just gives me courage to be seen. Thank you❤️
📢 Enneagram 4, INFP, HSP (so fun!)🙃 Y’all are Life Savers. All the time. Never stop or I’m moving in. XO
Better than ice cream I super love this podcast- it is so real and honest and it just feels like a treat to listen to it.  And I love the variety of guests who are interviewed and how many episodes there are. Amazing.
My escape I’m in an abusive relationship and these three women are my escape. I walk my dog and listen to them multiple times a week and pretend they are my friends. I’m so grateful for them
Simply the best We love listening to Glennon, Abby, and Sister. Our favourite pod on the planet ❤️
You are all blessings in my life. I am positive you do not need to hear how wonderfully eclectic, brave, informative, inspiring and insightful you three are.  I learn deep truths from every podcast.   Thank you   Della
Episodes 202 This resonated so deep. After 30 years living this way I step away because I was exhausted. My life now-4years later- is a road of healing and relearning who I am. But it’s the happiness that I have found that makes it all worth the hard stuff! Thank you for giving a damn!
Episode 202 I just listened to the above episode and it was confusing, disturbing, sad. I do understand Glennon sharing her journey but just not sure this episode would be helpful to others going through the same thing. Glennon does not sound well and honestly hasnt for months. I feel I will stop listening for a while as I think hearing a person going through hell without any solution is awful. I also feel for the other two hosts who have become mostly listeners. Hope for all things get better. This hard thing sounds impossible.
Love it! Entertaining, funny, and full of information. Thanks!
EPIC POD- They put my feelings into words I have been listening and recommending this podcast to everyone I know and sending episodes almost every week for over a year, but never written a review until this last episode: don't tell Glennon to Love her body.   The reason why I need for review now is to say this should be required for entry into western society as a women in order to understand why we feel the way we do. I studied philosophy, and this is philosophy for our time.   They are funny, raw, ridiculous, kind and intelligent. They are people everyone wishes they had in their life and I am so grateful they are open enough to share their true feelings in order for the rest of us to understand ourselves.   I would've never considered myself in need of recovery until Glennon story, I never would've thought of being funny as a power until listening to Amanda's and I never would've been so grateful for my elite sports background making me who I am if it weren't for Abby.  Thank you all so much for what you do and please NEVER STOP!!!!
Comforting in hard times I love listening to Glennon, Abby and Sister! This podcast offers guidance, laughter and relatability! There is nothing fake here, we learn from them being honest about life and the struggles it throws us!
All I can say, is amazing! Glendon, your last two podcasts about your recovery were so enlightening. The wisdom that you now have in regards to your recovery I am so glad you shared. I am 57 years old have had an eating disorder most of my life and the concept of ever liking my body let alone loving it is completely foreign. Listening to you allowed me to give myself permission to let go of this goal. I will work every day at seeing my body and my mind and my soul as one. Thank you!
Listen Up! This podcast has so many great guests, plus Glennon, Abby and Amanda are amazing! 100% worth the time.
Now I’M crying! Episodes 188, 189, & 190 were SO beautiful to bear witness to, through your podcast. Gosh, I adore your family! Thank you for sharing yourselves so vulnerably. That’s a whole lotta love!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
This podcast has changed my life This podcast feels like my wisdom friend that tells me that everything will be ok. That no matter what I am going through, I am not alone, and mostly I can do it, because we can do hard things. This is a true life changer; mindset changer. This is pure light in this world. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to Glennon, Abby and Amanda. Your light shines in my heart. Forever grateful. ❤️
My walking podcast ! Love this podcast- happy to be in the 'squad'. You all bring new light to subjects that taunt and tickle us! Your individual viewpoints and honesty are inspiring. Suzanne
The best! I love all three of you! Thank you for doing such an amazing job with this podcast! ❤️
So helpful ❤️ Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda! I’ve been listening for only a few months and the topics you all cover have been so helpful in my relationships and parenting and just, well … life. ~Crystal
Love this podcast!! Great topics and guests!
Thank you! Ladies, thank you for initiating hard conversations, making space for our uniqueness and entertaining us all in the most inspiring ways. You are what gets me on my exercise machines.   IF you could let the mom Erica from the episode with Cheryl Strayed know that she is not alone and that another mom learning to love her son who is in recovery from addictions know that she is not alone, I’d appreciate that. I’d love to offer my support and wisdom if she is open to it.   We sure can do hard things!!! Even impossible ones.   🤍🤍
Morning sanity The chatter in my head starts almost the minute my feet hit floor each morning. I put Paul McCartney and Wings on while I shower just to drown out the shrieking shorty-committee in between my ears. Then, as I head out the door and embark on my transit to work, I pop in my headphones, put on We Can Do Hard Things and let Abby, Amanda, and Glennon guide me to my destination. With humour and so many levels of feeling understood, these women have been helping me feel a little less insane/scared/doomed w every episode I hear. There’s not a stinker in the bunch. They treat all their guests as old friends and it makes me feel less alone than I do as I face the morning scaries. Thank you for your service. You are all such brave badasses. Oh, and the tears spring up IMMEDIATELY when the Tish and Brandi closing song comes on. Happy tears, happy tears!!!
Cheryl episode What a drag…someone who celebrates her ‘special ability’ around drinking. Don’t care about her ‘journey’…she’s a sham.
It’s like a weekly catch up with long time friends I truly love these authentic humans who have shared so much of themselves with every single episode recorded.  The guests, the topics, the recommendations of books and other podcasts etc have been life changing for me.  Thank you- thank -you -thank you, from deep within my soul. ❤️
Best podcast Glennon, Abby & Amanda have become a big part of my life - I feel like I know them because  they share so much of themselves with us.  I listen in on my daily walks as they touch on every subject that is on my mind. They do it with love & understanding, compassion & humour. I learn and I laugh - they’re nothing short of brilliant. They have the best and most meaningful podcast (for me anyway!) ❤️.
The absolute best! This podcast has changed my life. I can’t think of anything more uplifting, optimistic, inspiring, and hilarious to listen to. This podcast brightens my day during the craziness of life with young kids and working full time. I just love it!
My Favourite Podcast We Can Do Hard Things is my very favourite podcast. I am always in the mood to listen to an episode. I feel blessed to live in the same world at the same time as Glennon, Abby & Sister. Their insights are invaluable and their honesty and vulnerability is so paramount for those wanting to better themselves, as well as “the culture.” Thank you all for being who you are and sharing what you do.
Phenomenal It’s like an hour with my most brilliant friends. ❤️
Soul feeding There are those people in this life who have that ability to speak the hard/beautiful/vulnerable  truths and that is what your podcast does! I find myself nodding along or shouting out loud, “right?!” Or “yassssss!” My husband and kids know when I’m listening to you 3 and affectionately joke and mimic my “mmm-hmm’s”  I can not count the times I break things down on my walks with my husband.  After listening I will replay moments so we can talk about a particular revelation. It’s feeding my soul (and my families) and I appreciate all of you and the incredible guests you have on. Thank you for your authenticity and sharing it with the world! ❤️
Transformational This podcast has taught me so many ways to reframe difficult things and also given me insight into the knowledge of amazing women who are changing the world. As an immigrant away from family and friends, this podcast is my weekly “chat with girl friends” that I miss so much. Abby, Glennon and Amanda, you keep me going. Your company is priceless. Abby, the episodes on you were so impactful for me, thanks for opening your heart to us.
The most unreal real podcast Love all the work y’all are putting out into this world!
The Best Every episode brings a new insight to something I’m feeling, or experiencing. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda!
Soul food Thank you for the wisdom and connection. The down-to-earth honesty and reflection. The entertainment and the effort. In Liz’s words: olé olé olé
Generous and empowering Thanks for sharing and putting yourself out there!
My favourite podcast! Every episode teaches me something new about myself and the world. Thank you.
Love this pod cast❤️🙏 Keep doing this I love listening to you all.
Living woke I can not imagine what my life (and those around me ) would have being like had I being given this untamed kind of support and understanding as a young wife and mother. All I can hope for now is that women and men everywhere (hopefully those who are connected with our family ) discover the gifts of untamed ! I have 2 daughters who are living the benefits of your book and podcasts , and then of course our our therapist to enrich the experience of this life. May my descendants be blessed with our new socially constructed inner children ! We “Glennon “ many situations enjoy the investment of being woke ! Xoxo Catherine in Muskoka
WE CAN DO HARD THINGS OMG I LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!! I am definitely part of your SQUAD💕 I so looked forward to “our” “morning meetings” during the early days of Covid, this Pod cast brings it all full circle...it’s strange that someone who has anxiety brings so much calmness to her “classroom”....I love you guys...you and Abby give so much hope in so many ways💕 I can’t wait for the next Podcast...reminds me of the days of waiting every week for “Friends” to come on 😊 and then you end it with TISH & BRANDI!!! I😆I UglY CRIED 😭SO SO BEAUTIFUL! 💕🙏🏼 See ya next week!!! Sending lots of love ❤️ from Eastern 🇨🇦 ...so grateful and thankful 💕🙏🏼💕
Day Brightening Instantly brightens my day and outlook - no matter the topic!
The Ted Lasso of Podcasts Maybe? Maybe not? But this podcast paired with coffee and existential questioning is sublime. Start with a subject you’re curious about diving into and you’ll instantly be exploring them all from beginning to end. Not afraid to ask the questions and pontificate over difficult things, while somehow remaining light enough to move you on to your day. It’s funny, it’s honest. Thank you three
My sermon every week Thank you to the three of you for the work you do. This podcast is my sermon every week. Love you all!
Manners Love every podcast.  Really love the etiquette
great show, update the dressings! I love your show! Also, I want an icon and bio that includes all three of you! WE can do hard things! <3
Yep Thank youuuu for doing what you doooo!!! It’s so good to hear real people sharing their real experiences. You make me cry and feel and laugh. I thank you and I love you.
Amazing This podcast is my therapy. Every time I listen to an episode, I return to myself a little bit more!
Best best podcast I love this podcast. It fills me with joy. I send it to my friends, my family, my work colleagues. Episodes 188-190 were truly amazing and touching. My kids are queer. My husband’s parents are divorced and remarried.  It brought me to tears listening to Abby’s journey as a “bonus” or step-parent.
Hanging out with pals I love how intimate and vulnerable this podcast is 🥰 I feel like I can sit in my hard feelings as I listen. Your podcast is the ultimate companion reminding us that our darkness sustains our light, and that the right person will hold our shadows tenderly. 🧡
Love this so much Meaningful. Profound. Exploratory. Beautiful. Ground breaking. Vulnerable. Emotional. These are some of the words I would use to describe this podcast. I love it as a person in therapy and a therapist myself.
Blessings upon blessing Every single episode of this show stops me in my tracks, moves me, challenges me, encourages me, and inspires me. I am a wife, Momma, teacher, friend who is always looking to grow, learn and be an advocate in my life. This show time and time again hands me practical knowledge, resources and love to do all these things. I love this pod squad. Keep doing hard things and rainbow vomiting your love on all of us! Love you all. Jenn
Heart Warming The three Abby episodes touched me deeply. Abby, thank you for your honest vulnerability about your life and love. And your authentic emotion about the adoption had me in tears.  Ladies as per usual you rocked these episodes and brought me to a deeper understanding of what supportive inquiry looks like. I learn so much about myself every time!  Thank you.
188 to 190 Thank you. This was a profoundly moving few episodes for me. I love all your podcasts, but this, it moved me and changed me.  It opened my eyes to the true depths of emotions and fears a blended family, especially a queer blended family goes through. I am very open minded, accepting, straight, married with a son and never realized, or perhaps stopped to think about, the emotional turmoil one goes through in this situation. Thank you Abby for having the strength and courage to share. I wish everyone could listen to this podcast! Yes, we need more laws to allow everyone to define their own families with all the rights they need so they can fully love with no more fears. You three are amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
LOVE… Thank you for teaching us all how it’s done! And at the end of listening to this final episode of the trilogy, I put my phone up to my chest, closed my teary eyes and whispered , “ I love you guys so much.” Thank you for living your big and beautiful love out loud!! it feels me with the courage to be curious about how I can do the same. Sending love to all of you and your families for sharing you with all of us.  Natalie I.
Great podcast Love the hosts, love the guests! Amazing healing, empowering podcast!
Life changing This is a life changing podcast. Thank you. You’re giving us so much content - Please don’t burn out.
Breaking the ceiling with each episode You are just going further, deeper, and constantly pushing the envelope!  Thanks for sharing so much keeping me on my toes with thought provoking and insightful conversations!
Beautiful Abby episodes LOVE this podcast and especially connected to the last two episodes about Abby. Thank you so much for all that you do.
Love it - laugh, cry and feel the feels. As a step-parent I felt held and seen in your emotion about the kids wanting to adopt you officially as a parent.  Thank you for this and for every show.
Episode 188 - Hands down best episode IMO I was screaming yes, yes, yes at every question and every response on this response. It was almost as if you'll heard me ask the question and respond and decided to tape it with your voices. I felt seen in this conversation. Abby, Glennon and Amanda - thank you! 💛
Always Exactly What I Need I love how no matter what’s happening in my life Glennon Abby and Amanda show up with exactly what I need to feel just a little less lonely in a really messed up world. Whatever you have going on- there’s a pod for that. Thank you and much love.
These 3 women saved me This podcast, these 3 fierce women, EVERYTHING they have discussed and EVERYONE they have talked with have saved me.  Like when in the rooms of AA, I always hear what I need to hear.   Or it sends me down  glorious rabbit holes of discovery.  My deepest ❤️ and GRATITUDE.
Parenting neurodivergent children. Amanda … have you see the 99 posts by ‘on.the.hard.days’ Instagram account … they are so real and reassuring for parents on neurodiverse children !
Love love love I just love almost all the episodes these beautiful women have to offer!! 💖
My fav pod of all time This podcast fills me up every time. I get something valuable out of each episode and I look forward to the next one. So happy to be part of the squad ❤️
Never miss an episode I never miss an episode and always learn something and/or feel moved in some way. I try to share the wisdom and be better. I told my kids that I learned parents only do the right thing 30% of the time, and it’s the repair that’s really important. My son (19) said, ‘well you and dad are batting about 190’ (19%). Tough critic. The embarrassing stories episode where the drunk women was mistakenly diagnosed with lupus by the train ad…that day, I cried laughing. Sooo good! Stay magic! 🌟
Beautiful change Changing us individually and changing our world collectively! Go team go!
Hesitant at first and now I’m a huge fan! All I really knew about Glennon Doyle before this podcast was that she was a mom and a former Christian Blogger. Even though I kept hearing that she was talking about issues that really aligned with my interests, I was hesitant to listen because it felt like not my scene - I’m not a big follower of like Oprah or  Life Coach type stuff, etc. But I started listening and was fascinated by the insightful conversations that constantly resonated with things I was thinking about and didn’t always have space to discuss in my day to day life without being too “intense” for people - grief, death, conflict, therapy, mental health, and just how to be a person and deal with what life throws at you with grace and integrity. The podcast has been a constant companion during my maternity leave to the point that my baby now dances along with the theme music. Thanks to the whole team for this fantastic and life changing show!
5 Stars Doesn’t Even Begin This podcast should have 8000+ stars. Glennon told me to rate/review it so I did! Ive never rated anything in my life. I recommend this pod acts to everyone who will listen and then I judge them when they do not listen to it immediately.  Every episode I think it cant get better but it does. It’s hilarious, heartbreaking, thought provoking and an absolute gift. Thank you Abby, Glennon and Sister. I would not be the same without you!
A Gem From guest Gloria Steinem to no guest each episode opens my eyes and broadens my mind and heart. And I’m 73. A gem in the podcast world.
Imperfection and Truth and Humor A podcast about being human and doing better and remembering all of our life experiences are different and taking care of ourselves and our people and our communities and the world. Crying and laughing and studying and learning and loving. Just, thank you. From another goddamned cheetah.
Wise The three of you are wise, funny and insightful. I laugh every time you say if you love it give it a five star review, if you don’t, don’t worry about it, it’s fine. But all the Five stars from me!!
Podcast 178 Fantastic conversation you three!!! Loved it:)
Incredible I look forward to every episode. Absolutely love the content.
This podcast makes one think The best part is hearing women talking without shame of any emotion! Thank you
Life changing, mind-changing, question-asking, LOL-inducing content, every friggin' episode This podcasts informs my life - it makes me ask myself a lot of really important questions, and it always introduces me to brilliant minds who illuminate the darkest / toughest corners of our inner and outer worlds. A lot of the time, it's just hilarious. Somehow, they find the right balance; I've yet to listen to an epidose (out of dozens) that isn't totally relevant.  I can’t believe content this amazing exists, and I have access to it in my own kitchen. It’s crazy-good.
Love this podcast Thank you for bringing on amazing guests, and being DO HONEST about the hard stuff.
Like having three wise friends This podcast is about how to live a better life. I have listened to every single episode and they have become the highlight of my week. Such wisdom, such heart, such shared lived experiences. I’m so very thankful for this podcast and for the enlightenment these women and their guests have offered the world.
Pod #185 with Sarah Polly After listening to this podcast I wanted to run up strangers and plead them just to listen and absorb it and trust that.
I love everything! Most likely, I'm not going be adding anything new here. Glennon, Abby and sister make my day brighter. They are sensitive, willingness to go deep, and acknowledge their own privilege, and this creates a safe space, so that their listeners and guests all feel valued and supported. You are making a big difference in the lives of women, all women.
Sarah I watched Women Talking alone in my living room last night & was so happy to find your podcast with Sarah this morning! I needed to be in community in the wake of experiencing her brilliant film. Thank you for giving me that! I’m a new fan of your podcast & member of the ‘Pod Squad’.
Magic Love all three hosts equally, but the child like awe of Abby as she discovers what lies beneath unturned stones is absolute magic. Thank you - always - for your vulnerability.
Thank you. I learn something EVERY podcast. Have shared you will all my friends and family. Keep going!  We love you.
THANK YOU so so much. Thank you.
We can do Hard Things I absolutely love this show and listen to it every week. I love the authenticity of the hosts and guests on the show.  I feel like I know and could be friends with Glennon, Abby and Amanda!  Super cool and non-judgmental women!
I can’t find the words… Almost every episode brings me to tears, for bringing an understanding of myself that I didn’t even know I needed. I wish there were new words to express how safe and seen I feel when hearing these three talk about life -  with a brutal honesty I don’t often give even myself. Their depth and bravery is heart stopping.  I can’t tell you how grateful I am to have this in my life. I only wish I had had it when I was younger. Thank you!
We can do hard things ♥️🥰 My top podcast thst I come to 2x a week. A place of honesty, trust and vulnerability. I laugh, I cry and I heal with each episode. Thank you so much Glennon, Abby and Amanda for everything you do and talk about. We need this!
Warriors of life! You gals are awesome!! I listen to you all the time while I’m doggy walking .. love it! Thx so much  Love to love u 🥰🙏🏻
LOVE this pod! I love this pod. It’s so real and raw and immensely helpful. Thank you ❤️
Thank you thank you thank you ♥️♥️♥️♥️ I have never before witnessed so much love and honesty. Glennon, Abby and Sister are true friends to me. I can hear them in hard moments, telling me to remember myself and that I am not alone. Every day I am grateful to know that you 3, and the pod squad community exist. It makes life more bearable.
A Powerful and Brave Conversation I listen to every episode and learn something about myself or the world each time. This podcast has been life changing and has introduced me to the wisest women and the most powerful ideas I have ever encountered. It has renewed my hope in humanity - that we may in fact be evolving after all lol.
This is Everything Glennon, Abby and Sister feel like family to me. I absolutely love this podcast. I feel such a sense of community with the entire pod squad. Feel so grateful for every conversation. I am learning that I can do hard things.
Nourishment This podcast nourishes my soul, makes me feel less alone, and reminds me that we all share the human experience, and that comes in many forms. Thank you for existing
This podcast is… …a constant journey of learning!  I listen every week and every week I come away with so many insights.  I love all three of you.  You each bring something different and unique to the table.  Well done and Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for the learning!  Hands down my all time favourite podcast!
Medicine for the Soul Glennon, Abby, and Amanda Are such a gift. This show is perfect medicine for the soul and the mind. Thank you.
Best Podcast Ever A podcast that will change your life! I listen to episodes over and over again and wait impatiently for the new ones. This podcast feeds my soul and is helping me to human better!
We can do hard things….. ….. but listening to this podcast is beyond EASY! It’s impossible to pick a favourite episode, every single one has resonated with some part of my life. Thank you ladies for bringing joy and laughter to this world! I have more saved quotes in my notes from this podcast than from anywhere else.
All around 👌🏼 The wisdom, the openess, vulnerable real-ness it’s just the best
Obsessed I love this trio so much, listening to Glennon, Abby and Amanda is like therapy to me, they make think every episode. I also relate to Glennons “weirdness” so much ❤️
Life changing. This podcast, week after week, changes my life .. sometimes a lot and sometimes a little. But I’m eternally grateful for Glennon, sister and Abby for this gift they’ve given us. The vulnerability and openness of each guest and the wisdom that is shared will forever be so powerful. I hope it never ends as I don’t know if I’d get through my weeks without these 3 incredible humans.
Love this! Glennon! This is so good. When I listen to you I feel heard & seen. Thank you for sharing. Love you and your family! Just finished the sex episodes and they were so fantastic. So much gratitude for this. Love to all of you! My fav podcast!
THE podcast to reset your nervous system to baseline Forever grateful to Glennon, Amanda, and Abby for their wisdom, kindness, cheerleader-y-ness, honesty, humility, and transparency. I can’t express how beautiful and refreshing it is to listen to a podcast in the life-improvement domain where the hosts are actually “for” me and my wellbeing, instead of “for” leveraging my dollars and my follow to up their stats. Thank you A2+G for your genuineness and for vicariously being in my corner. I always feel supported and cared for after listening to you. ❤️
So grateful!!!!! So happy you have a podcast!! My ears were singing listening to you speak so incredibly about stuff I have been feeling my whole life- but had no idea how to articulate. Thank you for making me feel “normal” inside this wild mind of mine... you make me feel proud to just be me.. without any judgements required. Love you!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this podcasts and the hosts! This is definitely one of my favourite podcasts that I listen to every week and it would be way too hard to chose a favourite episode. I laugh at all the hosts and appreciate the different insights and perspectives that each of the women brings! Abby, Glennon and sister (Samanda) you are incredible gifts.  There was this call in episode a while back and I absolutely laugh out loud every time I think of the woman who called in saying something like “who are the helpers?” or something like that. If she ever reads this somehow, she’s amazing! Abby you have helped me understand and appreciate my husband more (also a napper and couch lover). Amanda I was totally shocked to read you’re a big flirt. I just loved how you set the boundaries around your flirting being with strangers, no one gets hurt! Glennon, you are a true beacon of light who makes everyone feel “seen”. Also, you’re super funny!   Thank you all. True gifts. ❤️
Making hard things …. seem easier … You will laugh, cry, and learn. And somehow feel more understood and less alone then  when you started listening.
Love this podcast Excellent thought provoking and informative discussions that are applicable to many of life’s challenges.
So much love to all of you! Ladies, gents, gays and they’s; This is hands down my favourite podcast. Amanda (sister, it’s a term of endearment to me it’s not reductive to a role), Abby and Glennon you honestly blow my mind and expand my horizons. The world is bigger, more expansive and more seems possible because of the work you are doing. I am so grateful for this podcast. Listening to you ladies feels like opening a window on a spring day and airing out my soul. Thank you for the work you are doing.  All my love to all of you, -Emily
So Good! Great Podcast! Y’all are wicked awesome!  ✌️❤️🔥
Life changing I absolutely adore this podcast, and every time I listen to it I learn something profound about myself. It is brilliant and has changed my life. Thank you from my heart.
Episode 177 Absolutely love this podcast and I look forward to the new episodes every week.  I have so much gratitude and admiration towards your quest for betterment, both within your selves, your community of podsquad, and globally, with your philanthropy, and I especially admire your vulnerability. I felt so triggered to be protective of Amanda on today’s episode when she shared about the email received from someone trying to be defensive & empathetic to the ex-husband.  After reading Untamed, and following this podcast show from day one, you three feel like old friends and I wish all the best for all of you. I know it’s a risk on a public platform to be subjected to negative people…I just hate the thought of it happening to any of you.  Thanks for your amazing content & contributions!
Wooo heha hooooo-ey! I laugh. I cry. I pause. I pray. I “rewind” (Don’t mind my VHS language). I replay. I journal. I release. I feel (thank you Grandma Hoover). I think (ex. can I really do this, oh that’s why I act like… x) I see (something clicks) I sit. I breathe (in stillness) I know I affirm (the knowing deep down) I share. I can (do hard things, absolutely, just try me)  Love you Squad. Thank you G., A., & Sister, guests 💕 Laura Michaluk.
My support system Thank you for being there, always.
THIS!!  *lit up* I loved this episode more than words can describe. This out to words my experience at work in a male dominant workplace where their privilege and gendered comments have come from an unkind place. I look forward to sharing this episode with my entire network- so many gold nuggets and ah ha moments. Nailed it on the head for me- I cannot wait to listen to this again!   XXOO
How to face your biggest fear This episode was SO ‘brutiful’! By the end I was fully in tears and feeling so many things. Thank you for what the three of you do each week with this podcast and for being who you are. I have listened from day one and this episode really spoke to something deep inside of me, which often happens when Amanda speaks so bravely with such honestly and vulnerability . I could listen to the three of you all day! Thanks again.
Brutiful. I relate so, so, so much to the topics, discussions and guests. This show is a source of validation for me, and an invisible force that reminds me I have, and can do hard things. Thank you for your honesty, vulnerability, openness and willingness to approach hard things with grace and humility. Keep up the good work, wish I had more friends like you, Abby and Amanda in real life.
A weighted blanket for the soul My go to podcast when it feels like everything is spinning out of control. Doing hard things is a whole lot easier because of ya’ll and the meaningful and truthful conversations about ALL the things you bring into the light. Luv ya !
Finally! I have finally found a podcast that I can’t wait to listen to!  Glad that I have so many episodes to get through.  Listening to these ladies is like sitting down for an afternoon coffee with your friends.
this makes my soul happy Glennan and everyone is amazing, this show covers such important topics with such accuracy grace and intelligence.   i listen to it nonstop!
Love Feels good in my soul
So many goosebumps! I was so thankful to listen to a recent episode. As a queer person, I love the raw and honest energy that Glennon and Abby share. I was listening to the episode about family systems theory, and so many times I got goosebumps, as the wisdom poured through these interesting minds.  So much knowledge, combined with intelligence and life experience. A beautiful equation for wisdom!
So helpful! The gentle approach and suggestions about self care are appreciated!
So great I look forward to these podcasts every week. Thank you for being so honest and real with each other and us, and for having fantastic guests every week!
Amazing guests This podcast has amazing guests. Glennon Doyle is my least favourite part of it. She is constantly interrupting her wife Abby, who often has a more relatable perspective and keener insights. If Abby ever does her own show, I would tune in, but my tolerance for Glennon is maxed out and is keeping me from being a true fan of this podcast. Glennon! Why do you have Abby on your show if you don’t honour her voice??? So cringe!
Love, love I’ve just started listening to this recently and I can’t get enough. I’m scrolling through old episodes and just listened to the ones with Cheryl Strayed. Magic. And exactly what I needed right now. I’m 52 and possibly on the brink of divorce and my 18-year-old daughter is mostly full of hostility when she isn’t ignoring me, and on many days I feel as though my dog is the only one who loves me. Honestly, life is hard. Thank you for helping me to take a deep breath, and to know I’m not alone.
I LOVE Jane Fonda (AND Glennon Doyle) 💕 I love absolutely everything you do. I didn’t think I could choose a favourite podcast episode, but Jane Fonda did it.   She’s inspiring in so many ways I could write a book. This episode resonated with me on a level that no person has ever resonated with me. Causing me to feel emotions I didn’t even know existed in my body.  When I talk about Glennon, I refer to her as a woman who I can most relate to in this world. Beyond my friends (who I adore and am so grateful for), and my family (who I appreciate every day). Beyond anyone I have ever encountered in my lifetime.  Jane and Glennon’s feelings on leaving your body is something I’ve never heard before. What I have done is write about it as it’s how I feel. My way of explaining it (only to myself) is that my mind and my body are two separate things.   Today, I understand. Today, I realize I’m not alone with this in the world. Today, I realize I can come back to my body, for the very first time in my forty six years. Your words, your inspiration, has kept me here on this earth. I’m not sure that there’s anything bigger that a person can do for another. So for that I say thank you.  Thank you for sharing the hard things. Jane Fonda is intelligent and incredible. But you too Glennon, bring so much to the world that words cannot express for me. You are a bring light.   To close, I just wanted to share how proud I am to be a god damned cheetah. Working hard, facing the hard things and getting stronger every day.  ♥️🐆♥️
Thoughtful & amazing My first podcast for your show was #165 and what a start! Brought up so many thoughts and feelings in me, I’m spinning and not even sure where to start. I want to start a new thing too, I’m a simmering pot and so many things to change. Thx for the incredible insights. Finding my next episode for my drive home.
Episode 165 Thank you, Glennon for your vulnerability in discussing your diagnosis so openly. Thank you to Abby and Amanda for their listening and support. So much respect, love and light from up here in Canada. 🥰
Raw and honest, a voice we need Love this podcast. Its so fresh to hear such honest discourse. Its realness is so refreshing for the soul. Thanks Glennon, Abby and Amanda for this beautiful podcast. Thanks for sharing your lives with us.
Thank you Listening to your podcast is so enlightening and makes me go ‘oh, that’s why!’ Thank you and please keep doing what you’re doing.❤️
Jan 3 2023 episode Thank you so much for sharing your diagnosis on today’s episode but especially for linking it to the broader systems of white supremacy / capitalist / patriarchy. There is so much learning and unlearning for everyone to do around how these systems keep us pre-occupied with how we look and tying our bodies to our value and sense of worth (and esp how language such as “wellness” has been co-opted by billion dollar industries to fool us into thinking that they care about our health). Please please please do more episodes on this!!
Refreshing Love. Thank you for this podcast.   Starting from Day one podcast release and working through them, re-listening to some the resonate with me, and journaling, talking to you three as if I’m sitting there with you, in real time.  Life is hard, and We can do hard things has been the deep, realizations of my thoughts brought to life.
Love it There are few podcasts that I look forward to. I look so forward to new episodes. I love the dynamic between these three women who are constantly breaking boundaries, working toward change within and out. They are smart and funny and yes, sometimes I don’t agree or always like everything but I love everyone. I feel like I’m with my sister and could happily jump into the conversation. I’m often laughing or smiling to myself in the gym listening. So thank you for doing and keeping on doing.
My favorite podcast!! I love the down to earth energy if this podcast. Feels like I’m hanging out with friends! And I resonate so deeply with so much of what Glennon shares. Thank you for your vulnerability <3
Life altering I love how vulnerable and open everyone is in this podcast. It always gives me a lift and I am forever now saying to myself: I CAN do hard things. Also love the music.
We Can Do Hard Things Just listened to #157 and 158. Thank you to Sarah, Glennon, Abby and Sister for this specific podcast but also for caring enough to do all of them. Sometimes your podcasts ground me like a meditation. Through depression and anxiety, my self care comes down to walking and listening to you and sometimes it is the one item in my gratitude journal. Sigmund Freud coined Keith Raniere long before Keith Raniere existed. Our wounds break us open and graft our broken parts. I call this my “living box”. It was a lesson to see what happens when we are convinced to box our pain and seal it and stick it in a dark corner of the closet so someone else determines when to open it. My “living box” helps me cope by being open within me so it serves me, not the other way round. What courage all of you women display daily. Thank you all for owning your own living boxes.
Excellent Very interesting guests.  One can feel the genuine compassion and caring of the hosts as they provide us with excellent conversation and pacing throughout each podcast.
Cultsl part one What an emotional and riveting episode The extreme power of persuasion and deceit of some people is astonishing. It just goes to show that any crazy idea can be moulded into what sounds like a reasonable one. Trusting oneself is so vital yet so hard!
We love Jane Fonda Thank you, thank you, thank you all for this glorious episode. Just perfect.
Thank you Love listening to your podcasts - so honest, touching and humorous all the same time. Just listening to the 3 hacks for Christmas and so glad to hear everything I’ve felt for years being discussed openly. Makes me feel not alone 🥰
Great content! This show is so very helpful to anyone who feels vulnerable. The hosts not only make us feel like we aren’t alone in our struggles, but they provide us with wonderfully accessible strategies to cope and or heal. Thank you for doing this!! Oh, and please go back to playing the full song at the end 😁🤞 it’s a beautiful song.
Brilliant Absolutely love this podcast!!
Not a Hard Thing IT is NOT hard to listen to this podcast. I absolutely love the challenging topics, because many of them are examining the hard things in my own life that I do not and have not talked about to anyone. I have been left in tears many, many times just knowing that the strange and uncomfortable ways I don’t fit into society’s norms (now there’s an oxymoron), are NOT unique to me. Thank you for your vulnerability, truth telling, and for explaining that you are NOT here to give answers. You are here simply to explore the strange and hard things in life with eyes wide open. You are changing the hearts of people. Don’t stop.
Thank you. I am gobsmacked by the thoughtful, caring, serious, humorous, and intelligent way you three discuss the most important issues facing us today. I learn something every single time I listen. I share these podcasts with my husband, who is also in awe of your incredible ability to speak about truths in our society. I am so proud to call myself a “podsquader”. Thank you. My life is so much better, and I am recognizing my own power with every podcast I listen to.  If you have never listened to WE CAN DO HARD THINGS, I urge you to give it a shot. You will not be sorry.
The podcast that never was The most recent episode, about “the podcast that never was”, is to me the best so far. Hearing the three hosts process in “real time” a common but disturbing relatable thing, and the example of the team member who sent the very important text message, will stay with me the next time I find myself in that situation (no spoilers). if you need to feel a tiny bit better about how the world is changing, give this one a listen.
We Can Do Hard Things Glennon. Abbey, and Amanda…thank you! I’ve been listening to you everyday on my way to and from work, and I cannot tell you how much all of your stories resonate with me. You make me laugh and cry and I feel so light when I hear the song and your voices. I’m going through a rough patch, and numbing with alcohol and technology isn’t helping. I do the same thing everyday and know what to do, just not how to do it. I’m scared, but I feel like everyday I listen I’m one step closer to moving into my life again. I just want to tell you that I appreciate your stories and my goal is to break free and become in control of my life again, just like you have all done.❤️
Codependency The episode on codependency was amazing…to know that we all experience it and it’s partly what makes us human was powerful.  You know I’m a huge fan of the show when I’m singing along to the song by Tish and Brandi at the end.
Fantastic! Really love this pod!!  Keep up the great work that you do 🙏🏼!!
100 / 10 Just wow. These two are a dream team of open conversations. Would HIGHLY recommend this podcast, for anyone. Take a walk and pop your ear buds in! Very eye opening, educational and endless laughs!
The best I love you and everything on this podcast. Thank you for being you.
Quite Great Showing us different tools when we get tired of using our hands. Life’s a garden: Dig it
My favourite podcast and often favourite hour of my week :) Love this pod! Always bringing amazing guests in and discussing topics that make a difference. I always walk away having gained something as well as had a laugh. Thank you!
Stellar podcast Glennon, Abby, and Amanda (Sister) talk openly about really hard stuff - mental health issues, addiction, divorce, parenting - in a way that’s both enlightening and down-to-earth. Sometimes when I find myself in a difficult situation, I find myself repeating to myself: “We can do hard things. We do hard things!” I so look forward to every Tuesday and Thursday for new episodes. Highly, highly recommend.
Awakening with Cole Arthur Riley Thank you for the very good podcast with Cole Arthur Riley!
INDIGO GIRLS!!! Thank you for this episode that happened to be released on my birthday! After listening to the podcast I sat on my chair and listened for hours! So great to reacquaint myself with such powerful music and such great lyrics! You are both so good with words! And such great harmonies! It’s all so great! Love everything about this.  “Secure yourself to heaven hold on tight the night has come. Fasten all your earthly burdens. You have just begun. “
Episode 130 with Dr. Becky Thank you for this episode, I found it extremely helpful. I’ve already downloaded the good Doctor’s book. My wife passed away tragically in mid-2020, and I’m raising a now- 7 year old daughter solo.  There was just so much value for me in hearing this episode today. I was happy to recognize that I have done, intuitively, a couple of the techniques discussed in the episode. Your closing piece of advice, and repeating it out loud, really helped heal a part of me that I’ve been struggling with since my wife died. It’s my new mantra ❤️🙏🏻 thank you
Love love love these ladies Thank you so much for all you are doing. I’m learning so much. I’m just discovering that I can set boundaries at 46 years old. I’m so enjoying just allowing myself to take the time to listen, so much of the content speaks to me on so many levels. Loved hearing from Dr Becky, so helpful in understanding my relationship with my three teens. Just thank you x
Too good I wish everyone would listen to your podcasts You’re changing the conversation and I’m here for it Thank you  Not sure why I never sent the above comment but once again, Episode 130 with Doctor Becky should be required listening for all! Thank you from my daughters and grandchildren also ❤️
IFS Hey ya’ll - I felt so excited listening to this episode. I’ve recently been introduced to IFS (Internal Family Systems) Dr. Richard Schwartz and his book No Bad Parts! Brilliant… highly recommend.
Can’t wait to exercise After spending way too long sitting around, I’m getting going on a walking program. It’s going well because this podcast is my treat, and I can’t wait to walk again so I can listen to another episode. I am laughing and crying along the way. Such wonderful guests with amazing information and insights to open minds and hearts. Thank you so much for this hard thing you do every week x 2!
Honest, Tender, Inspiring I love this podcast. It is about real issues, often those that nobody wants to talk about honestly. It inspires me, makes me laugh, cry and hope. I highly recommend it.
LOVE YOUR PODCAST! I love your podcast. Almost every episode speaks to me and empowers me in either a small or big way to do something different. LOVED the episode on boundaries and the one where sister KILLED IT on reimagining acts of service. Wow. Blessings to you all!!
thank you thank you for giving me a space to come home to when i’m feeling lost ♥️
Inspiring Such an inspirational podcast. You talk about the hard things that we are all doing !  And yes we can do hard things, but for me, as women we need to hear this. And listen to amazing podcasts like this   God knows why we can see and believe this on our own, but most of us can’t. So I am thankful and so grateful to you , for having these amazing people speak,  for us to listen and hear;  this amazing message!!  Thank you ♥️
Less alone This podcast makes me feel seen! It makes me feel less ashamed and less defective. When Glennon talks about her struggles, I so relate, and it’s like I’m no longer alone in this life! Her honesty makes me feel way more ok with myself! It’s hard to explain how much these talks mean to me! It’s like church, except better! Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all three of you for all your vulnerability, honesty and laughter, and for making the world a less pretentious place!  I consider you my soul friends ❤️!
Life Changing. If you are looking to expand your horizons and get to know yourselves a little deeper, take the time to listen. I promise you will not be disappointed. The ways in which I get to connect and reflect on the beautiful language used, is just so special. After bawling my eyes out with mixed emotions, episode 86 with Jenhatmaker, was life changing. Thank you for being my safe space and understanding the trauma I lived through. I’ve gotten this far, now, I promise to be my best self and rebuild. Sister, G and Abbey, you are doing wonderful things and saving so many lives 💜
Episode 125 Remarkable, Mind Blowingly Affirming So much in this episode. Thank you for such an affirming and thought provoking conversation. Amazing. So so many important points for women to consider in a union and as a mother.
These ladies are genuine, vulnerable and relatable I’ve been listening to this podcast for about a year and every episode is so impactful and moving. Glennon, Abby and Amanda are genuinely transparent, vulnerable and honest about all their experiences and it’s refreshing. I feel so much like Glennon a lot of the time and appreciate and respect her self awareness. She’s become a role model for me.  Every episode feels like an adventure but also relatable, as their topics are simply the hard things we all experience.  I’ve now also read “Untamed” because of my love of this podcast and am inspired every time I listen.
Finally a womens podcast that works for me I have been looking for a good podcast that addresses womens issues and doesnt include religion or sales. This is the best I have found so far. I feel seen heard and I am learning important stuff. THANK YOU Glennon Doyle. We need you!!
Laughter heals One of my top 3 podcasts.  I feel like I’m a part of the tribe. Laugh out loud each episode.  Always great insights and advice from everyone, so good!!
I’m in love This podcast does more for me than I ever thought possible. It’s the perfect, soulful mix of laughter, epiphanies, validation and just overall mind-expanding loveliness.
🙏 This group of women are so lively and engaging and smart and imminently relatable.  I feel so much more connected to the kinds of conversations that I NEED through their talks. This podcast sustains and uplifts me and is nothing less then life affirming.  Never leave us. The truth leaps through the podcast and shakes me to my core. Bravo you goddesses. You are changing the world. ❤️
Priceless This podcast is a gift. A true Gift of authenticity, vulnerability and integrity wrapped in infinite Love. A Gift for the soul which makes you richer beyond measures. Absolutely love it. Greatful and blessed.
Girl Friends I don’t have any really close girlfriends, if any at all. I have been listening to your podcast on and off for the past while and it is through tears that I have so much gratitude for feeling like I have girlfriends when I listen to your podcast. Thank you and I love you all.💗💗💗
♥️ These amazing women, are warriors of truth. They spread light and love. They acknowledge the real life challenges in life and put things into motion. You humans are incredibly loved by many perfect strangers. Thank you for being strong enough to have found your voice and putting that into action by sharing.♥️
Real and heartfelt Thank you for your inspiring words, honest and real and vulnerable! Loved listening to interview with Chase Melton and Ocean Vuong
Greatest podcast of all time <3 This podcast saved me when I was struggling so deeply after recently leaving my wife, my home, and my life. I had no idea who I was anymore as I had given so much and changed so much of myself to be the “perfect” wife. I moved to a new city and didn’t know anyone. To feel less alone, I started walking around my neighbourhood. Just to be around other people gave me a tiny bit of relief. That’s when I started listening to podcasts and stumbled upon this one. I am and will forever be so grateful to these wonderful humans for creating such a beautiful platform that helped me find myself, my truest self, for the first time of my life. XO
Obsessed 🙌 So grateful for every episode you beautiful humans are creating. I’m learning new things about myself, my relationships, and this world we live in. Thank you 🙏
My fav I listen to this podcast every day at work. It keeps me going through a job that feels like a daily trudge. Thanks so much all of you.
The Best Glennon, Abby and Sissy are the best. They talk about hard things with ease. I love that they admit their mistakes and struggles. This makes them so relatable. You guys are the best. Thanks for helping me grow!!!!
Whole body yes This makes my day! Some joy Eve. On difficult days :) thank you!
Always time well spent Regardless of the subject, every episode of We Can Do Hard Things adds something to my life. Sometimes it's new information or a fresh perspective, other times I come away more determined or simply joyful. Thank you for talking about the hard things and bringing diverse voices to your platform. And special shoutout to Tish for a theme song that can wring the tears out of me every time. ❤️
Just wow, you mean I’m not the only one?! Read and loved her book awhile ago and just found the podcast- such great sisterhood support and I’m starting to feel less ‘odd one’  Started with overwhelm through an accidental thumb (which skipped over the others in my que) and now listening to self care all I can say I thank you for this.   Being heard at exactly the right time, thank you for creating this C
Abortion I have been listening to and enjoying all the We Can Do Hard Things episodes since you started. I also love Tish’s song. I could comment on various episodes but haven’t bothered until now. Just listened to Amanda’s solo presentation on the fall of Roe. It was incredibly informative in terms of reviewing the legal and historical aspects of this terrible situation. But what I appreciated the most was her clear call for action. Her compelling argument that all the “walls” need to be built and sustained in order to address American women’s safe access to abortion was excellent. Without a broad intersectional approach to human rights no one will win. I hope Amanda you will stay in the forefront of this fight. You have what it takes as a leader.  Also want to commend you Glennon, Abby and Amanda on your foundation and the important work you do.  Finally, as a Canadian, one of many who listen to you and share your values and hopes for our children and grandchildren ‘s future, I know we need to work together across borders. We cannot afford to be complacent here either.
Hope where there was none Amanda I thank you for your brave solo podcast. It was a much needed knot at the end of my rope. Stunningly good 🙏
This podcast is everything I was called to read Untamed by the beautiful mess and sparkles on the front page and I AM SO GLAD I DID. I am currently walking through some incredibly hard things, and as a therapist it can be difficult to priories my own rest and recovery while also balancing the needs of so many. When the book was over I turned to the podcast and 10 episodes in, I am so eager to hear more. Glennon,  I’ve used your strength, and character as inspiration and encouragement for my clients. Your book now sits in our waiting room and on our website resource list to remind everyone that they too can do hard things.
The absolute best! I have never been so inspired by and engaged in a podcast before! I truly feel like this is my warm place. I listen, I laugh, I cry and then I can go On. I feel like you say things that need to be said and engage in conversations that we all need to have. My life is better with the three of you in it! 💕💕💕thank you!
Hope These are the conversations that women are truly interested in, and it’s very important to see them here on this platform. Thank you. There are so many fantastic episodes, but the most recent one with Shannon Watts from Moms Demand Action was exactly what I needed to hear this week after the school shooting in Uvalde TX. It’s easy to forget how much of an impact we can each have through conversation and simple actions, so thank you all for that reminder. ❤️
Taking back my power Thank you. Thank you for your vulnerability, sharing your truth and reaffirming my gut instinct. I started listening to your podcast from E1 and I’m absolutely hooked. I too am a recovering alcoholic, anxiety pro and a lost soul searching for my joy.  I needed your voice along with Sister and Abby. Again, Thank you.
Thank you! So relevant and inspiring! Thank you!! And thank you so much for bringing in Liz Gilbert, she rocks! You all are awesome strong beautiful and courageous womyn! Love yous and thanks 💪💖❤️
Best podcast ever I can’t say enough things about this amazing podcast. Thank you, thank you Glennon, Sister and Abby for allowing us to listen to these important and meaningful conversations. The episode with Liz Gilbert is the best one yet. For Liz to share her story so beautifully, it felt like an honour to listen to. I am eagerly awaiting her to come back.
I am in love This podcast has helped me fall in love with myself in a way I did not know was possible. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Sister. You are earth angels, truly.
Double Date with Brene and Barrett Best podcast I have ever listened to.  I laughed, I cried, I related….I healed.  Thank you so much for all the work you do.
Finally! My people I recently listened to an episode in which Glennon spoke about being a non- sunny person in a wanna-be-sunny world. ☺️ And FINALLY I felt like I belonged. I have always been the MEH. I have always felt great injustice at the state of the world. I am full of angst and doubt and questions and believe that laughy-smiley people are the most suspicious people on the planet. WHAT are you laughing at? All day. Every day. How can that be genuine? My glass is half full but yet, I am not thirsty. I am feeling. I have 20/20 vision. I believe that my sensitivity is because I feel ALL the stuff. Especially the crappy stuff. And listening to that podcast and the relation between beautiful music and tears and how feeling the ugliness of the world is actually gorgeous - well. Thank you. As I listened I could feel myself settle into my bones and it was good. THIS is who I am. And it’s A-OK.  Love you all. Xoxoox Jules
Men are untaming, too I wish I had adequate words to express how much I love your podcasts. (I could paint or play something on my harp that would get close, but Apple won’t let me do that…) Anyway, I wanted to let you know that there are men out here hanging on your every beautiful, painful, joyful word and are soooo ready for you to finally smash the patriarchy! Keep doing your soulful work, however it evolves.
Thought provoking and heartfelt I love listening to this podcast because they explore topics many of us live with and do not take the time to discuss. I enjoy hearing the input and reflections from all hosts; Abby, Amanda and Glennon. I am also loving the double date episodes. Feels so good to have lesbian couples represent! Much needed. Thank you :)
Made with care and holistic love This show shares relatable personal growth, narratives and tales of personal experience, couple and family life, interviews sharing all kinds of perspectives, sensibly and elegantly normalizes LGBTQ2A experiences
Love this!! This podcast is amazing! I just started listening. I have heard episode 68,74&75 so far. I absolutely loved “Untamed” I have listened to it twice on Audible and I am so excited for the show to start! I have been on my own journey of healing and self-discovery these past few years and have had some transformative moments and epiphanies. Listening to your words and resonating so much with them has really given me hope, comfort and guidance. For this I thank you!
Smiling thanks I started listening a few months ago and so so love all Of you and your podcast. I was rip your face off kinda perimenopausal angry and exhausted the last 2 days - listened to Pet Peeves while Walking the dog just now and laughed and grinned my face off the whole time! Thanks so much you always bring something fantastic to my day as I listen. And yes cleaning the sink of food gunk is essential!!!! Sometimes the fam here don’t have even empty dirty gross dishwater lol yuck!!! Thanks so much 💙 Christy
You. Are. My. Mind. When I listen to you speak, I feel like you are reading from the script of my own brain. I am so grateful for how openly and honestly you speak about all the things.  I spent most of my life hiding who I was and playing my role because I felt I was too much and was continually told I was too sensitive. I want to live my second half of life as a fully authentic human and you inspire me to keep living life this way even if there will be people who don’t understand it.
Poetry I love this show  . When I first found it I binge listened to all of the shows ,  Every Single episode had a gem, a take away that I felt was there just for me it’s uplifting encouraging and hopeful
Strength and power This podcast has changed my life. After leaving an abusive marriage after 15 years in order to protect my daughter and myself I felt like I would never be able to find myself again or rebuild my own strength and power. Staying would have been hard and leaving was hard but I needed to pick the right hard to preserve what was left of myself and show my daughter that abuse is not ok. Now we always say to each other, let’s do hard things together.  Listening to G, sister Amanda, and Abby has helped me find my own power and strength and has brought some light, hope, and solidarity into my life, maybe for the first time. It has definitely helped me to feel less alone in my deep thoughts and feelings. Love you! Let’s keep doing hard things together!
A loving, raw, punch-ish, incredibly beautiful sharing Just listened the first episode. I choose “My Hardest Thing”, and I felt like I was there with them in their couch and in their hiking as well. You said: “I only have words” but it is beyond words my dear. For me, it was like a traveling by a train with hard,  painful stops, AND being able to see the beauty outside the window during the journey. Thank you and may you keep walking up the stairs with loving steps.
Misophonia and/or ADHD Have you ever considered you have ADHD?   I was recently diagnosed in my mid-30s and so many things sound the same and then your pet peeves description is exactly how I feel.
Episode 55 season 1 blew my mind! Episode 55 season 1 blew my mind!
Love this podcasts Love your podcasts!  I so enjoy listening to the 3 of you❤️ Thank you for helping me discover more about myself, my feelings and understanding that I can do hard things. XO
Connection I love the conversations on life, the little things that get us and doing hard things! It feels like talking with friends in a time when connections are sparse this is precious! Thanks!
Martha Beck interview !!!! This podcast is my DRUG!!  Oh my gosh the episode with Martha Beck is my very very favourite!!! I could relate to sooo much Martha said!!!  Being raised Mennonite, I too followed my wild, leaving my spouse and entire community with just my four small children in tow. No post HS education or career, I started a new life at the age of 29. THEN! Just a few years later I had to leave an abusive husband and start again. My cheetah heart HATED the jobs I had to do to survive and provide for my family. I had my dark night of the soul, extreme suffering, suicidal, depression…you name it. I used to pray that God would let me die. But I refused to pretend anymore. I started to paint. And the Light came in and the magic took over my life! Now I am a FT artist while I finish my marathon of parenting and I have never been happier!!!  Thank you for giving us permission to SAY WHAT WE HATE! I needed to be able to voice that before I could see any light.  Thank you thank you for these amazing vulnerable words of wisdom. You all are such a joy and you are like salve to our burning hearts. You will never know what a difference you make. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!♥️ Roxanne Willems - Canada 🇨🇦
My absolute favourite podcast Episode 63. When you talk about working inside a closet. OMG I feel so much better about who I am hahaha I’ve recorded all my meditation and video voice overs inside my bedroom closet and my husband is just use to it now, But at first he thought I was crazy and I kinda did also. The sound quality is unbeatable and if i had to pick one room that felt like a hug, it’s my closet lol  I love you guys so much. Thanks for being amazing ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I feel seen and heard Glennon, Amanda, and Abby have wonderful insights and I always enjoy their conversations. They never shy away from saying hard things that need to be said or calling each other out when it needs to be done and saying their personal truths.  My only critique is that Amanda doesn’t seem to get the credit she deserves for her brilliance; because Amanda is brilliant.
Like virtual BFFs I have always enjoyed Glennon’s books, then her “morning meetings” on social, and of course Abby too. THEN this podcast allows us to hear sister and Abby along with Glennon, their amazing insight and varying perspectives on things and their honesty is so amazing. At a time when the world is dealing with a pandemic and personally my circle has become very small it’s amazing to feel like I’m sitting around listening to my virtual BFF’s chat about life’s things, fills my cup, I’m so grateful a podcast with all three together is what evolved from Glennon’s desire to connect.
Always a relief to listen to My favourite podcast. Love the dynamic between Glennon, Amanda and Abby. They always have the most insightful thoughts on the pod squads’ Q’s but never any answers. So real, relatable and honest!
Fave podcast ever Authentic and honest. I love the balance of intellectual conversation and practical action. Also highly appreciate Glennon’s nuanced understanding of mental health and the need for appropriate medical advice in addition to self care measures.
Personal Highlight of 2021 and motivation for 2022 Life has not been easy these past few years with our global pandemic and everything that brought to our family. But regardless I wanted to reflect on what did shine through for me this past year. (And by no means do I desire a shiny life, lol, let’s be truthful ). But big gratitude goes to keeping my family’s physical and mental well being together, that was a serious journey ; and no joke my Peleton for keeping me moving and inspired; working towards establishing more workshops on intuitive painting and creating community through compassionate art making; and last but not least this podcast! The truth and sincerity you all bring to your pod squad has been inspiring and validating for so many people locked away in their studio/home/car wherever. I have never provided a review before for a podcast but wanted to give you a special shout out to simply say, thank you. 🙏
Wow from Canada Hello! Just found you gals tonight for the first time! Thank you so much for your honesty and truth.  Speaking from the heart is where I talk from but nothing like you gals.  Thank you so much!!
Friendship is a Verb I LOVE this line - so true - it’s not always easy to be a good friend. I just started listening in a few weeks ago and am reading Untamed.  It’s inspiring and Fresh ~ thank you for living your truth.
Always waiting for Tuesday! I Love listening to G, Amanda and Abby… they make me laugh out loud, understand myself and the world around me, sometimes cry, but always feel like I’ve found my tribe. Thank you all for your transparency and love. My only wish is that you would do more! Alison
Like time with your favourite smart, weird friends. I try to choose friends who make me think in new ways, who make me laugh and who can be exactly who they are and know they are safe and worthy of love. These ladies are the friends I’ve never met.
Amazing! So many relatable and brutaful (brutal + beautiful) truths are discussed in a way that makes you feel less alone as you navigate all of life’s hard things.
Refreshing, easy to listen to & honest The dynamic between these three ladies makes you feel like you are right there beside them. It’s somehow deep and heavy and yet light at the same time. Their honestly and vulnerability is refreshing. 5 stars for me!
The Doyle sisters + Kate Bowler The podcasts with Kate Bowler are my favourite podcasts I've ever listened to...not just favourite out of WCDHT podcasts but of any podcast ever.  Thank you!
Excellent podcast Months into this wonderful podcast I am amazed & appreciative of the wide range of topics & honest discussions that continue to help me deal with every day challenges. Thank you.
Top top top podcast! I listen to A LOT of podcasts and this is the first one that is truly fun, enlightening, interesting, makes me laugh, connect and resonate with the insights raised. I started to binge and look forward to each episode!
My favourite!! I look forward to hearing Glennon, Abby, and Amanda every week. You three are just doing it right. Thank you ❤️❤️
Love What the world needs 🧡
LOVE! This podcast is my heart and soul in words spoken back to me by 3 incredibly powerful beings and their amazing guests, and they show me, through all of my f@cked up humanity and perceived shortcomings….I’m powerful and worthy.  And Glennon, Abby and Amanda make me laugh and cry in every single episode and that’s my love language so I feel like my heart is home.  And Tish’s song is the anthem of my soul.  So anyway…..
Hilarious yet deep I laugh out loud quite often, I am also moved to tears and have to pause the pod in order to write down something that resonated with me. Absolutely love Glennon, Amanda and Abby and their varied viewpoints.
Try it out, it’s so worth it! Simply the best podcast out there… Listening to this podcast twice weekly, will make you a better person towards yourself, to the ones you love around you and to the world out there. You will probably cry, laugh and nod excessively in approval of everything they say - it’s just never been said out loud in a « normal » daily life setting. You might find yourself searching for real friends like Glennon, sister and Abby, which is impossible… so stick to the podcast instead!
The Best! Thought provoking and affirming beliefs in every episode! Real, relatable, honest, raw, witty, and undeniably authentic. 💛
Loss of words This is the only podcast that I’ve listened to every episode. It’s like Christmas twice a week. I never know what I’m going to get but I always love it.
Love! I love love love this podcast. It’s the therapy I need but can’t afford to pay for. Love you guys!
I love Glennon sister and abbey She is the most authentic real author I’ve ever bought a book from. You have allowed me to find my wild again. Thank you for untamed it has changed my life! I have come out since untamed and I wanted to thank you 😊 you are the highlight of my week and I always look forward to hear your voices on my way to work
Love love love! Want to share this with all the people I love and the people they love.
Good for the Soul Every episode I’ve listened to, I seem to end up in tears because I feel so heard. I look forward to every single episode!
Episode 50! A Hell yes to another live group podsquaders! Can we go back to OMEGA?!?! You have saved me and us!!! So thankful for this podcast! Hearing your voices and listening to your vulnerabilities and hard and easy things...brings me back to the beginning when Glennon first entered my life at the perfect time when I left 'A Psychiatric Hospital' for Depression, Anxiety and an Eating Disorder watched your Ted Talk 'What I learned at the Mental Hospital' and you felt like home... to Carry on Warrior..Love Warrior, Then meeting you all at 'OMEGA', then Untamed, then the journal and the live event, like COME ON can it get any better, and it does, every damn week these incredible podcasts...the connection even long distance and virtually is so so special, it just fills my bucket! I am beyond grateful for Glennon, Sister-Amanda, and Abby ❤️ You all have a special place in my heart!! A Tish and her beautiful  voice and song! Love Chantele from Canada 🇨🇦
Love Island I love this podcast - so vulnerable, relatable and insightful. This latest episode with Craig is amazing. The effort you’ve all put into operating like mature, forgiving, loving adults with your children’s needs as your top priority is healing to witness. Wonderful to watch love winning because real, flawed people keep saying yes to growth. I am falling in love with everyone on your island and the purity in of your daughters voice moves me every time.
Holiday hacks You all are the best, the best, just THE BEST!! Thank you for giving me 3 hacks and 300 laughs! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love.Love.Love I adore this podcast. I listen twice a week and sometimes re-listen to an episode if I need a pep-talk on a particularly hard day. Abby, Glennon & Sister, thank you for putting yourselves and your words of wisdom out into the world.
Abby’s Marathon Experience I love your podcast but I was afraid to listen to this episode because I thought I would bawl my eyes out. And I was right.   I ran the Washington Marine Corps marathon in 2004 and this episode brought back all the feelings.  As Abby said, physically it was the hardest thing I have ever done.   I am not an athlete - my time was about an hour longer than yours, Abby.  I felt everything you felt over those 26 miles - a roller coaster of emotions.  And what got me through it was the thought that if I didn’t finish it I would feel like I had to do another one, and at that point that is the last thing I wanted to do.   What Glennon said about the cheerers is so true - hearing someone call my name and cheer me on was the best feeling and put a spring back in my step.  Shalane said that when you find out that someone has run a marathon, you think okay, I get you.  That is so true.  I feel like we are all connected somehow, even though we are all different.   I can no longer run for various reasons and I miss it so much.  Now I walk instead, which is okay but not quite the same.  Congratulations, Abby.  Keep wearing your medal :)
Feels like family I lived most of my life feeling like the black sheep of my family. I had different views and a different voice. After many years of feeling unseen and unheard, I finally found a family who speaks the same language - the language of love. Glennon, Amanda and Abby, you are the family I always hoped for. So grateful for your love, laughter, and insights. We can do hard things. And the hard things feel less hard when we do them together. ❤️
Thanks for helping me heal!! In 2020 I finally left alcoholic husband of nearly 23 and 38 years together. We were high school sweethearts. I had enough. I wasn’t going to be his doormat anymore. I learned I could and I did do hard things!! It was the hardest thing I ever did. It was heartbreaking leaving someone I still loved but I had to go so I could survive. My kids and I are so much better now. It was terrifying  especially financially but I had to do it!   I’m finally free!!   Listening to Glennon, Abby and Amanda has helped me appreciate and celebrate my decision to leave. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! ❤️❤️‍🩹
Every episode heals, inspires, teaches - THANK YOU! Glennon, Abby, Amanda - I love and appreciate you so much! Thank you for making the world a kinder, more loving, more understanding place!  Every episode, helps me heal and grow - and laugh! Thank you!   I just finished listening to your interview with Gabrielle Union and WOW!!! She is amazing! I love and appreciate everything she said and stands for!  And what you all said about how hope can hurt us is so true in my life too. It was when I gave up hope, as a 19 year old, that I would “get better” from my debilitating chronic illness and stopped living in desperation of healing, that I was able to find joy and happiness. I decided to accept my sick body and stop believing I needed to be healed to be happy. Thirty years later, I am still living with a sick and broken body, but I have had an amazing, beautiful, joyful life!
This Trio is in Fire - I pounded the 5 stars! Such an amazing trio! So happy Abby has stayed on board!  Glennon cracks me up just as much as she inspires me!  I am a huge introvert and have struggles with anxiety, so I often can relate lot of things she says!  All three women have such amazing insight on life.  💕
Soul Food warmly wrapped in Truth and Sisterhood This podcast speaks straight to my heart and fills my truth bucket to overflowing. I am so grateful for the wisdom, openness, and willingness to share at such a personal and very HUMAN level. This world is a hard place and yes, with a little (or may lot!?!) of help like this, I can too “do hard things”. Sending so much love and gratitude to these amazing sisters XOXO
The only one The only podcast I tune in for every. single. week.
My favourite Podcast ever! I LOVE this Podcast! I look forward to every episode and literally LOL or cry (or both) to most! I have forwarded episodes to friends and family when the topic made me think of them. Forwarded one to my sister in law and she was already reading Untamed! I’ve even had my husband listen to a few. Today I told him of something we were going to change and told him he could thank Glennon! 😊  I love Abby (I am Abby in many ways) and really love Sisters knowledge and analogy’s. Thank you for helping me to pay attention to my inner thoughts and feelings rather than pushing them back down. I wish I found you 20 years ago! I have listened to Untamed once already and starting it again soon. I also listen to the Podcasts at least twice - there is usually so much information I want to be sure I absorb it all. ❤️
Refreshingly honest - makes hard things feel easier! Glennon, Amanda and Abby regularly say things in a way that rings so honest and true with my experiences that I cannot help but shout “Yes!” What a wonderful gift this podcast is during such challenging times in the world. I feel much less alone when tackling my own hard things.
My self care Love love love this podcast! From the realness to the sense of humour and all the raw topics discussed, this podcast has become part of my self care - a place I feel like I’m with my people. Thank you Glennon, Sister, and Abby for showing up. My sensitive, big feelings, human self drinks you all in and you soothe my soul.
Thought provoking, informative, relatable and funny I am in a phase of life where I am “dripping with children” and over the years I have forgotten how to be me. I have lost touch with what I like and don’t like and most importantly what I NEED. Listening to this podcast has helped me remember that I am a person to, with wants and needs and desires! I love what each host contributes to the topic. Listening to Abby, Glennon and Amanda has helped me laugh out loud on a hard day, cry when I need to and give me the courage to start making the journey back to myself. I look forward to listening to the podcast every week, no matter the topic. Thank you all for taking the time to create this amazing community.
My first ever review I never review, but really felt like I had to. I’ve just listened to one episode - the very first one and instantly fell in love with Glennon. Can you just imagine what it feels like to be loved by her? I can! I felt this visceral hug coming through her words and instantly felt uplifted in the first 2 minutes. Then I keep going and hear her wisdom and heart. I haven’t read her book(s?) yet, but Thank you Amazon prime. I’m excited for what can happen in my life with Glennon in it. Ps. That song is so beautiful and powerful!
Good, important, hard work! I love this podcast! Even if the topic is something I feel I already know about (having read all of Glennon’s books, and her blog since the early days, and because I am SO wise at age 53), I ALWAYS hear at least one idea/comment/explanation that makes me go ‘Ah HA!’ You three make me laugh and you make me cry and I look forward to each new episode. Keep up the good, IMPORTANT, hard work. I am grateful and I love you all.  P.S. Tish’s song at the end makes me sob EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
Thank you! Thank you for talking about, encouraging us and doing the hard things. Your books and this podcast have changed my life. I rely on the weekly chats to lift me up.
Mental Health Stimulation Like curling up in your living room with your closest friends and having that much needed (and often long awaited!) catch-up.
This is my self-care Taking the time to listen and reflect is something I so look forward to now. I’m so glad I found this.
I can do hard things This podcast is my favourite!  Glennon, Amanda and Abby have such a great dynamic. I have learned so much from listening even when I think I’m not interested in a topic. Love their perspective on everything. Thank you for speaking out and being so brave.
This podcast is everything. I count the days until each podcast episode comes out… I love all 3 of these beautiful humans, their stories and realness are such gifts. Thank you for giving me something to look forward to every week💜
Love it. I love this podcast. I never realized how much other podcasts focused on improving — learning more, being better, doing more — until I started listening to this one regularly. Glennon, Amanda, and Abby come together in a way that invite us to be in the messiness of our lives. There is less problem-solving and more acknowledging of the experience of being human. I am very grateful for everything that this podcast is. Thank you to everyone involved in making it possible. ❤️
All my thoughts and feelings told back to me I have never been one to listen to podcasts much. This one, I never miss and actually look forward to. So glad it’s twice weekly now. It’s a comfortable pause in my work from home days and it feels like I’m chatting with like-minded friends.
Changed everything This podcast changed everything for me. And I now know others who think like me!!!  Look forward to every week!!
Favourite podcast of all time Hands down, my favourite podcast there is. I love everything Glennon does and have also loved hearing more from SisterAmanda and Abby. They’re so real, raw and relatable. Thank you for your energy.
Simply wonderful Please never stop doing this podcast. Everything you incredible humans say actually soothes me right to my soul, you communicate the thoughts and feelings that I don’t have the knowledge and bravery to say, you are so comforting and relatable and I just feel such good female energy from this show!!!! 💕💛🌈✨
So real, so honest, so inspiring Very grateful to Glennon, Amanda and Abby for discussing hard things. You balance each other so well and each of you bring an enlightening perspective to the podcast. Keep it up team! It’s like a weekly epiphany session for me. 🙏🏻👍🏻😊
The best I feel so much of what Glennon is saying, she makes me feel so heard and I can’t imagine my weeks without this chat. Thanks so much folks ❤️💚
Thank you!! I listen to these pod casts every morning! Thank you thank you thank you for being so open and raw in sharing your hard things! I have a daughter that has anxiety and depression, so when I was listening to your first one I turned it up and made sure she was in “ear shot” she came out of her room and said “Preach sister!” The smile on her face to hear someone speaking to her hard truth! There is not enough tools out there to help people that deal with mental illness and to see you tackle it full on, and to hear how Abby loves you through it gives us all hope! I am a bi-sexual woman who has been shamed for loving woman, my oldest daughter left home at 17 to move onto university and has never lived at home after that (27 now and married) I left my career I loved and started over because 10 hrs away was not ok for me, so now in my 50’s starting to rebuild relationships and a career, these are my hard things!
Love love love I love this podcast so much. I get so much strength from the ‘WE’ can do hard things. I thought Untamed truly changed my ideas and how I see things. So much live to my 3 favourite PEOPLE: Glennon, Abby and Sister 🧡🧡🧡
❤️❤️❤️ I love these podcasts! I squealed when you all announced you would be doing two a week. Thank you for validating so many feelings we all carry around on the daily. Many conversations I have now start with the thought of “what would Glennon say?” Thank you!
Makes everyone smile! This is the best podcast ever!! My brain, heart and soul overfloweth! I usually listen on my morning walk and I didn’t realize how much I was smiling while listening until I noticed how many people were greeting me with smiles as I passed them by! You are spreading so much joy, even if some is kind of accidental lol! Thank you!!
Love it This podcast has made me look at the world differently on many occasions. I love listening to Glennon, Amanda and Abby’s take on topics from fun to gender roles to self care. I would highly recommend to anyone, is thought provoking yet has also made me snort coffee out my nose on a few occasions!
Thank you for the amazing podcasts I LOVE this podcast!! ❤️ I learn something new about myself and the “world” around me in each & every episode. So many “Ah!” moments that have helped me let go of what does not belong to me, rejoice in appreciation of  what I have let go of, the lessons I’ve learned and, how far I’ve come. Keep telling the truth and helping us to strive for it. 😊
Conversation Although I feel like I am a talk time stealer I am anxious and awkward during conversations. I feel like I don’t know how to ask the “good” questions that get healthy responses. So instead I talk about myself and monopolize the conversations.   I really loved this podcast as I felt like you were speaking to me directly.   Thank you!
Breathtakingly Insightful Glennon and Amanda are the type of women that when they speak, you want to listen to everything they have to say. Their insight on so many impactful, important topics have been so informative and I feel like I’ve learned so much by listening to their podcast every week. The episodes with Abby in them feel so special as well. Thank you so much for putting this out in the world for us. Please keep doing what you’re doing. You make the world better.
Finally talking about hard stuff I like the jokes and laughter, the rapport between the three hosts and especially that they talk about hard stuff including gender, sexuality etc etc
Beyond grateful I am so thankful for these podcasts. They cover SO many things I live and feel with honesty and compassion.
Magical A breath of relief and solidarity in my life. I’m like ‘YESS!’ every minute while I listen. So excellent. I hope this reaches lots and lots of people. Thank you for talking about things that are hard for many reasons, and then talking about the reasons. This is my kind of podcast.
My new therapist This podcast has quickly become my weekly reset. After listening to a new episode, I feel like I’m ready for the week again. I always learn something and have a moment where my feelings are put into actual words.
Breathtaking I recently moved across the country. My best friend is back home. We constantly listen before one another and creates great conversations/ meaningful connections. Love your podcasts!!!! And 2 days a week! Wow!!!!!
Just love love You all are my happy place.
So empowering These women give my words for my feelings ! They are wise and wonderful. I feel healing after every episode!
A Must for ALL!! Genuine! Love y’all.
Billboard worthy Hear conversations about the things that matter from real people who care. It is like hanging out with your bestie and being part of a community
Amazing content The topics no one is really talking about in a way that NEEDS to be talked about! Love it. I keep sharing and discussing with those around me. What a fantastic podcast!
SO refreshing!! Hot topics spoken honestly and openly ! Can’t get enough of this podcast ♥️♥️ Thank You
Glennon is incredible! You speak directly to my soul! So greatful for this podcast and being able to listen to you and your thoughts twice a week.  You make being human easier because I know I am not alone. We can do hard things, you’re right! So much love for you, Amanda and Abby - thank you 💛
Love this podcast! After reading “Untamed”, when I saw Glennon was set to start a podcast I had to give it a listen. Even if it doesn’t really apply to me, I have listened to every episode and not been disappointed. Even through what seems like a casual conversation between two educated, powerful women, I am learning. These women inspire me to feel empowered in myself.
Love them all! Thank you!  Shannon from Canada
My Church Hi there! I’ve been listening weekly since the first episode! I now refer to my time listening to you ladies: my church!   I feel like a midnight person: heavy, rainy, complicated, so sensitive, wherever I am! The conversations and topics in your podcast make me feel less alone! I truly love learning and reflecting and healing with every episode.   This ‘easy things’ episode was ‘a great idea’ though! Haha!! Gave me some laugh out loud moments! Needed that!  Just keep being you, doing what you do! You always seem to find the right topic with honesty and vulnerability!  Thank you dearly Amanda, Abby and Glennon!  Please Don’t ever stop!
we can do easy things… Please, please….do not go this route…it’s like eating watermelon and spitting out seeds, there is nothing let for me at the end of the broadcast.  I love your, “ we can do hard things” I feel like I have been waiting my entire life to face the dragons, do he hard things, because that in itself makes life easier.  I beg of you, leave, “we can do easy things” for those that want to do easy things, I don’t think you three really fit that bill….Love and Admire you Sue Gibbs, Canada
So good! Listened to every single episode last week. Highly recommend!
Feelings just listened to your podcast on setting boundaries and I relate so much to your story about going to breakfast at a hotel and noticing EVERYTHING going on around you and only getting a role. One thing I think is hard with a highly sensitive person is the pretending.. everyone is excited to go to the family reunion so you need to pretend your excited too to feel like your feeling the normal feelings you should have.. I struggled with this since I was a kid. I remember going to sleepovers and feeling like I needed to pretend I was happy and excited like the other girls but a million thoughts and worries would be going thought my mind. You put the things into words and I say Yes me tooooo!!! I am not so good at that.
You say what I am thinking I am listening to your podcast - I have read your book! Loved it. You are speaking for every woman out there. I tell all my friends to listen because you are saying everything I am feeling or have felt! It’s almost like, “it’s not just me!”. I loved the episode on being Overwhelmed. My husband would say to me every Saturday morning, “Give me the list?” I remember thinking, “No, you give me the list!” In other words, you go plan everything and I’ll do the easy part. One more thing (I know I’m going on too long). I use the bbq example. You plan the meal, invite the guests, make all the food, marinate the meat, your husband bbqs and everyone thanks him for the delicious dinner!!!! Love the podcast! Lou
Love you guys Pretty new to your podcast and I just love it. ❤️
Love I just finished Untamed, and I can’t get enough of you! This podcast is so amazing. I love hearing Sister and Abby on here as well, you guys are magical together. Thank you for everything you have introduced into my life and finally after 36 years on this Earth teaching me that I am not alone in the depths and heights of my intense feelings and more importantly teaching me that it is not something I should be trying to tame. It is my goddamn superpower. I ❤️you all🐆🐆🐆
Not enough This podcast is everything. Glennon and Amanda (and often Abby) are a reflection of all of us. Their words and experiences are relatable, funny, and thought provoking, and the issues they cover impact everyone. I look forward to each episode and would listen every day if I could. Thank you!
Podcast listening club My sister and I are enjoying this podcast so much. We listen to each episode, and call each other to chat about what we learned after each one. We’ve started referring to our “hard thing” and our “next best thing” in conversations we have, and it has brought us together even more (though we live on opposite sides of the country and have not seen each other in over two years)! We were especially moved by the boundaries episode, but every single one is amazing. Thank you Glennon, Amanda and Abby for having these hard conversations and sharing them with us. You’ve started the conversation about some hard topics, but what you may not know is that many of us listening have continued on those conversations over the past few months. It’s helped us work through many hard things!  PS. If you listen to just ONE episode of We Can Do Hard Things, make it this one: Boundaries: Are too few (or too many) why are we stuck?. But listen to them all!
Beautiful show Love love the podcasts!  I’m a younger mom who has overcome 11 years of addiction and freedom. From death bed to living free. So happy to listen to you guys.
Freaking awesome!! This podcast is just so real and vulnerable and relatable! I recognize myself in so much of what you say, even in the discomfort I can tell you sometimes feel about addressing some topics. Yet you do the hard thing and that leads me to reflect on my own hard things. I think this show makes me a better, happier, more true-to-herself person. Thank you!
This podcast has everything. I laugh. I cry. I relate on all the levels. I haven’t missed an episode. The ones with Craig and Abby are *chef’s kiss* so freaking good. Thank you for sharing your flavour and your magic. We are here for it! Xx
Fighting I have listened to that episode time and time again there are so many truth bombs that can through for me that I in fact learned a bit more about myself. I am NOT a sharer either and it has dawned on me why …..  I thank you for this   I am a fan
Necessary! Everyone needs to listen to We Can Do Hard Things. It’s heart warming, thoughtful, and just so perfect.
Soul food Glennon and sister are a magical mixture of pure goodness, authenticity, fierceness, and beautiful quirkiness.  Their hearts and brains are so smart in all the ways, and every single time I listen,  I walk away feeling full, seen and heard on such a deep soul level. I just adore them and can’t thank them enough for telling me two times a week that I can do hard things, and that I am not alone. And I cry every time I hear the theme song ♥️
Love This podcast is like meditation, therapy, and that cozy feeling of hanging out with your best friend all in one.  It will make you laugh, cry and spark interesting/important conversations.  ‘We can do hard things’ is so relevant and so needed.. I just love everything and everyone in this community so much. Thank you!
So real & genuine! Love this podcast. Love the way that Amanda and Glennon chat so honestly about difficult things they’ve encountered in their live and what they might still be working on. A great listen for anyone!
Every episode touches the soul Every single time I listen I find myself saying out loud: “YES! I feel this too!” Glennon and sister have a gift of articulating the inner experiences we all have, to make the listener feel not so alone. I look forward to my Tuesday morning commute every week so I can listen, relate, and feel connected. Thank you for the gift that is this podcast.
Empowering Every episode invites me to return to myself. It’s hard but I feel like I am on the right track. Thank you for your sharing and your courage.
Thank You! This podcast is so helpful. You model love without control, a model I want to use. What a team, all four of you. I can understand why People want to know why Craig is single!
Love you more every episode The wisdom both simple and profound that comes out of EVERY FREAKING EPISODE just blows my mind. I’ve been reading Glennon for a long time, and consider myself a pretty experienced and self-aware person, and yet I learn new things EVERY time. I nod and even speak aloud sometimes and just let the epiphanies wash over me. Honestly, I’m not even an podcast person… this one is just so worth it.
Tuesday is my favourite day This is such a beautiful podcast. Every episode that comes out is my favourite. Thank you, Glennon, Sister, Abby and Craig for showing up as lovely, vulnerable, perfectly imperfect humans. I love listening every week, tucked up in my little Arctic town- and Tish’s song makes me teary every time (so happy I can download and share her music). So much gratitude for you all.
Love this podcast! Beautiful, inspiring, truthful conversations about important yet often neglected subjects and life experiences. Can’t get enough!
It’s like she’s in my head. I love this pod cast!  So many times she will say something and I’m astounded because I thought that I was the only one who felt that way or experienced that thing.  I actually told my husband that needs to listen to it so he can understand me better.
So good I listen to them twice Okay, I barely have time to listen to podcasts once, but I love listening to Glennon and her sister talk about real stuff SO MUCH that I have to re-listen. Thought-provoking, warm, empowering… it’s just what I need.
Love it! I look forward to listening every week! G, sister, Abby…everyone is so open and honest and vulnerable. It’s like listening to your close friends have deep conversations.
This podcast is saving my life I love every episode. I have to pause it so often to just process what I heard. Glennon Doyle is my ah ha moment/person. It gives me ALL the feels!!!
Thank you Glennon and Sister! Thank you for providing these thought provoking discussions on such a wide range of hard but necessary topics. I continue to take away lessons to use in parenting, relationships and my professional life. Keep these wonderful podcasts coming! P.S. Tish’s song is fantastic - I sing along at the end of every podcast.
Best podcast ever This is the best podcast I’ve ever listened to. I am excited for every Tuesday’s new episode. These sisters are incredible!
Definitely a podcast worth listening to with those close to you I absolutely LOVE this podcast. I actually listen to it with my partner, parent, basically anyone who will share the experience with me and discuss during and afterwards.
You feel like the voice I never knew I needed G!!! You are a voice for those of us that are lost sometimes! Your ability to share honestly with such inspiring vulnerability is what makes the unbearable just a little beautiful. Thanks for every things you do! Truly. ❤️❤️❤️
This podcasts is my safe place Thank you so much for this podcast. Glennon - I don’t know you but I feel like I am you in so many ways. Your bravery in your honesty has been so wonderful for me. I feel like I’ve lived my life being told I’m crazy or I’m too much and wondered why I have been crippled with anxiety and self doubt. To love myself I need to trust myself and you taught me that. Thank you! I love sister and Abby so much - I feel like I know you all. Please keep being you - you are definitely a cheetah.
Perfection I love Glennon, and so its no surprise that these podcasts are full of lightbulb moments, and feeling a little less alone in my head. She and Sister are perfection together.
Beautiful, open and honest I absolutely love these vulnerable conversations. There is so much empathy, wisdom and realness. Glennon and her sister make you feel so seen. And I absolutely love when you bring Abby on. All beautiful and tender souls.
Life changing I am a better and stronger person because of the teachings, perspectives, lessons, and honest talks. Thank you Glennon and Sister.
Life changing I feel held and free listening to this podcast. Thank you.
So far This podcast is absolutely the very best. The Queer episode was so so good. Thank you Abby and Glennon and Sister. I cried so much. I learned so much. Thank you. I loved it was longer too. I feel like the others prior to were not long enough. I loved this. Sent it to so many family and friends. This was necessary to hear. I love God too. I am no longer a member of a church that rejects.
So impactful and practical! Love love love listening.  I listen while I nurse my baby and it is so good!! Loved the infidelity episode.  Especially how people asking what happened is never about you but about them!! Thank you for articulating that as it has been driving me crazy for a decade. 🥰
Love this podcast! Tuesday’s are my favourite day of the week thanks to you two wonderful ladies - thank you for all you share with us xoxo
Incredible One of the best podcasts I have ever listened to - Glennon and sister are so wise. I refer to this podcast as my “weekly therapy session.” It’s helped my partner and I connect, as well as better understand ourselves. Incredibly grateful to have this podcast in my life. Huge fan!
Just listen… To them all you won’t regret it. Thanks for such a great podcast.
Everyone should listen to it Episode 8 is the best so far ❤️
Grateful for your Truth I just finished reading Untamed and listening to your podcast on Anxiety...and now I'm off to start my pod squad. Thank you so much for your strength, honesty and belief that we can do hard things! Looking forward to more! Much Appreciation!
Cannot recommend enough Glennon and sister, thank you so much for bringing us these discussions every single week. Every time I stray from myself, I swear you two bring me back. With every episode I’m reminded to come back to myself when the world gets a little too crazy and hard. Also, I literally get goosebumps AND watery eyes EVERY TIME Tish’s song comes on 😭😭 it’s too good.
Changing the way I think Listening to G, Sister and Abby (when she joins) feels like coming home. The depth, transparency and vulnerability of conversation, blended with acute humour, and helluva profound insight is changing the way I think. It feels as though I’m sitting down with a cup of tea, and experiencing a soul tonic with close friends. Thank you so much for doing this podcast.
Fun! Thank you for reminding us to have fun again! This podcast is one of the highlights of my week. You and sister are the most amazing duo!
Raw Ms. G is transparent. The paradox then is how thru her, I see.
I just cried… for 30 minutes straight during the Overwhelm episode. This is the first one I’ve listened to and it just spoke to every part of my spirit today. Thank you for sharing your words in a moment when I couldn’t. It was so validating.
Boundaries episode The boundaries episode was like attending a therapy session or an intervention designed for me. The things that were talked about felt so shocking, relevant and helpful that I wanted to pause it every few minutes to be like omg and absorb it in. I shared it with all my close friends. The part about defending yourself from others and not because of what they will do but because of what you will do in the name of your love for them… and the part of undoing boundaries to make others okay with them… Very helpful. Thank you G and Sister.
Look forward to your podcast each week! I am really enjoying your podcasts each week. Love the topics. Great heartfelt conversations- thanks for being honest and real. 💜🙏✨✨✨
Quickly becoming one of my favourite podcasts It feels like these days everyone and their sister is making a podcast (pun intended). I love Glennon Doyle but held low expectations for yet another podcast. Oh, forgive me for my unbelief! This podcast is incredible. A great mix of laughter and lightheartedness, plus real topics and deep thinking and reflection. I’m so grateful for G and Sister. And the We Can Do Hard things song?! So incredible. I wish it was available for download on iTunes!
Hallelujah! I’m so extremely delighted that this day has come, that Glennon and Sister have a podcast! I love love love this. These topics speak so deeply to me. Thank you Lord for giving us this🥰🙏❤️
More! More please!   Ps. I’m impressed by your daughter’s beautiful heartfelt composition - I never listen to the music on podcasts because they all feel very “bought” but this song I enjoy each time and glean a new tidbit of wisdom each time. 💚
Every week This hits home every week. Thank you for speaking so much truth.
Absolutely love! Look forward to the episode each week ❤️
So thought provoking, vulnerable and real! These podcasts have contributed to such great conversations with my friends and husband; really appreciate the transparency and vulnerability!  Highly recommend!!!!
Best podcast ever Every episode is relatable and enjoyable to listen to and they’re touching on so many important things!!  The most recent episode about being overwhelmed was like someone read my mind. Thanks Glennon and Amanda!!
Wonderful! I can’t even thank you two enough. It feels like you’ve put words to so many frustrations that I haven’t been able to explain. Both the Overwhelm and Fun episodes spoke to my heart and where I’m at right now. Thank you very much
I finally feel heard, seen, and understood Such an incredible podcast! The perspectives of Glennon and Amanda are so accurate, true, and raw. It’s really inspiring how they’re so authentic and real and untamed. The whole world needs to listen to these conversations. Thank you Glennon and Amanda for bringing these hard conversations to the table!
Such a joy to listen to every week :) Keep up the excellent work ladies. Xoxo.
Overwhelm I am listening to the audiobook Fair Play by Eve Rodsky and decided to hit pause because my sister sent me this episode and asked me to listen so we could chat. Ha!  The universe is not being subtle. Her book is everything you talked about and both have me thinking about fairness, division of labour, invisible labour, assumed responsibility, the list goes on.  As always, thanks for sharing and I can’t wait for next week’s episode!
Have a pen and paper nearby I listen while I run, and keep having to listen again to write down all the things that stop me in my tracks as I’m running so I can say YES, or What?!   Also, Tish’s song at the end gives me goosebumps every time.
Thank you This podcast has quite literally saved my life. It offered me different perspectives and tools that have helped pull myself out of the dark. Thank you thank you thank you. Real. Authentic. Brave.
Phenomenal I subscribe to a few podcasts but this is the only one that I listen to the day it gets released. I love it so much and always have at least one *ah-ha!* moment per show. Highly recommend.
Honest and authentic. Love love love the podcast. Such a breath of fresh air. The honesty and authenticity is so Important. Thank you. Would love an episode on motherhood.
Awesome Listen I really enjoy listening to this podcast weekly. Glennon and sister show their vulnerability talking about hard things. I have had a take away from each episode.
Love it! I read Untamed and loved it. Gave the podcast a try and 🤯. I’ve listened to every one and that’s new for me. You’ve made me laugh and cry and I look forward to it each week.
So great As amazing as I hoped. Thank you G!
Thank you As an introvert and a person who loves to dive into deeper conversations, I feel like I’ve been invited into a kitchen (I say kitchen because that is where all of the conversations happen) without previous judgment. It feels like I’m part of a BFF group that I’ve been longing to have in my life. Thank you so much for being here.
Fun I’m a woman and have many women friends and we definitely know how to have fun....it fills up our cups, so it’s not pointless. So it’s really not a woman thing.
Podsquad Playlist Love what you and sister are doing. Thinking Mony Mony by Billy Idol might make a nice addition to your playlist. It makes me forget to be calm, cool and collected whenever I hear it.
It’s All Fun and Games Til Someone Loses an Eye I’ve been a fan since Momastery, loved your Instagram postings when you were promoting and talking about Untamed. I bought Untamed and shared it with my daughter. Now I listen to your podcasts which I also love.   Today when you were talking with Abby and sister about ‘fun’ it was so thought provoking! And fun. I’m a mom of 2 and now a grandma of 3 and I had a lovely fun grandma as an example of how to ‘grandma’. I honestly have never had more fun than I do now in my 50’s as a grandma with my grandkids. Their parents are horrified ... ha ha ha.  And I dance and sing like nobody’s watching because I don’t give a f:&k if they are 😆.  One final random thing ...ages ago on my grade 5 report card my teacher wrote in the comments section about how ‘strong’ I was in gym class. I have never forgotten her comment and it’s informed how I see myself. I am strong! Goddess bless the teachers!  G, keep on dancing, singing loudly, sharing and having ‘fun’!
LOVE THIS PODCAST!! Every episode I just keep thinking no way the next one can beat this one but every week I’m blown away!!
Validating Glennon says the things I feel. It makes me feel not alone. And I have a sister too. We are less lovey dovey but the relationship is still the same. We would hide bodies for each other.
Borders Are you walking around in my brain??
Fun is not worrying about how you appear.. This episode is a necessity for life. Thanks G, Abby and sister. doing hard things with you is fun:)
Joy Glennon and Abby bring me joy with their thoughts. Really enjoying getting to know Sister too!
Emotional Monitoring As a HSP who grew up without boundaries this episode really blew my mind. Thank you for sharing about emotional monitoring as I do this as well. It’s something I’m working on. ❤️
So much love! I love this podcast! Every episode is just so much....YES!!!!  Thank you Glennon & Amanda for these beautiful conversations & letting us be a part of it. We can do hard things, we are doing hard things. And we are surviving, thriving!! Thanks for the reminder.  Amd the cherry on this beautiful podcast-cupcake is tish’s song to finish...gahhhh still can’t get through it w/o crying!! Incredible! Never change!  “And to be loved we need to be known” so much yes!  ❤️❤️❤️ v
So true and helpful The episode on infidelity hit so many familiar feelings for me, and framed them in ways that felt new and so true. So much in there for people going through separation or grief at losing a relationship, not just due to infidelity. These conversations are juicy, smart, kind and much needed. Thank you!
Freaking LOVE Glennon and Sister Now more than ever before.
Boundaries! Love this episode. A complex topic with insight and real life examples. Glennon, I love you daughter’s song but I can’t find it on Spotify! Help! 💖💕🙏🏼
THANK YOU!!!!!! I read Untamed and it deeply changed my life and helped me learn to love myself after my divorce. Now this amazing podcast is a lovely gentle reminder to all the cheetahs to keep loving themselves and that there’s so many wonderful humans out there doing all the hard things. And also, I love the incredible deep bond between Glennon and Sister and this podcast is funny and inspiring and ‘simply the best, better than all the rest’ (to quote another cheetah)
Totally in love Thank you thank you  I am a fan ... before. now, and forever more  Xxoo
I’m home.... I relate so desperately to so much of this. Walking my neighborhood listening to “I can do hard things” I’m brought to tears because it gives me so much strength and a sense of belonging. Thank you G and Sister 💕
I needed this This podcast is everything I need and more. Glennon is the best friend to all of us cheetahs and her advice and wisdom is so deep. Every topic hits home which gives me comfort that I am not alone with these experienced and feelings. Glennon and Sister- THANK YOU!! ❤️
Just thanks. I want my life and independence back and you’re helping, so thanks. Keep it coming, the world needs your voice. (You too, Sis)  I’ve been immobilized for a couple of years by anxiety and fear. It is spilling over and now my daughter (9) is also showing signs of, well, emotionally not managing. The only thing to change her lens is seeing an animal, or when I say “We can do hard things.”  I also say it to myself.  Things are picking up since I did a Hard Thing. Slow, but I’ll take any progress. What’s the rush?  I read Untamed last summer, and it was a lens-shifter, which to me is more valuable than GOLD. I got attached to hearing one wisdom after another. I call them “Gems”. Thank you for keeping it coming.  Also, where on earth can I find the guitar chords for “We Can Do Hard Things”?  (I just listened to it six times in a row)
dear sisters thank you!!! Dear brave women! thank you again! The episode about conversation really struck a cord with me - as I am notorious interupter😬- and I was ashame of it, I wanted to change it but I didnt know how to deal with it! THANK YOU! Could you please do an episode on anger/all not “appreciated” emotions? greetings from Anna, your (self-proclaimed🙃) biggest fan from the Czech Republic❤️
Thank You Thank you doesn’t feel like enough to say for the work you are doing on this show. I have wept at every episode and have never felt more seen and heard and safe as I have when listening to your conversations. Thank you Glennon and thank you Sister for bringing your hard things and giving us permission to bring ours.
Helt igennem herlige mennesker🥰 Jeg er i gang med at høre det hele fra en ende af, og jeg får så meget ud af den her podcast! De herligste damer, med en fantastisk  smag i de folk de inviterer ind. Tak fordi i oplyser mig ❤️
Big love from Denmark Listen to your pod every week. Such a treat. Love it big time. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️
True love Love, love, love this podcast. It shines the light on so many extremely important and human topics, oftentimes topics that many of us may be afraid to talk about, or that we don’t have the language for yet. And Glennon, Abby and Amanda always show up in the most loving, generous and human way. Thank you from my heart to yours!
Beautiful, inspiring, honest and joyful Each episode makes me feel like I just spend time with wonderful friends having conversations about things that matter in life. There is warmth, honesty, joy of life and a curiosity about what it means to live this wonderful and sometimes tumultuous life. The episodes gives food for thought and there is both insightful conversations and heartwarming laughter ❤️ A warm recommendation to tune in and listen to this amazing podcast 😊
Not a single episode I didn’t love The most beautiful and original podcast out there. Absolutely love it, and I feel mindblown in small and large ways by the content and their perspectives. Feels like a big warm heartfelt hug and inspirational at the same time.  Highly recommend :)
Amazingly witty, engaging and supportive! I’m listening to all of the episodes second time around now and they always know what I need to hear in that moment. I can’t imagine a world without this podcast 💜
Can only recommed listing 🙏🏼❤️ This podcast have helped me so much. Thank you for taking the time too make it and sharing so much of yourself. I now believe  that we actually can do hard things! ❤️ And thanks too Tish for that wonderful song, it is the themesong of my life.
Thank you Thank you for your honesty, your bravery, your vulnerability. Thank you for lighting up the darkness. Your podcast is my new religion.
Safe and inspiring place! I always feel safe, seen and inspired in your company! That’s actually not true: sometimes I feel challenged, stretched in the best way possible. Walking away having myself as a friend again. Thank you. And a special thanks for recently the gift of bringing Liz Gilbert’s wise, human voice to my ears again. You all three do an amazing job.
This podcast is amazing and so important! Thank you to all 3 of you!
This podcast is everything and more Glennon, Abby and Amanda - you’re truth, love and light. This podcast addresses so many tabu topics that are part of our daily lives and I must say that I can’t imagine life without it anymore. We for sure can do hard things - especially when we have such beautiful souls that remind us of our true humanity on a weekly basis. Thank you- deeply🙏🏾   Lots of love from Denmark 💜
Please keep podcasting! I love your podcast more than words can say. If you ever stop by Denmark, you can live in my house, eat my food and sit in my garden all day long. As long as you keep sending this wonderful podcast out into the world✨.
Love it! Fantastic podcast with fabolous and smart people🙌
Thank you Please don’t ever change the way  you are doing this podcast because it is changing my life! You three are amazing and Tish’s song made me cry on my walk with my dog❤️
The song - soooo beautiful Thank you for all your insight and for sharing it with me. I just have to acknowledge the talent and the beautiful voice og your daughter. From one singer to another 🙏🏼🎵❤️
Thank you💗 Thank you for your honesty and love💗
Love it!!! I love how you make me feel understood and normal 😅🥰
Loved it💜 Thank you so much, saved my day🥰
Multiple eps are multi-listens Not all topics are relevant to me, but the ones that are—WHOA. Will listen multiple times and often read/watch materials discussed or worked on by their guests. Thank you Glennon, Abby, and Amanda!
Real self-care So in line with what I’m currently reflecting on. Thank you!
I love you Please, please, please interview Michaela Coel!
This podcast is necessary! One of the most powerful podcasts I’ve known. I love listening to those amazing women, it makes me feel stronger. Go on cheetahs, we can do hard things 💪🏻❤️
Alex Hedison episodes Thank-you very much for these episodes. Alex gave me the language for the experience I have been going through since drastically reducing my alcohol intake a couple of years ago. In addition, when she talked about how she’d handled relationship issues previously awakened me to my partner’s behaviour- I hadn’t connected the different aspects before. So illuminating 💕🙏
Finding your healing partner Thank you so much for this podcast. Thank you for putting words on all of the hard things that our lives bring. We are not alone ❤️
Personal growth with laughter I can’t say how much this podcast has helped me heal, understand and grow since episode 1. I am so beyond thankful to Amanda, Glennon and Abby for putting this gem into our lives. It’s such a service to all of us out there. Thank you!
Home It feels like sitting around chatting heart to heart with your best friends. Thank you.
I feel seeeeeen!!  🥹 Thank you Amanda, Abbey and Glennon for putting so much hard work into this phenomenal podcast!  The guests brought with the on and the weekly topics (& wake up calls) are so applicable to daily life on the many topics that make us human 🫶🏼
Cannot live without this podcast!! I never miss an episode;this is more than a podcast,this is like having a warm,loving & safe support around me as I try to navigate life. Have learnt so much,thank goodness for Glennon,Abby & Sister xx
Relatable in many different ways I can't remember exacty when I discovered this podcast (it's relatively recent) but I've been loving it. Glennon, Sister Amanda and Abby make me feel "normal" (whatever that means but it's for lack of a better term...). I can relate to all 3 of them in some way. Thank you for these interesting and heart warming conversations :-)
My favorite time of the week This podcast is an absolute gem, it has helped me feel so much stuff, and think about so many things and made my day to day life so much better!
This podcast is public service Every single conversation held in this podcast has brought me more clarity, strength and peace that I could have imagined. Thank you !
A slice of joy in my week I have only recently discovered WCDHT podcast and oh my goodness how lucky I am to have a back catalogue of episodes to go through!  Real conversations and difficult topics are addressed in a relatable and relaxed manner, sprinkled with love and giggles.  You’ll just want to be round the table with Glennon, Abby and Sister sipping a coffee, getting deep and sharing their love. Go listen!
Raw and real I arrived late to the party in time for the Liz Gilbert episodes but what an experience! The honesty and vulnerability is touching and beautiful. Thank you 🙏🏻
Thank you from France! I look forward to listening to your podcast each tues and thurs morning as I walk through the forest with my dog Hector. I have cried, laughed, sang during those walks, feeling so many feelings so deeply. Thank you for being so authentic, for sharing your stories. Maybe one day our roads will cross:) Hugs! Fleur (french-american california girl living in france!)
You have to listen to this podcast! More than like it, just love it! Sending you ladies untamed love, support and positive vibes from France! Keep doing what you do. I love the balance of the three of you - the interaction, the different opinions and approaches and pretty much everything sister says resonates with me personally! 😆😁
Thanks Yes girls! Happy to have found this and grateful for your insights and candor. Hells me to feel better about me xx
Critical Listening I more than “liked it”, I loved it, and I continue to love this podcast. I feel so grateful that Glennon, Amanda (and occasionally Abby) decided to make it. 💛💛💛
Powerful Ms. Glennon and Amanda talk about hard issues that some of us are too fearful, embarrassed or ignorant of, to even talk about. If we’re lucky we have one person that we can confide in but I suspect that many of us suffer in silence. This podcast will help you to figure out that you (we) are normal and that there’s a reason as to why we might feel the way that we do. You’ll also find yourself laughing out loud at the messiness of life, gushing at new found perspectives and feeling like you just might have finally found a tribe, a sisterhood if you will. Thank you Sisters, you have changed my brain (aka “my life “) and I am SURE that my experience is just one drop in the ocean compared to the countless lives that you have touched. Sending you a huge thank you and lots of love and positive energy, Danielle Browne.
Inspirational Sisters Thank you Glennon, Amanda, Sisters. I absolutely love your podcasts. They are refreshing, awesome, uplifting and inspiring. I am also very touched by your love and admiration for each other. Cheetahs are amazing creatures… keep on doing and being  and thank you again.
Sooo fun, and smart and vulnerable! Please Glennon, write a next book with Abby about fun! Such an important subject. I could see myself as a child running on a beach: pure joy, and then as an adolescent, much different (self awareness, shyness, motionless ness).   I’ve always wondered why I wanted to be a boy for so long! They seemed to know how to have fun. And I cried when you mentioned watching women playing soccer (or basketball or handball or rugby here in France).  Totally love this podcast and your voices, integrity, complicity. Pure joy! And joy is what children have that as adults we don’t even know we want to connect with... again. Thank you!
Hard and soft at the same time 🤍 Thank you Glennon and Amanda for sharing your truth with the world. This episode is going through hard things in such a way that it just feel more alive at the end of it.   Also, I love Tish’s song. I have been rewinding the podcast over and over on those last few minutes to listen to it. Is it accessible on YouTube? I couldn’t find it.  Tons of love from Paris XX
This podcast is exactly what we need right now This podcast is a simply a gift. Thank you Glennon and Amanda for your openness, thoughtfulness, and for putting into words things that we feel but don’t know how to say. Can’t wait to start a “we can do hard things” pod squad for this! ❤️ Merci from Paris, France
what a gift!!!! I'm soooo excited that I will get to listen to Glennon and her wonderful sister EVERY WEEK now!! What a gift. As a person who doesn't have anxiety, but with a partner who (probably) does, I learned so much and I'm most excited about the fact that we are going to be having new and different conversations about all of the fears and circular thoughts he struggles with that I didn't really understand how to help him with before. Thank you. I FREAKING LOVE YOU AND SISTER!!
Already Awesome I just listened to the introduction episode with big goosebumps and a massive smile on my face so yup : no doubt this podcast is going to be absolutely amazing, lovely, thought provoking, inspiring, music to my ears, my heart and my soul.  Thank you so so so so much Glennon for spreading more of your light and love all over us, we need it, we need you, we love you! My coffee will be ready, the subscription is on✅ , I can’t wait to be the 11th !!!! 😍😍😍😍You absolutely WONT be alone to your party!!!  💙🤍❤️ hell yes baby, We CAN do hard things!! 😍🙌
Essential The Post-election Episode has been the single most important piece of media on the matter for me. Thank you so much for showing up the way you did. 🫶 from Berlin, Germany
A Brave and Essential Conversation on Healing I recently listened to the two-part series where Glennon shares her journey of going off medication, and I found it incredibly brave and impactful. The openness with which Glennon, Abby, and Amanda discuss such personal and complex topics is both refreshing and necessary. It shows us all that healing isn't a linear or easy path and that it often brings up unexpected challenges. Their willingness to have these difficult conversations publicly is a true gift to listeners. This podcast is a rich and courageous exploration of real-life struggles, and I am grateful for the honest dialogue it inspires. Thanks Jay from Germany
Loves ya What an amazing podcast! I totally loved your life hacks (sent whilst doing a pile of towels…)
Glennon, Abby, Amanda Thank you so much from Germany, the podcast is one of the few I listen to regularly. Absolutely helpful, comforting, compassionate, touching and just heart warming.
Wonderful & really helpful Podcast… …with lovely & wise women and an impressive range of topics and guests. Thank you very much!
Amazing Thank you for the really great content, the inspiration you share and the lightness you spread walking hard topics. I am a huge fan of yours and am so privileged to be able to listen to such a podcast. Thank you!
Amanda I really love this podcast, but I have to say it felt really disturbing to hear what sounded like Glennon pushing Amanda on the episodes on Amanda's diagnosis. Glennon saying "say more about that, talk more about that" etc. felt so wrong. I know there are things that get said and set up behind the scenes but as a listener, it was uncomfortable and invasive. Wishing Amanda all the best for this process
A good comfort podcast I listen to this when I need to feel comfort because the hosts are so authentic and they interview incredible authors and thinkers. I don’t subscribe because many episodes are like going to too many recovery meetings for newcomers. The hosts are trying to figure so much out without reading more than the interviewees books or learning any history about the topic. Glennon has a big question about gender so how about a series of podcasts on Gender where she interviews thinkers who inspire ALOK and Ocean Vuong and many scholars in the field- many of which who had the exact same question and have already answered it. Covering one topic as if they just discovered it and moving on is a very white thing. The hosts have the ability to learn the surface level understanding of a topic and never go deeper, which is the key to healing and thriving. They get to be successful in a sort of victim mode  as they try to “figure it all out” on many topics instead of going deep on one at a time.
Truly incredible This podcast is insanely good. The ingenuity of these podcasters is beyond comparison. It blows my mind that it is even possible to create this much content of this insane quality. I can not begin to understand how you achieve this. I hope u read this and get some satisfaction out of my disbelief.
The Power of Childfree Women I have not felt seen in any podcast in a while and this one hit the nail on the head. I immediately shared it with my childfree community, one I started at the beginning of the year and saw women flock to join and finally find others who are like them. Thank you doesn’t even cut it! Looking forward to reading Ruby’s book now. You’re doing GREAT thing !!!
My favourite! My favourite podcast hands down. So much love, laughter, truth, beauty and hard thing to listen to and feel part of. Thanks! Also: If I get through my first marathon in April it’ll be in (big) part could your podcast was there for me on long runs, making sure that smile on my face remain!
Makes my days!!! I can‘t live without this Podcast! Well, I could, because I can do hard things…BUT I don’t want to! Love you all!
Thank you for your words and love! I love love love this podcast. Listening to you feels like coming home!
Thank you for saving us!!! Thank you Glennon, Abby and sister Amanda! Listening to your podcast is like participating in an intimate conversation between friends. I cannot begin to explain how you have changed me as a wife, sister, friend, partner and daughter. Thanks to your wisdom and vulnerability, I have become a gentler, more self-loving, and more supportive young woman. Every relationship in my life has changed and become more real and deeper. I thank you with all my heart!! (Sorry for my English, it's my second language)
SO MUCH LOVE 🌈 One of my absolute FAVOURITE podcasts on this planet. I read Untamed when it was coming out here in Germany and loved it. You guys are so dear to my heart, just such a sweet team to listen to. 🧡 I‘m SO grateful for you. 😘 Thanks so much!!!
Don’t need rhyme’s- not a Christian anymore :) Listening to you while walking through the forest, or swimming in the fresh near by river while watching my dog explore the world with her nose.  Moving my heart, connecting to my center, Feeling grateful, feeling better, less alone and not a fighter, trying to add peace and harmony learning to set boundaries.  Listening becoming present, stillness calmness - beauty arrives. Blending out all the noise, till all is left, is forest soundtrack in the head.
Life Changing! Thanks for making me feel good in my own skin again. It’s like having my best friends close to me. I feel less alone in this world.
These 3 are life changing and uplifting …. I absaloutly love to listen to your podcasts . I want to be your friend too ! The banter , humor, intelligence, the emotional/ social skills you show are so impressive that you literally seem to be able to talk to everyone in a respectful ,kind way that you get the best out of the conversation.  Such a skill . I am British and just listened the etiquette manners pod….what a massive subject !  You make me feel normal . Thanks to you 3 again .  Please don’t stop ….. Vanessa
Smart and beautiful With this podcast you’re never alone. I love the three hosts and their incredible guests that always feel carefully chosen and all interviews are well conducted and topics well researched. So much fun, truth and love.
Love love love this podcast I read Glannon's book and then started listening to the podcast. I am a listener from Germany and love every single episode and appreciate this podcast very much. So many topics are discussed deeply and these three women are just wonderful. I learn so much every time and am very grateful that this podcast exists. And by the way, my English vocabulary is increasing. I love you guys, keep up the good work.
You blow minds! Your work is so profound and touching and always leaves me with a little bit more. What a gift. Thank you so much!
This pod is everything I love the softness, wit, realness and kindness with which Glennon, Abby and Amanda address the topics and speak to all of us. Thank you! I cried the first episode in, smiled and thought ha! here are my people. Thank you for holding us and seeing us so deeply. Thank you for your light & care! Cannot wait for the next episodes! And Tish‘s song is amazing! Please tell her it touched me to the core. ❤️
Conversations I wish I had! I so much appreciate the courage and the dedication you follow in talking about topics everyone is interested in but not capable of talking about! I love every episode, share it with my children, husband and friends- so that we all together change the world!!🙏🏼💞
Grateful and Hopeful Thank you so much for your work! I am so grateful that i could listen to your precious thoughts and conversations! You make my world brighter and richer! You bring so much Hope and Wisdom into the world! You all keep going! Sending you much love from Germany!
Life-changing, healing, thought-provoking Like “therapy to go”. I get so many aha-moments, clues to new paths of healing and self-exploration - I just can’t recount how many times I was stopped in my tracks while listening to this podcast. It’s raw, it’s honest, it’s real. I just love it and cannot express how grateful I am for the work they do. Would give 10 stars if it would be possible.
You Guys Keep It SO Real!! I’m a podcast lover! But your podcast is among my top 3 faves! I’ve been listening from episode 1 and have been with you on the journey! I love how real you guys are and how authentically you speak about topics that are usually shrouded in secrecy. I especially love the episodes where it’s just you three!! Love you all 💜
How we stop doing our best How do we stop doing our best? Exactly what i needed to hear. Isn’t it weird, I’m from northern Germany, nearly Denmark, and it’s the same stuff that’s driving us crazy? That we think and feel the same? Thank you. It just heals me from wanting to be better than i am.Steffi
Thank you! Thank you! Such a beautiful, authentic and inspiring podcast!
An oasis for the big stuff! Even though it is quite ‚crowded‘ for a podcast, Abby, Amanda & Glennon managed to maintain a very quiet and calm space to talk about loud and explosive topics a.k.a about life. Thanks for sharing, enjoying it very much! 😊
Thank you I love your podcast as it’s so honest and a reminder that we should try every day to be kinder with us and others. That there’s no right or wrong, just trying and failing and trying and, some day, succeeding. Whereas every trial is a success and approach to getting closer to who we are and how to embrace our real, true self and fulfill our needs to be that person. I feel connected and whole listening to you guys. Your honesty, vulnerability and humanness inspire me to invest more of mine into my daily life. Makes a life more worthy despite the fear of showing up raw and pure. Thanks for everything you do, your own hard work on yourself to make the world a better place. You really do. ❤️
I enjoy your love and insights Listening to your conversations makes me realise, what I am missing… in my still new (4 years) relationship it is working, but meeting friends - still with distancing - I feel another distance, that makes me sad. Everyone seems to be tired, working too much… I will try to build new and deeper connections with my sisters (one friend actually is my sister, the others are sisters of choice and even one or two brothers). Thank you so much for inspiring me to live more wholesome… when Ashley Ford mentioned that she can always rely on herself , I felt big relieve and happiness… I did not know how much I trust myself! Liebste Grüße from Sylvia, Hamburg, Germany
Thoughtful little (and big) wisdom nuggets Thank you so much. I enjoy listening a lot. Always my journal close by to take notes. A hot tea in the other hand and a handkerchief in reach snuggled on the sofa - i am prepared for my favourite podcast and the next adventure.
Episode 42. is one of the smartest and most heart warming conversations I ever listend Big THANKS for sharing your thoughts and showing up.
Mindblowing! I love every word of every episode! The feelings, the love .. it feels like a big hug every time I hear your podcast! Thank you!
Gratitude This podcast is like the school of life we all need. Thank you Glennon, Amanda and Abby for so honestly, gracefully and intelligently opening so many doors in my heart and in my mind. Challenging me and nurturing my mind and heart with so much goodness!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE every moment spent listening to you, and in so doing, listening to ME!
Blissful, Wonderful, Emotional - Thank You I just listen to the first episode of this podcast. I am deeply touched and cried which is not happen so often.  Thank you for making me cry with the inspiring talk and the wonderful song!!!
Important topics discussed with honesty & vulnerability Thanks to the extended Doyle Wambach family clan for sharing and modelling how to talk about hard things with honesty, love & trust. This is the hardest first thing to do in the journey of doing the hard thing.
Every episode has been a treasure! Thank you for what you do!
Where is the most recent episode?? Love this podcast and look forward to every Tuesday when the new one comes out but what happened this week?? I see it is out on Spotify but not here? Will this be a regular thing? If so please let me know so I can stop using Apple podcasts.
❣️ Sisterhood! Love you G and sister!
It just gets better and better. I‘m a huge fan.
Deeply, fervently satisfying I feel the whole universe conspiring to help me navigate what I am living through. Glennon and Amanda came through with this podcast right when I needed them. Just as Carry On Warrior came when I needed to stay alive and get sober, Love Warrior came when I needed to stay and save my marriage, Untamed came when I needed the courage to leave it and now comes Hard Things when I need support and love and sisterhood to navigate divorce and starting from scratch on my own. Tish’s song makes me cry and heal a little more deeply with every listen. Thank you beauties, for giving of yourselves so generously 💛
Thanks Loved it. Thanks for your honesty and your being real and truly human. The world needs that.
Brilliant! I have looked forward all week to this, and it didn’t disappoint! You are such a bright, beautiful light in this world, Glennon, and it was wonderful to hear from your sister and Tish! Her song is phenomenal!! 💕
So so valuable Glennon is my number one for honesty, authenticity and the courage to be vulnerable when it comes to talking about the hard things we all face in our lives ❤️
Can’t wait! Glennon‘s voice is like a hug for the heart and I can‘t wait for the first episode!
Love love love I am a newbie to this podcast so playing catch up but just wanted to say that I bloody loved the Melissa Macarthy episode. She is such a wonderful human that makes me smile and laugh even when I don’t feel like it.
Life-giving wisdom This podcast just keeps getting and better. Thank you so much, Team WCDHT. Just one request: When an episode is a replay of something previously broadcast, please please make it clear in the episode title and description. I’ve queued up recent episodes with Ross Gay, Melody Beattie etc, excited that you’re having another conversation with them, only to find that it’s actually a re-broadcast of what I’ve heard already (which is perfectly fine, of course--it would just be great if that was made obvious when the episode appears in my feed). Putting ‘Encore’ or ‘Listen Again’ before the episode title would make it completely clear to the Pod Squad that this is not a new conversation, but a replay and a chance to revisit it. Hugest gratitude to you all!
Balm for my soul After the US election results I waited to hear from Glennon, Abby, and Amanda, knowing that their words would speak to my soul. They did. Thank you for calming my frayed nervous system, for making me laugh (Abby at the gym), and for helping me to make sense of my many, many feelings. You never fail to say the right thing. Love to you all.
A tonic Love this podcast.   Manages to be fun, insightful and supportive without being preachy or moany.
Making a better world for us all Outstanding. Joyfully weeping at the hope conflagration that comes toward me when I enter your curiosity world view.  Walter
Compassionate, witty, inspiring I’m really digging the vibe of these women and the nature of the tough, meaningful and insightful conversations that are having. I also love the sentiment behind the title of this show. This is a must listen that exemplifies the growth mindset within a self-help context. Keep up the great work!
Just my view… Lovely set up with three cosy, caring women… but the political progressive stuff was personally triggering for me as I have a strict religion and have been abused and bullied by people with very progressive views…. Just a thought… …to be more inclusive … A more neutral tone could reach a wider audience to include people like myself…. I was also unable to keep listening due to the casual swearing…
Two years on, it’s still saving me I reviewed two years ago but wanted to re-review to say how this podcast continues to change my world and my relationships for the better. I honestly don’t know where I’d be without it, it makes me feel less alone and like ‘my people’ are out there, even if they’re halfway across the world. I’ve never felt so understood, and with their incredible guests, they help me push through the tough stuff.
Wonderful ♥️ So grateful for We Can Do Hard Things. Wishing for a black woman to be present in the core pod squad too. We desperately need that perspective, IMO. I feel like I’m meeting with friends every time I start listening to a new episode.
My favourite podcast So much wisdom, warmth, honesty and laughter on the pod. I love the combination of these three women and they speak powerful truths that often bring tears to my eyes. Thank you Abby, Glennon and Amanda for your courage, open minds and curiosity for life.
Love this podcast! This podcast always brings me joy and gets me thinking. It’s real and funny and comes from the heart. Particularly loved the episodes with Andrea Gibson, Liz Gilbert, Cheryl Strayed and Dr Becky all of which have provided life changing wisdom for me. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda - keep sharing what’s in your hearts.
Soooooooo good! I’ve followed Glennon since the Momastery days, and she has just got better and better. So many important issues addressed with such vulnerability and humour; so many amazing guests; such a connection to their “Pod Squad” community — but above all the chemistry among the three of them is magic. Carry on, love warriors! We can do so many hard things when we do them together.
Intelligent, beautiful and life enhancing So grateful for these hosts and this podcast. So insightful, thoughtful, intelligent. Have recommended to everyone I know. Thank you!
Just YES I’ve been listening for about a year. Since then I have listened weekly, if not daily! You have seen me through many long nights of wake with young children. You make me laugh, cry, shout (not washing and re-using zip-bags is surely a red flag not a beige 🤣😂).  My wife calls you all my “friends” - “I’ll let you get back to listening to your friends”! I learn so much from the experts you speak to and from you all too, my friends! Thank you. Thank you so so much.
Passion and fury! This is about the episode released 17/07/2024 - how affirming to hear your passion and fury about the shambles the Democratic Party are making of this decision about who is on the ticket, about patriarchy and passing the baton. Your honesty, accountability and integrity are much appreciated, as well as the steps you take to explain it all to the people. We stand at the brink with bated breath. Who has the courage to step up?
Literally a life saver This podcast has been a true lifeline through the hardest period of my life. It has helped me to be more compassionate with myself and others. It’s given me the language I’ve needed to understand myself and be more intentional about how I show up in the world.  To use one of Glennon’s best expressions - I’m trying to live a more embodied life and I wouldn’t be here without the transformational conversations these beautiful people have 💛
Love love love Hi !! I just heard the two Alex Hedison episodes and thought about the fact that I haven’t written a review for you even if I have followed you for years. You are a breath of fresh air, and those two episodes were exactly what I needed to hear. Yes, please bring Alex back again!! THANK YOU thank you thank you for you being you.
Progressive and dynamic episode Resmaa was a revelation… making space for conversations that are difficult to hear is brave and progressive…Thank you
Life changing podcast Each episode improves me as a human. And is entertaining to boot 😊thank you for this and Alex episode wonderful. What a wise woman! And not afraid to admit to changing perspectives. Absolute same. Feel like I’m friends with presenters not thousands of miles away in scotland.xx
Thank you Thank you for showing up each week for us and sharing your lives with us. You don’t have to, I recognise that a choice and I’m so happy you do. This is the best podcast ever
Brilliant such wonderful important podcast addressing topics we all care about and profound useful insights
My favourite podcast with my favourite women The combination of Glennon, Abby & Amanda is genius. I love the guests too but truly could just listen to the three of you for hours too. In particular am always struck by the strong caring and quiet intelligence of dear Amanda. Never stop doing hard things you lot.
Ep 311 I wish my husband was even 1% as supportive & understanding as you, Abby! You guys have such a beautiful relationship. I hope you know how rare and beautiful it is. Jo - London x
Thinking of you Amanda - I haven’t met you but I consider you my friend. Thinking of you. Oh so much. You can do hard things. ❤️❤️
Restores my soul This podcast opens me to be the light I’m meant to be. It restores my soul. It makes me feel loved, understood and take up space. Abby, Glenn, sis THANK YOU 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
This podcast makes me feel happier AND smarter! I could not love this podcast more. I have found it incredibly enlightening and it has  also gotten me through tough times.   If you are looking to dip your toe in for the first time I would highly recommend episodes 46 ‘Happyish Holidays’ and 47 ‘Your Holiday Pep Talk’ for getting you through the holidays with family (these episodes were honestly lifesavers for me last Christmas and I listened to them twice whilst going on walks to have a break from the family!) and if you want to laugh your socks off listen to episode 116 ‘Our Most Embarrassing Stories’.   Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for being the friends in my ears.
Fantastic new episodes Big fan here from Scotland. As a lawyer, my favourite episodes recently have been on the Alabama IVF ruling, giving a voice to Palestinian voices, the Dr Ford episode and the ADHD episode. Thoroughly enjoying listening to more content on social justice issues. Keep up the good work! Big love 💜
The podcast equivalent of sunshine on a rainy day Love, love, love this show! Funny, warm, insightful, reflective, human… I found it by accident wanting to listen to one of their guests and now I am working through the back catalogue - it’s so so perfect for keeping me company through the ups and downs of parenting a small-child as an older, too-busy, full time perimenopausal insomniac! Thank you for bringing the kindness into my ears and helping to show me I need to give this kindness to myself. 🩷
This show is the highlight of every week Glennon, Abby and Amanda are incredible and make me feel so seen and understood. Listening to WCDHT feels like having three firiends and mentors with me at all times. I love these women and so look forward to new episodes every week!
Coming home ❤️ As a new listener, I spent the first few weeks of 2024 binge-listening and falling in love with Glennon, Abby and Sister. I really do ❤️❤️❤️being in your pod squad… it’s like coming home! Thank you for being a source of peace and inspiration, both in my life and for my own pod - you’re all women on a mission, for sure!! Here’s to deeper conversations and doing more hard things. 🙏
You make me feel normal! In a world where I feel like an abnormal alien navigating a strange place that everyone seems to have instructions except for me, Glennon makes me feel accepted and understood. We can do hard things is my safe space to feel like I’m not alone! Thank you ladies with all of my weird human being x
Love it The Dan Levy episode really explored the different tenants of grief, as someone who’s been through a lot this past year and is just starting a therapy journey it was helpful to hear from everyone on this episode on their grief experiences, thoughts and opinions. Thank you.
An absolute must I cannot be grateful enough for this podcast. Has been changing my life. Thank you to you all for sharing your experiences with the 'hard things'.
Grief Another brilliant episode 👌🏻 please please can you do an episode on grief with Clover Stroud brilliant British author who’s work is amazing and is currently living in Washington would be a fantastic guest xx
Love! These humans are so special and listening to We Can Do Hard Things is like hanging out with my dearest pals. Such love, wisdom and vulnerability. And unbelievable guests. Thank you so much Glennon, Abby and Amanda ✨💕✨
Incredible people These women are incredible to say the least! They are so genuine and kind. All their conversations lead with so much love and they introduce amazing reads and people. They always talk from the heart and tell us about their struggles. If you want real people these women are as real as it gets! They are people who are always curious and self discovering who they are! So relatable and also make me consider and think where I lie on such important topics. Thank-you pod squad :)
Often poetic in their observations I love how these presenters interact with each other and their guests. They often condense profound concepts into relatable stories from their own lives with perfect articulation. I always feel emotionally nourished after listening to one of these podcasts.. thank you x
Such high quality content These three angels and their amazing guests, honestly it’s so profound sometimes I have to take breaks because I need time to process what I’ve taken from the previous one. I love your dynamic, the way you treat guests and each other, your humour and warmth, your wisdom but also your humility. Thank you so much for this podcast and for sharing so much of yourselves, I love you x
Very insightful I found this very insightful. I thought the reinforcement or simplification of concepts really help. Very good pop cast
So very good Great guest speakers and fantastic hosts. Love it.
Late to the party, but quickly finding a home I wanted to say that I didn’t immediately love We Can Do Hard Things. However, I’ve come to understand that some shame I’ve been carrying was flaring when I heard the hosts being their whole selves. This isn’t a format where the hosts shrink themselves to make more space for the guests. Instead, all participants in the conversation go for it, deeply, courageously, honestly and supportively; and when they need more space because the conversation takes time they just get the guests back to go into more detail!  I’ve come to value being taken to sometimes uncomfortable spaces, to just sit there a bit, in compassion and curiosity. And, so far, 100% of the time that has helped me grow.  I think this project is beautiful, deeply needed, and audaciously guided by Abby, Glennon, and Amanda. I am so, so grateful. Thank you 🙏🏻
I didn’t know I needed this until I listened. Wow. Thank you for voicing all the things I didn’t know I was struggling with until I was recommended this by a colleague at work. So relatable, so honest and really helped me self reflect and make active changes to mind set.
Effing Awesome!!!! Wow. This is church for me.
Beyond grateful You have been such a blessing in my life during the last few years. Thank you for making me feel less alone while going through struggles, for allowing us to know you as intimate as you do. It is such a privilege!  Thank you for helping me discover more gems of humans that are your guests. ❤️
On mothering love ❤️ Wow 😢 what a beautiful note to Oprah from Glennon.
Hmm Love the podcast, double disappointed today. First by the new, hyper-glamorous cover photo, and then hearing Glennon claiming it shows her not having done anything with her hair and wearing no makeup other than a bit of tinted moisturiser.
Fab! Thank you lovely beings! So relateable and real ❤️
Wonderful, wise & kind I just love this pod ❤️ Glennon, Abby and Sister offer so much wisdom and food for thought. A safe space that encourages/facilitates completely non-judgemental self reflection, offering a calm and sensible point of view on the world. Keep these episodes coming ladies, absolutely love listening to you all 😘
I love you! Just the best, so healing, so warm, I love you, I thank you!  Powerful trio of women doing an amazing job, I applaud all three of you xxx
Amazing, affirming and challenging (in a good way) I love listening to this trio and their guests. It is a profoundly de-shaming space and whenever I listen to it I seem to laugh and cry. The guests are amazing and SO wise, and it’s really helpful to have the trio ask their insightful questions and give their take and angles on the topics.  I’m so, so grateful that this podcast exists. Each episode is a balm for the soul. Thank you ❤️
All the feels I am a loyal fan. I have listened to every episode in full. Thank God you do two a week!! I am constantly moved and inspired by you three and your amazing, articulate guests. Top notch. However, one episode stands above the rest for me — your double date with Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley. Wow! What a journey! I laughed, I cried, I shared Megan and Andrea’s love poems with my family at the dinner table and then listened to the episode again the next day on the school run. Thank you.
The light of Andrea Gibson is beautifully blinding Every episode is a joy, but I have to say that Andrea Gibson being on your pod was a gift to all of us - a wonderful first interview and a double date that made me feel EVERYTHING. A must listen for everyone. Thank you.
Friendship goals I love podcasts but this is the only podcast I religiously listen to week in and week out. Here I am in the English rain laughing and crying out loud on my own at work/on a walk/in the middle of a sleepless night. In another life I’m sat on a porch in the Californian sun chatting and avoiding parties with Glennon, Abby and Amanda! This podcast has got me through some dark days and helped me feel less alone. I love all three of you in a british socially awkward one-sided unrequited long-distance relationship kind of way! Please don’t ever leave the podsquadders to figure out life on our own!
honest, real , messy , love - homecoming connection and a chance to take off your bra or kick of your shoes and feel accepted, feel seen and to be challenged into raw realness. thank you ♥️
Really interesting conversations Lovely hosts being really open about all sorts of topics, an nice uplifting podcast
Beautiful, helpful and brave So much to love, so much to learn, gentle listening that will make positive change to your life and to the lives of your people.
Love love love My husband and I joke that this podcast is the third person in our relationship! I get so much from you. I listen every week and look forward to it so much. It was hard when you took your break! Haha. A stand out episode for me was Abby’s one (2 part). I wish I’d written straight after listening to it. Just ordered Wolf Pack to get more of Abby in my life. Listening from the UK! Xx
Raw and honest Such honest raw discussions about how to do life, in many different aspects.   Because they admit so many of their own failings along with wonderful wisdom  it feels like a great big hug, like we are all in this together.   Definitely recommend ❤️
Empathetic, engaging and emotionally connected I adore Glennon and I’ve read Untamed multiple times. This podcast is spectacular, the vulnerability in all 3 hosts blows me away. Thank you for doing what you do.
Beige flags I have been laughing out loud on the treadmill at the gym whilst listening to Ep 228!!!! This trio of honest, brilliantly wise, thoughtful and funny women are my people!! The vulnerability they have shown as they work through life, very genuinely, has shockingly challenged me and yet has been more effective with regards prompting action than anything else I have encountered. Their unfiltered honesty has encouraged me to be more true and probing with myself than I might otherwise be. They kept me sane when my husband and I were separated for 10 months during Covid. When I have felt self-centred or in my head, they have brought me out of myself.  And when I have not wanted to connect, I have reached for their voices.  What phenomenal role models. Recommend recommend recommend!!!
Beige!! Absolutely hilarious! Who knew anything beige could be so entertaining. Love the pod. Love you all……slips off to go & listen & guffaw again.
Makes me feel good about being human I love these 3 women and how they podcast together. The beauty of the compassion and understanding they show each other during their talks is breathtaking. They ask such important and hard questions and dive into the answers without fear and bullsh*t. But with so much love and acceptance.  Every time I listen, I come away challenged, I understand myself better, and those around me. I feel better about being human, and about living with humans (cause for me, that’s the hard part!!). Thank you, Glennon; thank you, Abby; thank you, Amanda. (Listening from the beginning)
Suzanne Stabile … Omg what a delight the two pods together were -the absolute joy of listening to your conversations with Suzanne. I learned so much, but I laughed lots too.  Thank you
Life affirming, game changing podcast for real people! Over about a month I have DEVOURED about 50 of Glennon, Abby and Sister’s brilliant podcasts. It came on to my radar at just the right time as I am going through a separation and ‘starting life over’. The Universe gave me the ‘We Can Do Hard Things’ podcast (and Glennon’s wonderful book ‘Untamed’ through a friend who went through similar.  This podcast is funny, real, informative (but not in a high brow unrelatable way) and just a delight every week. I can safely say I now cannot be without it.  Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for this diamond of a podcast! I’m always excited to hear what you will discuss each week.  From a loyal UK fan 🫶🩷
So honest and inspiring Thank you for your wonderful podcasts. I listen regularly and appreciate your honesty and openness. Re the “not guilt” feeling: could it be called “confluence”?
Life changing Every episode is relatable and brings a new insight into this weird, wild, challenging experience that is life. It is basically women telling their truths and being honest about their experiences but it works a healing magic on you. Cannot recommend enough. And the latest episode with Katherine May has probably changed my life!
I stopped everything and just listened I dip in to this podcast but always find myself listening to a few episodes each dip, usually while I’m working. I’ve just listened to Episode 215; The Bravest Conversation We’ve Had: Andrea Gibson. When this episode came on everything stopped and I just listened to each beautiful and difficult word with my heart.  This podcast shows generosity and kindness, it’s emotional, intelligent and kind.
Helping me to live more curiously The only podcast I listen to without missing an episode! Love listening tho Glennon, Abby, Amanda & their guests, find it mind & heart opening. I’ve discovered new books, tv and other things from listening. Thank you 😊
Wonderful podcast So vulnerable and moving. I just finished listening to Abby tell the story of her unrequited love. I could so relate over 15-20 I did this with a man who said he didn’t do relationships then when I stopped it he did. I love We can do hard things. So many episodes are relatable, touching, and I love love listening. You are inspiring and make me feel ok with me. Thank you
Laughed, cried, resonated This podcast is such a profound and inspiring listen every single time! The truth and authenticity just oozes out of every conversation. I laugh out loud, I cry out loud, and I am always sharing. Thank you Amanda, Abby & Glennon your words, stories, giggles, and interviewing approach is always amazing ✨💚
Andrea Gibson Andrea Gibson is a wonderful poet and this podcast was so many things! Interesting, funny, gut-wrenchingly sad, honest and joyful.  Thank you so much.
Moved to silence I listen to every episode and scroll back to write down the wisdom that connects with my heart. Today my heart was silenced by the works of Andrea Gibson. Andrea spoke to my soul, heart and mind. I am sat in total silence listening to my body react. Thank you for introducing me to someone who has touched me to my core.
Mu (uk) Thank you for Andrea, this conversation is so beautiful I never thought I could hear my own heart speak  In Love Mu ♥️
Speaks to your soul E215 The poem at the end spoke to my soul ❤️ So many of us spend our lives living in fear, shame and judgement, constantly comparing ourselves to others we forget to value the everyday small wonders of life. No matter how many times we hear the message live in the present, practice gratitude we are quick to jump back on the merry go round of life chasing the impossible when everything we need is right here. Our existence is finite and all those fears evaporate and become insignificant when death is at our door. Love is the only thing that is real and I agree with Andrea that everything that is written and I would go so far as to say everything that is created on this earth is gifted to us from those that have departed. God bless Andrea Gibson, Glennon, Abby and Amanda for being so real and vulnerable. I cannot thank you enough for how much this podcast has helped me personally Thank you 🙏
Recovering Control Freak thanks 💖 Episode 210!!! Wow!!! Thankyou! This arrived just as I needed it. And the fact that it happened at all BECAUSE there was no pre-approved questions is so beautiful and the best illustration of what can happen in life when we step out of the way and allow. I am going to take sisters advice about declaring what outcome I desire when entering discussions with my husband and children- I really feel like this is such a gentle introduction into letting go of the clenched fist of panicked control I’ve felt all my 51 years. I love you all and thanks again xxx Sally from Cornwall in UK XX
Never miss an episode This is a fabulous podcast. I have listened to every episode and even the episodes I think won’t apply to me have gems that are meaningful in my life and give me insight and knowledge. Really beneficial.
Feels like we’re best friends Listening to you three feels like I’m on the phone with my girlfriends. I loveeeee the honest conversations between you three and the impressive guests, have been an avid listener for years. This show has made me feel all the feels from joy (literally have cracked up and received so many confused faces on the tube), to gutted and frustrated. Love the diversity and the way you approach such profound topics with levity and humor. I especially loved the recent episode about overfunctioners. I have been trying to find the words to describe that exact feeling inside me and I hadn’t been able to. Thank you for finding the words for me. I feel so seen and like I now have a guide for how to navigate this with my partner. With love, thank you!
Better than any therapy For a working mother whose life is messy, beautiful and painful at times, this podcast is a lifeline and an easy way to feel heard and relate   Thank you!!!
Love this podcast I learn and laugh with each episode of this brilliant podcast. I’ve even made my husband listen to some episodes so he can understand me more. I’m forever changing up my podcast library but this one is here to stay. Thank you for all that you do, Glennon, Abby
BEST PODCAST EVER I absolutely love this podcast - I’ve listened to every episode.
Highlight of my listening! I love a good podcast and have a few favourites… but this is THE BEST!  Thank goodness there are two a week.  Podcast perfection.
Amazing insights I’ve loved this show since it started but the episode I just listened to prompted this review because it was just ‘wow’ - the most incredible insight. We are our bodies and they are the instrument through which we experience the world. Yes!!
I love this pod! I’m not a massive podcast listener, but I do adore this pod. I have an audible reaction to every episode, a “yes!” in recognition and agreement, howling with laughter or sobbing… Abby, Glennon and Sister get every emotion from me! Such important stuff, thank you team.
The only living girl in Devon (at the age of 45) We Can Do Hard Things is like the best kind of therapy and it’s a lot cheaper. I still haven’t found my people but for one hour a week I get a virtual hug, feel soothed and validated. Also and very importantly the show is non stop educational gifting!
Wonderful Who knew three strangers could make me feel such belonging.  Thank you.
Completely life changing These are my emotional support American white women and they hold my mental health in their hands
I love you all I love every single episode of this podcast it teaches me so much about myself, my life and relationships. You are all so open and wise and vulnerable, Thankyou from the bottom of my beating heart. Xxxx
Yaaaaass!!! I hear myself shouting out in agreement every single episode. This podcast is walking alongside my midlife like 3 awesome friends who invite their awesome guests to join the walk with advice, humour and endless compassion. I just finished listening to Glennon on loving the body…. Oooof. So powerful  I’m thinking of somatics and Damasio and feeling so much love for the vulnerable G who’s sharing her healing with us all. Abby’s love feels like the most grounding thing. Amanda you are me 😆 and also a wiser, calmer cleverer version 🙏 Thank you beloveds xxx
Love this podcast so much! I find it so relatable and often have to pause it to write things down because I don’t want to forget them! I find Glennon’s sharing of her experience of recovery so honest and vulnerable, I really appreciate it - thank you!
A must listen Love the combo of you all and Cheryl Strayed - perfect ❤️ Thank you 🙏
Love what you do ❤️ Thank you for all you do with this, so open, honest, powerful & light at the same time! Amazing 🙌
💗💗💗 You guys make my week so much brighter
The best girl friends you could hope to chat to Glennon, Abby & “Samanda” are like girlfriends who come to your house & chat about the most pertinent things in your kitchen.  They are honest, unafraid to be vulnerable, a great laugh and have fire in their bellies.  I look forward to each episode and listen back to my favourites.  Thank you for this space and Tish’s song… I’ve never yet managed to listen to it with a dry eye…
Thank you all I always rate your podcasts 5* but don’t leave comments. My adult daughter just WhatsApped me from 10,000 miles away to ask how I am. The question came just as your episode with Cheryl Strayed was ending. I’m a high school teacher 000s of miles from you all and I regularly read a passage from Tiny Beautiful Things to classes when it’s my turn to read with them. When Glennon made her usual end of podcast request for a written review after these life affirming, tiny things - your podcast, Cheryl Strayed, my daughter, my students being moved by a passage - how could I not finally submit a review? As I tell my students (whether or not they want to hear), despite all our privileges, life is still hard. Thank you all for making it easier and more joyous.
Life affirming This podcast makes me laugh, makes me think, and makes me feel less alone in facing the many hard things that have come my way. Thank you for your radical honesty.
Thank you for connecting us back to our humanity I simply love this podcast! You ladies absolutely rock and are bringing incredible guests that are inspiring , humans and do challenge the status quo of what we “commonly “ see in the world for how we should do life. Thank you! Keep going x
My heart feels bigger Difficulties of life tackled with empathy, hilarity and wonderful hosts and guests. I’m writing down so many quotes from these wise people to look back on when I’m doing a hard thing. This podcast has your back.
Feels like home I keep coming back every week to listen to We can do hard things, it  makes me feel less alone in dealing with hard things, we can all smile, laugh at ourself and figure out things together!! thank you!!! I LOVE YOUUUU   all the way from Italy🥰
I never miss this. This podcast is a must for me. It can sometimes be a hard listen but it is always a necessary listen for me. I’ve learnt so much. I laugh hard, I sometimes sob.  I pretty much always feel smarter though. I adore Glennon, Abby & Amanda.   100% recommend.
Transformation, Compassion & Companionship Sometimes you need to immerse yourselves in the vulnerability of others as they navigate the world. I keep these podcasts for moments when I am alone so I can soak it in. I frequently have to rewind certain moments to be sure something landed right, or to let it land again.   I’ve said Wow out loud with only dog to hear.  And you make me laugh.  If the above isn’t nice, as Kurt Vonnegut said understatedly, I don’t know what is.  These the companions we need.
My favourite podcast This is hands down my favourite podcast, and the only podcast I make time to listen to each week, and it literally soothes my soul with each episode 💕 I recommend it to others often, both personally and professionally (I’m a trauma-informed therapist)
This podcast is beautiful Amanda, Abby and Glennon, I appreciate you and this podcast so much. Thank you for helping me do hard things xxxx
Soul expanding My absolute favourite podcast! I learn new things every time! Even when it’s a subject I’ve already done a lot of thinking / reading / living about, the way they express things causes me to have new penny drop moments or deeper understanding of the issue or feeling at hand. Incredible guests! Beautiful bravery and vulnerability expressed with empathy and calmness. A gorgeous gorgeous corner of the internet thank you so much xxx
The BEST Podcast! I love WCDHTs so much! I look forward to every episode; my mind & heart are often expanded in ways I didn’t think possible.  Sending much love to all three of you amazing humans 🖤
Thanks Abby I absolutely love this podcast and never miss an episode. I was so moved by the 3 episodes recently with the Abby interviews. So brave and honest. I literally sobbed listening to her talk about the Christmas morning surprise. I always feel like I learn something valuable from this pod. Keep up the amazing work ladies 👏
This podcast is a lifeline of sanity for women (& their male partners) Dearest Glennon, Abby & Amanda, me and all my girlfriends are forever grateful for your three minds and the amazing souls you choose to invite onto your insightful podcast. Through it, I have ‘met’ almost all my new favourite minds and hearts, I’ve been nourished in the most important way possible and been continuously inspired beyond measure. THANK YOU, for your intentional selection of thoughts, ideas and voices that you share with us all. My favourite episode of late is the women at work one. It’s on the subject that is all I’ve been discussing with my husband and girlfriends for months, both as women, wives, mothers and professionals. Your work MATTERS in one of the most important ways possible. Keep going. With love from London, UK Lee Grant x
Abby made me do it I enjoy your podcast so much each week - I share episodes that have resonated with me, with my clients. With one client we talk almost exclusively in We Can Do Hard Things-isms - it’s our love language. Traditionally I’m far to lazy to write reviews, but Abby’s episodes compelled me to say how much I appreciated hearing her (yours, if you’re reading this) story. Normally I feel Abby’s grounded presence and sound advice throughout each episode. She chimes in thoughtfully, mindfully and sensitively to other people’s stories. It really was a TR to hear Abby in her own words - and what beautiful words. Thank you for sharing yourself with such vulnerability and courage
My weekly fav podcast Such a great podcast - I feel like I’m the 4th sister ( incl. Abby as a sister lol) in the round 😁 always exited when I see new episode dropping on Tuesday & Thursday mornings! Its warm, real, raw, honest, cosy and comforting, insightful, and soulful. And soooo, sooo thought provoking by ‘keeping it real’. In a world where so many of us create our own new life blue prints because no one we know has lived a truly authentic and aligned life, Glennon, Abby, Sister and guests provide guidance by sharing of their own journeys of finding truths despite societal distractions, paths they found through emergence from numbing, and just so much love. Love for others, their chose families, their kids, and first and foremost, the love and care for themselves and the many shapes and forms it comes in. I can wholeheartedly say this podcast changed my life. The amount of tears I have cried, giggled, wondered, laughed out loud (Amanda, you’re not just mega smart but bloody hilarious!!).  Last weeks episode with Abby’s story.. Wow! Full on crying! The magic you bring out in each other, Glennon and Abby, it’s powerful beyond means. What a great thing the universe did, putting you in a room together that day at the Librarian’s conference.. 🤩 I’m so grateful for Glennon, Abby, and Amanda’s vulnerability, honesty, emotional intelligence, and humility. Thank you for helping thousands and thousands gain insight into how to use and hold the metaphorical shovel to build their own path. I love you brilliant lot 💛
More diverse hard things This is my favourite podcast. I listen to it when I’m sad, sick, overwhelmed and lonely. In the bath, on my way to work, while I’m doing the washing up or going for a run. I love these women.   AND. And. I want to hear what they have to say to those who disagree with them. Who bring a different side to the arguments they are so aligned with. I want to experience hard things in the context of the HARDEST of things: to sit with someone who is on the other side of whatever polarising line has been drawn in any given debate. To emphasise with the ‘enemy’. To LISTEN in order to really HEAR what they have to say.   As a teacher, now in my first year of retraining as a person centred psychotherapist, I know my journey is looking more and more like a radical dismantling of who I am based on the opinions/beliefs I hold alone. And trying to look toward the ‘other’, for more humanity, more understanding and ultimately more love.   So Abby, Glennon and Sister. My most beloved of women. I will continue to love, listen to and recommend your podcast. AND. And. I hope one day to hear a conversation with you and those from whom your paths diverge. The truest of true hard things I think.
Insightful, emotional, uplifting Love this podcast
Incredible Crying my heart out. What a beautiful, raw, real story. I don’t know how it would be possible NOT to love you, Abby. So brave. So powerful. ⭐️❤️
Wonderful I cannot express how life enhancing and wonderful this podcast is. Human, warm and accepting of all. I love it, keep on doing what you are doing y’all. Proud to be a member of the Podsquad.
What a trio! Long time UK listener of the show and always loved Glennon’s work! But I’m so glad this show became the three of you (and the brilliant guests you bring on). Amanda is simply a gift to the world, and I could listen to her wisdom and insights all day long. And Abby’s latest episodes! 🥹 As someone who’d lean more toward ‘glennon’ on the Glennon- Abby scale, I didn’t expect to love and be able to relate to so much of Abby’s story! So glad it was a 3-parter! 🫶   Thank you all for your rawness, realness, kindness and just general good people-ness. This podcast is the perfect balance of warm hug, activism, sisterhood, hope and mundane queer domesticity representation I often need in a world that can let’s be honest feel pretty bleak!
Abby’s Christmas Miracle Thankyou for sharing such profound and emotional thinking and experience.
This podcast is in my dating profile… …because half of my sentences seem to start with, “I heard this on a podcast and it really resonated.” That podcast is always We Can Do Hard Things.   Every episode has enriched my life and deepened my understanding of myself. I’ve also laughed aloud many times.   Highly recommend.
Love I have listened to all of your podcasts, and find them so interesting, sometimes challenging and always honest and compelling. But todays Abby 2…floods of tears and appreciation of her sharing her story that in many ways (not the sporting prowess!) made me comprehend mine… thank you.
Abi - I love you Sitting in my kitchen in London making breakfast and crying my eyes out listening to your story, ABI!!! Thank you for being this big bundle of love and spreading that love to your family, friends and pod squaders around the world.  Xx
Love Thank you
Love, love, love! Such beautiful wisdom, honesty and love shared in this podcast! Just listened to Abby’s story part 1 and had to say thank you for sharing who you are!
Exceptional and important Thank you
Just outstanding! If you’re breathing you need to be listening.
Such a special show Listening to these wonderful and inclusive humans is so life affirming.  Thank you for all you do in the world.
Just everything I didn’t think it was possible to love this podcast anymore than I already did until I heard the Gloria Steinem episode ♥️. Thank you to my three neoteric superheroes. For being my bedtime voices, thought companions and for giving language to the unspoken things I’ve wrestled without quite being able to define. Please keep going , I don’t know what I would do without you xx
Soul food Love this podcast, love the deep honest conversations and love that I always learn something new! Thank you! Xxx
I know it’s not therapy… but it feels like therapy. Love every episode.
My number 1 podcast ❤️ I have never missed an episode of WCDHT…Tuesday/Thursday my AirPods are in and I go a long walk to listen…I’m obsessed with Glennon, Abby & Sister, I laugh and cry with them. They have taught me so much, my mind has been opened to so many things. I can’t thank them enough for the work they do. Feels like a free therapy session! Untamed honestly changed my life, this podcast makes me a better person! X
Nowhere I’d rather be than in a hot bath with these phenomenal women in my ears and heart Beautiful and complicated truth and nothing but the truth ❤️
My fave podcast My fave podcast I listen  to
The only podcast I listen to I know it sounds strange, but this is the only podcast I listen to now. Glennon, Abby and Amanda talk about the stuff I want to hear about and they do it in the most warm, candid, loving way. They are a grounding thread that weaves through my week, a ‘Touch Tree’ for ideas and values that means I show up better in my life. This is more than just a podcast, it’s support, it’s healing. I love it.
Love this pod! A must listen for me, twice a week. Such interesting, thought-provoking conversations! Raw, funny and just the best trio ever. LOVE this pod! ♥️♥️♥️
A must for my week Grounding, emotional, relevant, delicious, inspiring genius! This podcast is a must for my week! I learn so much about myself through the conversations with all the amazing humans. ThankYOU. 100 stars!!!!
Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best… I think (being in Scotland with time differences etc.) I listen as each episode launches. It is such a big part of my week. The real, raw stories, the emotion, the humility, the humour… A real community that I feel a distant part of!  The only thing that’s better are weeks with bonus episodes…  Too much?! I hope not… I love it!  V x
Life changing This podcast has changed the way I human. It’s the highlight of my week listening and I have gained so much insight.
We can do hard things This podcast has changed my life. I really mean changed my life. I love it and do not know what I did without it. Bless you all for you x
Got me through the hardest year of my life Thank you ❤️
Friends in my ears To say I love this podcast is to diminish what this show means to me. Going through hard times in the last few years Glennon, Abbey and Amanda have been my wonderful supportive, funny, educational and inspiring friends in my ears. My precious companions in loneliness, sleepless nights and despair. I have learnt it’s ok to be myself and to love me in my unique divine weirdness. I have been inspired to do hard things and have awkward conversations that have brought unexpected harmony and happiness to my life. Thank you from the depths of my heart. I love you.
Stunning Love this podcast series! It speaks right to my soul and makes my little brain rethink what I’ve known, in the best possible way. Always worth a listen no matter what!
A hug in a podcast Love this show- eminently human, kind and wise… just like all of the presenters ❤️
Very moving episode Just listened to the episode with Glennon’s diagnosis of anorexia . This year my daughter developed anorexia and I came to realise the eating disorder that I thought I had left behind in my teens had never really gone and like Glennon I had simply incorporated it into my own sense of self. Good luck to both of us in our recovery x
Though provoking episode This episode has helped me set my relationship Goals for 2023 😍
Best thing since slice bread Life is too bloody hard not to listen to this podcast! It gets me through and I am so, so grateful that it exists.
Great Really enjoy listening
Love you guys!! I just want to say how happy it makes me listening to your podcast! I have so many laugh out loud moments when I listen to you 3 awesome human beings chat!   Thank you for bringing so much joy   E X
The Episode That Wasn’t This was so good and so real.  That’s what I love about this show, it’s raw and real.  I was moved to tears when Abby talked about how women have been marginalised.  And thank God that we are talking about this now and that women like you don’t stand for any crap! Thank you 🙏 I love you.
Well now … As an old mum of a young girl who’s growing up with very different role models than I did, I came out of Tuesday’s episode feeling deeply grateful for the existence of Geena Davis on the planet. Today’s episode left me feeling fired up … and slightly envious … wishing I had you guys to have MY back. Then I realised … I DO. Thank you SO much for your podcast and putting this stuff out there for us all. I’ll do my best to pay it forward 🙂 x
Glennon, Abby & Amanda have got my back Love it. Like a deep hug from a true friend twice a week. A friend who also makes you belly laugh, knows all your weaknesses & dark thoughts and STILL loves you. Sending so much love from the UK. Please come over and do a live! ❤️
Love love love Incredible podcast, I love it!
Amazing depth and fun I have learned things. I have cried. I have laughed.  I am grateful.  You are all wonderful pioneers, stretching our souls. Thank you.
Theme Tune I just love every single episode and can’t get enough! Just listened to the latest one but where’s Tish’s song gone from the end? Such a beautiful track and I love listening after every episode! Thank you all for being amazing and being there for me! ❤️
A hug to the soul I wake up hoping it’s podcast day, because every episode is life changing in its own way.  I thank you, admire you, appreciate you.
“Here is the world. Beautiful and terrible things will happen. Don’t be afraid.” I love this Podcast. It came to me at a time in my life when I felt I was losing my purpose. I’d forgotten how to be me. How to feel. How to be. Intermingled with sporadic listening of episodes I then read Glennon’s Untamed - the book that started it all and it was like a firework factory went off inside my body.   I’ve gone back to episode 1 of this podcast because I want to grow alongside all three of these wonderful ladies over the time they’ve invested. So I’m re listening to episodes which is providing new learnings and understanding.   I also run marathons and pick random episodes to listen to whilst training - it’s like a surprise waiting for me. There’s tears and laughter in every episode - much like training and running a marathon! It literally reminds me as I take every step that we really can do hard things.   For me this podcast is a reminder that when we come together and share, that the world truly is brutiful. I hope that anyone reading my review loves this show as much as I do. And in Glennon’s words, if you don’t… it’s ok.   Much love x
Always extraordinary This is simply my favourite podcast ever. The combination of Glennon, Abby and Amanda is perfect - each brings something unique and wonderful to the conversation. I have also been inspired by and learned something from every single guest they’ve welcomed onto the podcast and am always looking forward to the next one. They are always exceptional and intimate conversations. Thank you - this podcast has comforted me in difficult times - made me laugh, made me cry and helped me understand more about the world.
Thank you Glennin, Abbey and Amanda I am trying to find tools on how to fix hyper-arousal/vigilance - I find peace and stillness and laughter here for a couple of hours every week. It’s a start. I love you. Thank you.
Drowning out of  persistent thoughts Brilliant episode saying we all do it but no need to tolerate it . Amanda talked of each though being an assignment and after that mind blowing insight I think I can banish them because I don’t like assignments !!!!!  Glennon , thanks for telling me why 5 pages of reading make no sense sometimes    We go forward with you wonderful women guiding.   Soooo helpful because you bring such clarity and that brings more calm and we all need calm 😜.  Sending an English hug from across the pond
Part of my week Glennon, Abby, and Amanda have become permanent fixtures in my weekly landscape, supporting me to navigate my life with more compassion and awareness.
Waving from the UK I love this insightful, funny, warm, powerful podcast. Thank you ❤️
Positive and insightful I’m really enjoying the podcasts and loving how thought provoking there are. Thank you so much for sharing your profound wisdom and guiding us so well with your straight talking and sage advice.  I particularly loved the Sheryl Strayed episode, she’s a force for goodness, positivity and the ultimate truth.  A wonderful listener and advice giver!
Motivating Women in this Generation and the Next We can do hard things is incredible, language to make you think and love others. Helps me to think about how I’m shaping my own and my daughters life. I adore this.
Carson Tueller is everything - incredible human, wonderful episode So many beautiful, authentic, and wise truths from the amazing Carson. Thank you for this magical episode. I LOVE your podcast, but EVERYONE should listen to this one! Thank you 🙏
I love these women and this pod This podcast is so good. It’ll teach you stuff and make you laugh and feel all the feelings. Listen to all the episodes. And if you feel sad, listen to the embarrassing stories episode. It’ll make you cry laugh 🥰
Every Episode good value I am discovering every episode is informative, engaging, valuable.  You are giving a gift to us listeners.  Thank you so much..
Unapologetically Awesome I listen & cherish every episode & I adore Amanda, Abby & Glennon.
My absolute fave WCDHT is my absolute favourite podcast and now an integral part of my week. I read another review where the reviewer said she has been going through a difficult season in her life and that Glennon, Amanda and Abby are helping her through it. I feel EXACTLY the same and it helps me to feel less alone. Please keep doing what you do WCDHT crew - you are so needed and cherished. Thank you.
DBT I’m a DBT therapist in the UK & episode 24 really resonated with me. Aside from that I love your honesty & applaud what you are all doing. Feeling that I have a ‘we can do hard things’ tribe. I gift ‘untamed’ whenever I can. I also genuinely feel stronger as I approach my 50th year & credit you all with some of that. Time is of the essence, as reminded in your most recent episode on death & dying. Thank you 🙏 Sue Mclure
An unconquerable ray of sunshine in my week I can’t think of anything else in my week that so reliably makes me laugh, think and feel less alone. Thank you for this amazing ongoing discussion.
Life changing guidance Honest, authentic and incredibly on point conversations that strongly instill that we are not alone on this journey called life. I know I will replay a lot of these episodes as they have given me insight, confidence and a lot of peace during a tough season in my life. Couldn’t recommend this more. Thank you Glennon, Abby, Amanda and your team. You rule my driving time all over Cape Town, South Africa!
The wonders So eye opening and helpful. This has been the best yet  I have just listened to the interview with Brene twice and then again while making notes in my journal! I read untamed and felt it spoke to me directly and now I have gained so much from this podcast series I cannot thank you enough.
Thank you Thank you for this episode and for my first introduction to Dr Yaba Blay. I saw a clip shared on LinkedIn and was drawn here to listen to the whole episode. This is so valuable, thank you. As a white woman I was lazy for too long around this. Care and figure it out!
You need this podcast in your life Every human being needs to listen to this podcast. I have felt kind of alone since I came into this world, and listening to Glennon I no longer feel like that.
Great work Hi Glen, Abby and sister I am a born Iranian who has spend half of my life in Tehran and the other half in london and I am close to forty. I have been in a long term marriage with an African man who I had been desperately in love with for 20 years. I have been listening to your podcast since the day I found out about my husband infidelity. His many years of narcissistic abuse has effected me in so many ways and levels that I was in a debt of despair and a grief for a year. But with your help, this podcasts and your work in the subjects I had became untamed and now I am looking after me and my two children and found the Chita in me. I am finally getting a divorce after 12 years of marriage and will continue being a good person and a good parent that I am and serving everyone I love! I fill that all of these subject are very relevant to all of your listeners with all of our diversity, culture and circumstances. These events has either happened, happening or will happen to any of us at different time in our life. Interestingly enough, your episodes come to my aid exactly when I am in need of a help. Would like to really thank you three. And your commitment in serving all women globally. The world had been waiting for you for ever A side note and a request: Would you be able to bring on Dr. Armani to the show on the subject of co-parenting with Malignant Narcissistic person. Pegah S  Also about episode 70. The hardest thing  I do have a trichotillomania disorder which increased after my traumatic time in the last two years.  But I do occasionally have had these episode when I also feel immensely sad and these are the times when I am more into my spirit and I do also agree that I like you would explain it in a spiritual way. In every occasion I think I receive warnings from my angels and because if it’s impact i show these feelings in a physical disorder.
Love Just listened to the most recent episode so far but I love it. Found myself nodding and agreeing all the way through and thinking, I need to make a note of that! Keep on with what you’re all doing and I can’t wait to listen to the rest :)
Life changing It has taken me too long to get on here and write a review, having been a devoted pod-squadder from the start. But I’m here now. Untamed and We Can Do Hard Things have transformed how I see myself and the world around me and the learning I have done has made me a better human. I listen whilst running and I regularly have to stop to take a deep breath, laugh uncontrollably, or make some notes to return to when I am not a sweaty mess. Glennon, Abby and Amanda feel like family to me now and this podcast makes you feel like you are sat on the sofa chatting to them. Thank you thank you thank you.
Open, truthful, helpful, raw Thank you, actually.
Lucy Davies Pure magic for the soul, heart and head, thank you for this. It is my safe place.   (Thank you Tish too, for your beautiful words and music.)
Thank you I listen to this podcast religiously, and it has changed the way I go about my life.  It’s taught me to be brave and kind and listen to myself and make me feel empowered.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Live saving! Thank you so much for this podcast. Feels warm and every time. So much of what you share each week is now in my mind and vocabulary. I am so grateful. And your daughter’s beautiful song seems to have moved into my head as I find myself singing it often. So much gratitude to you all xx
Feels like Home: Validates & Soothes Glennon, Abby & Amanda, thank you for your gift of a podcast. The topics you choose & the words you say touch me & reach me on a deep level. Listening to the 3 of you go deep then light (all in one breath) is just soul soothing to me. I laugh, I cry & I have so many “wow moments”. I’m learning so much. What’s amazing is…a “niggle” of a feeling / thought that I can’t quite grasp within myself is right here in the podcast with you three… fully thought out & dissected explained on the show. It’s like a mirror & I feel validated. Even the “hard” topics feel easy with the 3 of you discussing them. Thank you for all the truths & the real & the permission & the smiles. I listen & I feel like I’m home with my people. What a gift. Michelle xx
Real conversations I love this podcast. It’s refreshing to listen to real, honest and vulnerable conversations about deep topics that most people shy away from. It makes me feel like I’m not so alone in the world. Thank you for showing up and sharing each week.
Twice weekly comfort This podcast brings me so much comfort and connection - like having an extra dose of ‘Untamed’ fed  to me twice a week. There are so many YES! moments each episode. Glennon, Abby and Amanda each bring their own unique take to the topics discussed and really prompt me to think about my own life, relationships and the wider world in new and different ways. Plus they have some incredible guests. Really hope they can one day come to the UK and do a live show.
Thanks Glennon and Abby and Sister Beautiful music intro.  Beautiful honest podcast  Thank-you
Absolutely brilliant! I was introduced to your podcasts by a dear friend that thought I would love them as I work within mental health as a counselling therapist.  I am always interested in ‘real’ experiences that are provided in a real way.  The podcasts are so rich with your life experiences and oh so valuable.  I am hooked on the podcasts and will be purchasing the books that my friend has also recommended.  I wish you and your family all the best things that life may bring.
Life changing!! These conversations have literally changed my life. Thank you so much for sharing you and your lives so authentically with the world.
Brilliant, honest, important. Love this ❤️ I have only listened to one and already need this. And Tish’s song! How do we download that? Incredible XXX
Thought provoking, engaging and uplifting. Glennon, Abby, Amanda and their guests bring all sorts of different magic to the table in honest, brave, unfiltered and often very funny ways. It’s like having your best friends telling you that it’s ok to feel all the feels, that it’s ok to laugh through your tears, and it’s ok to do what you need to do to heal. Thought provoking, engaging and uplifting. Just what we need in these uncertain times.
Totally wonderful “A clubhouse for the brave”… this podcast lifts me up and opens me up to face the world with strength and a feeling of community. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda - you are utterly wonderful xxx
The ONLY podcast Look forward to this enlightening and supportive podcast every Tuesday and Thursday here in the UK. Thank you Glennon, Amanda & Abby. It brings such joy and comfort in such a difficult time globally xxx
I’m waiting for each new episode to drop I literally need this in my life right now! I look forward to each episode where I can sit with a cup of tea or listen in my car and have a feeling of connection and community with other women across the world all with the same hard stuff going on. It makes me feel less alone and has been better and more insightful than any therapy. It’s funny too. And heart warming. I’d be so sad without it and without my podsquad. Xxx
Life enhancing! I really get so much from this podcast, I have become a podcast evangelist, if I am chatting to a friend i just point them here, knowing we are all facing hard things.  The title alone gets me through moments.  Thank you all for being vulnerable and raw.  I have just listened to the most recent, which enlightened me to realising that the diversity between your voices has the capability to give permission to just be your own you.  I process in different ways dependant on my mood, and hearing Abby say that she can only do off the cuff is great for the moment it all becomes overwhelming to hear yourself unable to plan a sentence, much like writing this review! All 3 of your voices have a great purpose to define that there is no linear way to face hard things! Thank you
My favourite time of week! This podcast makes me feel less alone and like I can take on anything. Thanks Glennon, Abby and Amanda ❤️
Me Time This often seems like the only hour of pure ‘me’ time I give myself each week. Really thankful for each and every episode. Love Love Love.
Love this! I rarely get round to writing a review but for this podcast I simply had to! As Glennon would put it I am ‘dripping with children’ over here in the UK and after a somewhat intense, fulfilling but also stifling teacher career I find myself suddenly awake in the night after dealing with my little people exploring the inside of my brain. These three have the type of deep & meaningful conversations I long for everyday, I have magpied many of their phrases to help articulate the goings on of life and can’t seem to stop listening and re listening! Thank you.
A genuine eye opening joy These 3 women are warm, funny, inspiring, open and wonderfully human. Thank you for all you do! I love being part of your pod squad! xx
Thankful My first review. My favourite podcast. The podcast equivalent of a giant squishy hug. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Sister for consistently reminding us we are not alone and we can do hard things. Your words helped me through an extremely difficult divorce and in those moments when I felt truly isolated and on the floor I would pop you guys on and feel immediately comforted by your beautiful observations on life. A mahoosive thank you from Northumberland, UK.
Love but wish they had less guests I love Glennon, Abby and Sister. They are undoubtedly absolutely brilliant! My personal preference would be less guests, I prefer episodes that are chats between the three of them. Adding people somehow dilutes the beauty of what they’ve created as a three. Anyway, that’s just my personal preference!
Universal conversations I’ve listened in my car, in my kitchen and living room. This time it’s 2am in the UK and I’m recovering from a hysterectomy, in my bed unable to sleep. Truly honest and caring voices from this team and their guests remind me that even at this hour I am not alone and there is real community in spirit.
New level of insight and a question This latest episode clarified something for me that I so needed to hear. To ask yourself how you truly feel about small things so you get to feel trust in yourself for the big things. Absolute game changer. Thank you all for highlighting this. And a question for you if I may please. Would you consider covering the subject of baby loss through abortion? The long lasting after-effects, the crippling guilt, the loss that can’t be expressed if the abortion was undertaken without family or friends being aware ... I know this is incredibly difficult but if anyone can air this with integrity it’s you three amazing and inspirational women. With love and deep gratitude from a pod squadder. Katherine X
So frikken important to my life I love this podcast and these three smart, beautifully honest and hilarious women (and every guest) so much. It is pure light and joy twice a week in my life. Thank you 💕
Getting me through hard things In 2014 I lost a baby boy during pregnancy. In 2017, my daughter was still born at term.  In 2020, I chose to leave a toxic marriage. In 2021, I am stronger than ever. The ember that has always struggled to glow inside me & at times has felt completely extinguished, is starting to burn, I am trying every damn day to be the oxygen & warmth it needs. It will rage in to the fiercest fire as I become increasingly untamed and live the kind of life that every human is born deserving. This podcast has changed my life. I feel, through this podcast that Glennon, Abby & Amanda have walked with me through some of the darkest moments of my life. I am so grateful to the three of them for this podcast. So much love. F x
Phenomenal Thank you for opening my eyes, grounding me, and thank you Tish for the beautiful song. I can’t get through the week without listening to your show.
Obsessed Thanks guys for helping learn how to adult properly ❤️ I appreciate learning from your mature, empathetic and loving approach to life.
Another UK friend Same , same , same ( seeing review of ‘UK friend ‘. )   The best podcast ever.  Total game changer. Please don’t stop talking about hard things.  Not enough words to describe how much this feeds my soul and heart. Thank you !
Thank you for holding space for me to explore being me Being Brave…. Absolutely meant doing something I didn’t want to do once upon a time.  I was listening your podcast, I’ve been listening since you started and love that the three of you give me space to open my heart and soul to explore being me. When I had just finished listening to ‘Being Brave’ I pressed to open my social media and saw this quote:  “Come with me where dreams are born, and time is never planned” (Peter Pan)   “Never planned” was once such an anxiety inducing prospect for me.  My mind was wired from school  that if time wasn’t planned it wasn’t productive.   For years anything that went to plan was a positive, a step in the right planned direction. If something came up which wasn’t planned (there were a lot of somethings!!) it was something I had to tidy up, work round until I got back on my planned route and if I didn’t I would label myself a failure.  Always my inner child wanted to be safe and just play, explore, be in the day… but she was little and not worth listening to… I had things that I ‘needed’ to plan and do; there were steps to follow written down by someone who knew the ‘right way’.  Recognising this passed wiring in myself was the first step to changing my mindset travelling through clinical depression.  “Never planned” to me now doesn’t mean never thinking on the future, be that today,  tomorrow or in the years to come… “Never planned” means pointing my feet in the direction of what feels right for me every day and being mentally relaxed enough (enough changes daily- still working on it) to take a step however small on that day…a step…back to bed for a 10min meditation, signing up for a course, saying yes to a group craft session, making coffee, saying no thanks that’s not for me, making a healthy dinner, getting to know my clients, jumping in puddles, hugging loved ones, watching the flames flicker in the fire or a waterfall cascading down the mountain, booking a trip, running a bath, sending that email, doing a bit more research, swimming in the sea with my children, crying it out, journalling, making, doing, laughing, playing…. This is where my dreams are born.  Listening to me feels really brave  When I first saw this quote I thought “yes please but that’s so scary”… still working on that mindset, that initially reaction… after time to dive into my thought process… which you have helped me do… “yes please I am so jumping in with both feet or are we flying ‘second to the right, and straight on till morning’   There are no words that feel full of enough gratitude to express my thanks to you all
I can now do hard things!! Glennon, sister and Abby, you have become the three friends I did not know I needed. Your podcast has become a twice weekly escape for me, where I feel seen.  I laugh along, cry and learn each time! Thank you for being real, honest and raw! I love you guys! From the UK ❤️
Unmissable and Useful Whether you’ve come because you know and love Glennon’s work, or just trying something new. Never have I actually WAITED for the next episode to come out of a podcast like I do this. Amanda is a real highlight here too - she, Abby and Glennon are gorgeous people the world needs more of.
Great at first then a surprise. I loved this podcast at the beginning with Glennon and Amanda being the host. I can really relate to Glennon and love how Amanda brings in research and another perspectives on the topics.  However all of a sudden it’s suddenly gone from Glennon and Amanda, to Glennon, Abby and Amanda podcast.  I just feel alittle disappointed, it’s like meeting up with your best mates and your all excited to be catching up with them. Then you arrive and one of your friends has invited a friend with out you knowing and you are stuck talking to them all night and it’s not the time you hoped for.  That is my only downfall of this podcast, just wish it was mentioned that Abby was going to remain a host.
Can’t wait for each new episode! Oh Glennon, Amanda and Abby, you make me so happy. I am so impatient to listen to each new episode of this podcast, it is uplifting and educational and reassuring and friendly and makes you feel less alone in this one wild and precious life.  Hard to pick my favourite episode (and I have recommended so many to so many people and quoted so much from them during every chat with my friends that I’m not sure where my brain ends and “we can do hard things” podcast starts) but the People Pleasing episode no.29 had me in stitches laughing… for these reasons: 1. When Glennon made me feel so seen when she chose to stay on the sofa and read a book rather than play with her kids and make precious family memories.  2. When Sister describes her “morning regime” which is exactly the same as mine.  Just amazing, through and through. Love them all.
Wonderful! I’ve never listened to podcasts before - I absolutely love this podcast and never miss an episode! The conversations and real and raw, but informative and soul-nourishing. I loved Untamed, and I love this podcast too.
Love them! I absolutely adore these podcasts. Having read untamed during the pandemic and passed the book on to every cheetah I knew, I have followed Glennon. The podcasts discuss a whole range of topics & make me feel like I’m not going crazy in this weird world.
Goddamn Cheetahs Glennon, Abby & Amanda - your podcast is the highlight of my week (and now twice weekly). Thank you all so much for all you bring. I feel like I should say something more articulate but I’ll leave that to you. All my love from England 🤍🐆
You put into words how I think. I love this podcast. You help me to realise that I am not alone and there is not anything wrong with how I am. I really laughed when you told us about the woman at the cafe who didn’t know you. I love that you are intense and until you said this I realised that I often apologise for being intense. I so am and I realised that this is absolutely okay. Like you I am highly sensitive and now celebrate and don’t apologise for this at all.  I have loads I could say because you are defo my second therapist and your podcasts and Untamed help me in living my ‘intense’ life and as I work hard to overcome a trauma past and claim my Goddam cheetah!!   Thank you for your work and thank you also to Abi and Sister, together you are an awesome team with so much wisdom.
Get back to Glennon Doyle This was fabulous in the beginning as a glennon doyle podcast. Now it’s an exclusive conversation, awful squeaky bossy sister often shouting and Abby as the naughty girl. This is not what it was and it was wise and wonderful. I now rarely get to the end
Thanks to you I am able to teach my 5 year old grandaughter to be a Cheetah I am absolutely loving the podcast, prior to this I listened to Glennon on every podcast I could. I love the cheetah story- the polar bear story and so much more. I also listened Abby’s commencement speech (wolf pack) not realising that Abby was Glennon and Abby I was like wow. I can relate so much to Abby- not just because I play football (at 43)  Especially in the podcast when you discussed relationships.  I also love that your sister there too and adds amaZing value to every discussion.  My girls are grown up but being a gran - I am so desperate to get the message right for my grandaughter. Every single topic discussed helps me do this. Thank you 🙏❤️ ps my biggest worry is I teach her to do what I done and leave herself behind- then every other day she gives me an indication that she is kind but not tamed 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Fighting well I am so on team glennon on the absent minded stuff. Razors, keys, undrunk coffee - i totally understand. But could it be adult ADHD?
Why can’t you do everyday though? Just want to say how much I love listening to you gab to each other. Please keep thinking of all the things and talking about them.  🙌🏼
Nourishment for the soul I come away after listening to these podcasts feeling like my soul has been nourished. I laugh, cry, gasp and learn during every episode and feel like my direction has shifted a little bit on the path to finding my true self each time. This is no exaggeration, this podcast is food for the soul!
Lands between the eyes like a bullet I have loved LOVED every episode of this pod cast. I share it freely !    Amanda, Glennon and Abby - I love your thoughts, energy and soul.  I’m finding a power deep within that I can trust and hear because you’ve validated us as women.   Thank you also for helping me understand and truly see the heart of my gender fluid daughter in a way that is all encompassing.    This is brave work, you inspire us all.   Amanda
Life changing I knew it all anyway but I needed someone to say it in a way that resonated and Glennon, Abby and Sister you have done this in the most profound and powerful way, you have without question changed my life and I cannot express my gratitude enough, love you all.
Love Love Love Glennon, Abby and Amanda, I love your podcast, thank you for your time, honesty and now two episodes per week.   I think with today’s struggles and stresses.. “We can do hard things” just confirms we can!   Thank you guys, Love Maria all the way from the UK ❤️🙏🥰 xxxxx
Life lessons Adulting learning at its best, I think these podcasts (along with Untamed) make me a better person! Thank you so much ❤️Also lovveee Tish’s song ❤️
Truly wonderful It’s so funny, so deep, so affirming and I just love these amazing women! I want to dive into my phone and have the conversation with them all. I can’t live without it now!
Aural ambrosia for the soul This is funny. It is heart-wracking. It is warm. It is honest. It is real. It is life-affirming. And it is what the world needs. Thank you Glennon, Amanda, Abby - and your families. This is healing.
Thank you, sweet Jesus Thank you, sweet Jesus for Glennon, Sister Amanda and Abby! At last, some common sense in this world. Each week, more sense than I have ever heard in 31 years on Gods green earth. Thank you for allowing us into your worlds, lives, hearts and minds. It is truly a privilege to listen and if I wouldn’t get arrested for breach of the peace or something, I would have ‘We Can Do hard Things’ playing on a boom box, for the whole of England to hear.
Please do a podcast a day Such wonderful, witty and intelligent conversations and insights - I could listen to one every day!
We  Can Do Hard Things I didn’t like this podcast at first it felt to American and distant (I am English ) but it grew on me and I now find it very intelligent and compassionate. Thank you ❤️
Parenting episode Oh Glennon, the intro to this episode really hit my vulnerable spot. Thank you, thank you for speaking this truth. I regularly feel the panic and guilt of not enjoying my children and mother role EVERY second of EVERY day. In those challenging moments I repeat “I am grateful” until I think God believes me whilst at the same time feeling breathless from the constant demands from my 4 year old. Thank you for seeing me ❤️
THE Best! Wow! You are both amazing. Inspirational discussions, so rare to listen without the judgy judgement! Thank you for walking your own talk with so much courage it’s contagious. We can do hard things ❤️ #feelingempowered
Sibo Leorah Love your podcast. It gives me life.This episode was for me. I'm listening to this after I had sat with my 8 yr old when she cried, with snot and all. She kept saying she feels ugly and fat and she just wants to die. At some point I just cried with her
♥️♥️♥️ Even your voice gives me comfort. You are sharing love and compassion. I live in London and this is the kind of podcast I need in a cloudy day ☺️ You are amazing and your way to talk about your own things is an example and motivates me to be kinder to myself.  Thank you for being you 🥰
Anxiety & Fun I choose these episodes 1st because the meant something to me and I was so right to! Thank you Glennon for always being open honest and you. Your experience and words just make me feel like I’m not alone but equally make me sit up listen and create action. Amazing ❤️⭐️❤️
Thank you Glennon, sister and Abby are the best. Please keep up the podcast, you instil hope and joy into my life every week and I love you xxxxx
Great podcast I love this podcast. It covers great topics in a really accessible way but for the love of God please pronounce his name Craig not Creg 🤣
A podcast that reminds me of a really good & important therapy session I am a counselling psychologist and these topics and the way they are discussed are so important. So much of what we humans quest is the notion of “am I worthy?” This podcast covers a range of topics linked to it and so well! Keep up the good work. Love from England!
Love in podcast form I love this podcast, it’s so relevant to our lives. I love her writing and I love their talking and I love the inquiry’s they seek to explore.
Best friend Glennon is authentic and speaks her truth. These conversations and warm and welcoming and make me feel supported. I definitely have new podcast best friends in Glennon and her sister. For those who often walk in vulnerable waters, I recommend this podcast
Join the Pod Squad It’s like the weekly therapy session you never knew you needed. I have never connected with a podcast more! So real, so relatable, so true. Everyone needs a Pod Squad to work on the homework from Glennon and Sister.
Conflict Resolution Is your conflict style breaking your relationship-yes! Thank you Glennon, thank you Abby,  thank you sister! Your open and honesty during this podcast has really helped me realise and tackle a current situation between out son and my husband and I. I’m a ‘peace keeper’ my husband a ‘peace maker’ with the firm believe that an omelette isn’t made without breaking a few eggs! Having that ‘bullet proof jacket’ and knowing that we all want conflict resolution with respect for all parties without going after our Achilles heal out of anger and frustration. Thank you, we can certainly do hard things xx
THE BEST PODCAST EVER I have no words. If you love glennon and her books, then you will adore this! This is like an extension of untamed that I am so incredibly grateful for. When I finished untamed I felt an emptiness because I enjoyed it so much. Now I have this I’m so thrilled about it! Thank you glennon and sister soooo much
#teamglennon LOVE you all but had to give Glennon some support here 😂
Soul reaching The Overwhelm episode literally spoke to my soul, what a fantastic discussion and so truthful and honest. It resonated with me fully and I will look to action things from it, thank you so much.
Brilliant Simply brilliant. Invest a bit of time in yourself and listen to these brave, wise women xxx
You are my light! Your truthfulness and openness is everything!
THE Podcast we all needed but didn’t know I have loved Glennon since I read Untamed (I have not read her other books yet) I started to follow her since and she just doesn’t EVER disappoint. She is helping me grow, be truer to myself and basically untame myself. This podcast is speaking the truth, forgetting about shame and giving us (their listeners)the permission to do the same. I love Glennon, Sister and Abby like I want to be part of their gang so bad!!! 🤣
Love this podcast!! Such a wonderful podcast. Every episode speaks to me. I love their honesty and openness.
I can do hard things. I can. Inspiring. Moving. Timely. Supportive. Encouraging. Funny. Inquisitive. Honest. Thought provoking. Real. Compassionate.  Getting me through my things.
Beautifully honest podcast I’m a big fan of Glennon Doyle so was delighted when this podcast landed. I love how they tackle issues in everyday life, not holding back with using their own experiences. I always come away from listening to her podcast feeling rejuvenated. I really recommend it.
Addicted Well—one of the better things to be drawn to in life ;-) Absolutely love listening to Glennon & Amanda’s discussions & zero-judgement wisdom & insights. I always leave with a shift in perspective & new idea to wonder through. Love!
Love you ever ever more Thank you for this! Thank you for you. Glenon I am so grateful for you. Inspiration to all of me.  The song, Tish, oh wow, We Can so Hard Things, is my most favourite song ever.   I just sat on the sofa with my friend, who is at rock bottom, the tears steaming down our faces, listing, again and again. Comfort and hope.   Heart blown wide open.
The podcast of the year! What a treat to listen to on my commute to work or time away from my kids. Love the topics discussed. Glennon and Sister are so wise, funny and honest. If I wasn’t lucky enough to read Untamed now I have the privilege of listening to this. Thank you!
Amazingly insightful & helpful It’s not ‘what if’ but ‘what is’! That’s so true! I’ve always been so consumed with ‘what ifs’, but I will now consciously consider my ‘what is’ whenever I am worried and feeling overwhelmed.  Thank you for sharing so many helpful strategies; for being honest and true.  I also love the pod squad - which was equally perfected by the reassurance of ‘not having anyone to invite’ also being ok!
Nuggets of brilliance Doyle’s ideas work better in the written word when someone has a chance to edit them first! Hard to follow and very American :)
Game changer What an absolute gift. It’s like they can read my mind. Thank you. For all of it. For the books, the podcast, and the music! Who knew I needed the Spice Girls again?! A million thank yous xx
Wonderful listen Love this podcast, it's like listening to the sisters you wish you had. Although I cry each time Tish's song plays at the end - it's so beautiful and poignant x
I love my weekly pod squad Hi Girls, I love this podcast. I live in Northern Ireland but am from Canada. Every week I tune-in here and my sissy tunes-in in Canada and then we talk. We didn’t need this podcast to have our relationship but it’s amazing to actually DO something together each week with intention. We love it! The topicals are always very relevant to one of us! We are both Glennon and Sister! Thank you for giving this to us! Big love x
Pitstopforbalance Love it and loved Tish’s song so beautiful.
Sensitivity is a super power Enlightening, comforting, kind listening as Glennon always provides. Amanda is a perfect addition as well.  In the first episode the part about being the calmest person in the house at the beginning of the pandemic, I completely relate, it’s like the world finally caught up with my catastrophising brain. And the comment about sunny days being a lot, like they make us expect too much of ourselves, the truest. Words I’d not vocalised until I found myself agreeing.  It’s like listening to a more eloquent version of my brain. Amazing podcast, my expectations were high and they have been exceeded 🙏
Amazing 👏 when I finished untamed I was left completely bereft I listened on audible and I find your words such a comfort and your voice relaxing and cathartic.  So to find your podcast was so great and the addition of sister is a definite bonus too you pair are so smart .  I look forward to each week when I can take half an hour to myself and listen to wise strong women . Thanks
Anon I needed something to save my life....you just did
Reality wrapped up in a big warm hug Glennon’s voice is magical through her books but the intimate connection she provides and the raw places she is prepared to open up and share within this podcast so that others can find that connection and realise that we are not alone with all the hard stuff we go through in this thing called life.  Absolute gold and my weekly must-listen! Xx
The final puzzle piece Thank you ladies for making this podcast. The episode on infidelity has rocked my entire being. Sister said something that was an epiphany for me. One minute I was cleaning, the next I was bent over clinging to a bath tub crying. You provided the key I have needed for moving forward. The missing puzzle piece that kept me from letting go. I feel unlocked all of a sudden. I will be eternally grateful for this. Keep making more episodes please.
Always love Glennon I love the honesty. Your relationship with your sister is similar to mine with my sister - and everyone says you look just like my mum! You do remind me of her. Thank you Glennon for making my days brighter :) and my heart braver (I LOVED untamed and bought it for every friend I could)
It just listen but embody what is spoken here Loved this episode! A great episode to listen and listen again because if you are new to this topic it will be easy to get back into old habits. Wonderful to have both sisters here as well to provide different perspectives!
Compelling and honest I don’t know how Glennon understands and tells stories that reflect my own life and no doubt countless others but she does!   I find it remarkable that the hard things she talks about are so universal that a woman of colour, of Muslim heritage, living in London and someone who, at first glance has nothing in common with Glennon, finds her words resonate deeply. This really is a very special podcast.
Thank you for doing this! Its a cliche but untamed changed my life and I’m so happy (& grateful) to hear more of Glennon (& sister’s) wise words. I nod and say ‘yes me too!’ all the way through. This is what a I need- balm for the soul. So glad it’s here.
A must-listen! This is the podcast we all needed!
We Can Do Hard Things Absolutely super honest and vulnerable podcast. I stumbled across Untamed just before we hit lockdown in England and whilst grieving lost loved ones. This extension of the book and person is a delight and makes me feel ever more reassured in a world that is hard to be human, I’m not the only one with these thoughts and feelings and we can get through it. PS Tish is rocking the writing songs/ playing guitar- very Tayloresque 😍
A must listen! So good. The book changed so much for me and now I get to revisit and re-engage with those truths again, and gain more insight and understanding, though the podcast. Thank you.
Beautiful song! This song is incredible! Untamed has become my second bible this last year and this song embodies it exactly! So talented! 🥰🎶🙏
Exactly what I needed. Thank you for producing this glorious and heart opening podcast. I love hearing your experiences expanding on that to create tools in my own life. Untamed brought me to tears almost every page snd I just love hearing you team up with your sister to share that wisdom.
Untamed - Changed my life The book was my 2020 bible ! I recommended it to so many people, so to now have a weekly podcast, is just heaven for me ! Thank you so much - Lisa - UK
So healing I absolutely love Glennon. She helped me at the start of my healing journey, after reading her book we can do hard things. My new motto be more cheetah
Pod Squad - I’m in!! :-) Loved this so very much. Feels like a warm, comforting hug.   Love Tish’s song, which brought me to tears.  I’ll be listening to each episode and eagerly awaiting the next.   Thank you for this gift.   ❤️
Loved this Love this - a great excuse to take an hour to listen, learn and reflect. Fought back some tears a couple of times but already looking forward to the next time. Thank you.
Brilliant Loved listening to your podcast today. I especially liked the answer to the question about medication and your honest account of your recent panick attack. Thank you for this abs your amazing book Untamed xx
My soul needed this The most astonishingly restorative and soul nourishing thing you’ll ever listen to. Glennon is everything we need right now - kind, honest, supportive and just the right amount of fierce. My podsquad is already formed and I can’t wait to walk through this week by week with them and Glennon. Tish’s music is also so so beautiful 😍
Listen! Thoughtful and comforting.  Thank you
Thank You So Much So wonderful, so grounding even though it reaches so far. Such an unbelievable relief to hear, put into words, what I have struggled with my whole life. A part of me genuinely feels more at peace. I cried and it felt good. Uplifted. Reassured. A bit more at Peace and so so Grateful ❤️ Much Love & Thank You, Thank You xXx
Gratitude for Glennon Pleased and proud to be in Glennon’s pod squad
Just wonderful! Thank you Glennon. Just wonderful as always. You are such a special soul and this human family is beyond blessed to have you in it 💕And Tish’s song. I welled up with the deep, beautiful joy you feel when you hear your heart in music and words. I had been praying and meditating earlier that morning and the poetry and music of Tish’s song clicked like a Lego with where my heart had been and still is. Thank you isn’t a big enough word ❤️
Just Be It was such a relief to hear you speak about authentic experiences that are incredibly relatable in so many ways.  In having Anxiety/ADHD/HSP or any other label I’ve been given…you’ve reminded me it’s nice to simply just BE.  Looking forward to what’s ahead! Glad to be a part of the Pod Squad! ;)
So much gratitude for you Glennon This podcast came at a time when I really needed it. I am just starting to understand that I have likely suffered from anxiety my whole life but felt shame for suffering believe it or not. With Glennon’s thoughtful insight she openly discusses her experiences and, as a result, rationalises and de-mystifies the way mental illness can manifest itself.   Honest; unbridled and filled with so much love this podcast will soothe, reassure and make you laugh in equal measure.   Thank you. Xx
We’re already on a level 10!! A wonderful , wonderful podcast ! It spoke to me in a way that I have never experienced !  Thank you xx
We can do hard things.. Loved listening to your open and honest podcast.  Can’t wait hear next weeks
Just what I needed After reading glennon’s books I was left wanting more! So happy to have this to look forward to weekly - great first episode, so relatable yet inspiring 💗
Wonderful Podcast Worth every minute spent listening ! thanks Glennon and sister !
Like listening to your wisest yet messiest friend I really loved this podcast. It’s so relatable, and open and honest and vulnerable. AND there are actual tips and ideas. I wept with relief at one point when I suddenly didn’t feel so alone with these wild feelings. Thanks Glennon!
YAYYYY Your book changed my life, so I am freaking excited to listen to your podcast! Thank you for doing what you’re doing, you bless my life with your words. 🙏🏻❤️
Wonderful Glennon at her best I’m a huge glennon fan and her books have changed my life. I read love warrior years ago and more recently untamed.  Wonderful podcast and the most beautiful song at the end . X
We Can do hard things 💖 Amazing wonderful & brilliant, thank you Glennon & sister ❤️ Tish’s song is so heart felt ❤️❤️❤️
Beautifully honest The podcast I’ve been waiting for.....ThankYou X
Glennon makes hard things feel easy Wow! Thank you Glennon for bringing your beautiful, raw, honest, and vulnerable humanity to a podcast. This has been by far the highlight of the year so far, the weekly top up that us GD cheetahs didn’t know we needed ❤️ Loved meeting your sister and hearing you both together modelling the support and community that we all yearn for. Just when it couldn’t get any better, Tish’s talents showcased through her gorgeous lyrics and soul soothing voice! Please tell me that will be released as a single. Thank you for continuing to show up for us in every way, can’t wait for next weeks episode!
Guaranteed goosebumps! Brutifully brilliant! G unlocks the knowing we are all carrying, uniting the pod squad in fully experiencing life.  So many ‘ah ha’ moments.sprinkled with humour and great to finally meet Sister!  Lots of love and guidance, my new self-care staple. Thank you so much 💜
Totally amazing as always! This is a fabulous podcast & I loved every minute. Thank you to my friend who shared this & is in my podsquad! The song at the end from Tish needs to be released as I cannot stop listening to it!! Thank you Glennon & the infamous Sister!
‘Hold on to the freaking counter and breathe.’ ‘We can do hard things’ was a phrase that came to me at the exact time I needed it when reading Untamed last year, and it’s a phrase I’ve kept with me ever since that basically just helps me do life. Listening to this first podcast, it’s fills me with the same comfort, reassurance, strength and deeper knowing that Untamed allowed me to feel and access within myself. I cannot wait to listen to the rest of the episodes, and then listen over and over again. (P.s - Tish’s song sounds like it’s been sent straight from heaven)💙🙏
Finalllly!!! So glad it’s finally here!
Steve C Perfect! Thanks so much!! Xx
Best of humanity When I go to a dark place ,I think of you and I know that we will be ok with people like you and Abby in this world - you are to me ambassadors for best of humanity . T.H.A.N.K.  Y.O.U.🦋🦋
A perfect description of living with anxiety Anyone who loves someone with clinical anxiety should listen to this episode. Can’t wait to listen to more ❤️
Thank you xxxx Loved every second. Sobbed at Tish’s song. Thank you thank you xxx
Must listen Just so so so good. And Tish’s song is just 💔❤️🥰
Thank you For always talking direct to my heart!!   And Tish at the end OMG!!!
Wow! This women is pure Joy!!!   Sending love G x
Loved it! Thank you Glennon for your insight, Sister for your input and Tish for the song.  Great podcast and already looking forward to next week.
Fantastic first episode! Straight-talking, heartwarming and so very honest.
We Can Do Hard Things - First Episode I’ve been so excited since I heard about Glennon and Amanda’s podcast, and couldn’t wait for the first episode. It didn’t disappoint. As I had hoped, it’s like sitting down and connecting with a dear friend that is on the same wavelength as you. It feels like giving yourself a gift by just making the time to listen to it, to really listen to it. Give yourself that gift today.
Love love loved Just perfect ❤️
Full Body Goosebumps Amazing first episode - exactly what I needed to hear in this moment - and full body goosebumps, tears and smiles for Tish’s incredible song... can we download or buy that separately somewhere???? ❤️
Wow. So many ahh thats me moments, I cried. Thankyou
YES a Glennon podcast :) I am subscribed and ready for a dose of Glennon inspiration, to do hard things :)
She’s a Queeeeeennnn Can’t wait to listen
The gift of life is more than just birth. Dropping the fake, sharing the hard - to live lighter. These words turned a light on in my mind and heart. I can’t wait for this Glennon. Thank you for articulating what many of us knew but couldn’t put into words. Thank you for your loving concern for our lives to be as real and true and intentional as they can be.
Dreams come true! Oh wow this podcast has made my dreams come true!! I have read your books over & over so many times & they still make me stop & take a breath at the truth that leaps from your pages & your words plus still brings a tear to my eye of how many times I have allowed myself to be caged & how I’ve been controlled but now i’m breaking free & this is exactly what I needed to help because podcasts are such a help to me & this is the best discovery yet! Love you ❤️
About time! YES GLENNON!!! This is gonna be fire! Thank you thank you thank you!!! You have given me the strength to be stronger with my second chance at life after my divorce with your book and I can not wait to go on this journey with you! WE CAN DO HARD THINGS!!!!🐯❤️🐯❤️🐯❤️🐯
So excited for this! So glad this is happening as I was missing the morning meetings!
Glennon is flippin brilliant I am a massive fan of Glennon Doyle and her honest and straight talking approach. It’s a relief to me! A woman with a voice. I’m giving this podcast five stars before it’s even got going. That’s how sure I am that it’s going to be more than great. Bring it on! X
So excited for this Thank you for what I suspect will be some amazing podcasts. I’m one of the people saved by your book and will always be grateful for that. Starting out on my own after 28 years of marriage is hard, but so exciting too.
Greatest podcast ever!!! Cheetah meeting every tuesday LFG!!! 🐆🐺
A weekly Untamed for the ears! Based on the trailer alone, I can’t wait!
We can do hard things This podcast shows a deep and unquivering investment in our delving respectfully into human rights, women’s rights and what is important
We are lucky to have you This podcast and these women are a gift! Your hard work and growth is so inspiring!
Could listen all day Absolutely love Glennon, Abby and Amanda.  Their authenticity, openness and insight make every topic and program so refreshing and moving.  Best podcast available, a real gift.
Obsessed This is by far my most favourite podcast (and I subscribe to about 30). Insightful, entertaining, heart warming and thought provoking. Love love love these three!
Yes More of this sense and reality and humanity and humour. Thank you and yes, and if you’re someone wondering whether to listen to this podcast - yes, do it.  Xoxo
❤️❤️❤️ My absolute fav podcast. Thank you for all the work you do xxx
Great podcast, hope you would bring them on again Megan won the Ballon d’Or the same year she won the golden boot and golden ball… which is amazing
My lifeline Reading Untamed is what brought me to life. I was alive but indoctrinations had taken my life force. Then came along this podcast, which continues to help me breathe, and continues to be an integral part of my life force. I have struggled with mental illness since the past 4 years, and I have a lot in common with Glennon. Sister Amanda and Abby help me so much while Glennon provides me the biggest help of all, language to my experience. I will forever listen to this podcast until they stop making it which I hope is never. 500 Million Billion stars. Love you
Maybe I’m not alone. Maybe I can do hard things. This podcast is where you can find some of the courage you need to do hard things.
So brave.  Thank You 💜 Glennon you are so generous to do this. Thank you. I’ve listened twice. My sister is listening twice and now we are going to compare notes and uncover more for each other. You are all incredible. I love all three of you and this podcast. Thank you!!
Love from Ireland I appreciate so much yere humour, honesty , vulnerability and insights . Míle buíochas
Fab chats, great guests, insightful topics I only discovered this podcast a few months ago and now I’m a regular listener from Ireland. Glennon, Abby & Amanda are like your sisters, your friends, your wise aunties all rolled into one. They brighten up my day with their humour and touch my heart with their honesty  #tipperarynuala
Great Podcast. Real and fun. Love love this podacast, fun , informative, real, a incredible dose of how to do life as a human in your own way.
In love with this podcast As a psychotherapist I have just discovered this podcast and am addicted to it!!
Abby thank you As a 50year old queer woman from the bottom of my heart thank you. So much resonated. How beautifully you put it all. Much love xxx
Love this podcast! Love this podcast, I loved Glennons book and absolutely love the podcast, it’s warm and filled with love. Such an inspiring and empowering podcast. Listen to it!!!
Love love love! My favourite! Helped me so much
This podcast is one of my Life Tools I really love the conversation between the three women .. it’s thought provoking, helpful, comforting and laughs at life. I’m not in the position to afford ongoing therapy .. so this really fills that gap. Thank you 🙏
Heartbreaking as so true One of the most heartbreaking podcasts I’ve ever listened to - it actually hurt - sadly my life … thank you for making me feel seen x
Every time - I love it This is great. I am challenged. I am moved. Every episode. Thank you 👏
Menopause. What we deserve to know with Dr Jen Gunter Alleluia. At last, a detailed and thorough talk about the Specifics of Menopause.   I have been on a bumpy road for too long already, and it is multi-generational history repeating. I am delighted at last to get such specific details that could really help me make educated decisions that could help make my life less needlessly challenging. Your timing couldn’t be more perfect as I have just this week begun proceeding with my GP. Thank you for enabling me to have a greater ownership of the conversation!    Eimear, Ireland
Mind blown ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ I have just listened to the episode with Glennon, Chase and Ocean Vuong and it is quite simply one of the best hours of broadcasting I have ever had the privilege to be witness to. Bravo 🙌
Every young woman should be listening to this I absolutely love this podcast and recommend it to all my students, especially the young women. These are topics they need to hear and ideas and ideals they should listen to. Thank you 😍
Love. So grateful to have stumbled across Glennon. Listening to this podcast and reading her books etc makes me feel so seen. Incredibly relatable and inspirational material…never stop ❤️
Brilliant Obsessed with these 3, incredible thought provoking conversations x
My number 1 and sweet treat every week! This podcast is such a treat for me! I am crying, I am laughing, I giggle- listening to this talks between G and her Sis is like me talking about stuff in my life with my sis. Like there is nothing I could bring on the table that this women won’t have experienced themselves or fought with.  Hearing Glennon telling that she is still fighting with her anxieties made me cry-I am in such an awe and she is one of my heroes, the bigger sister I never had, part of my family.  I feel accepted, I feel seen and heard. It doesn’t matter that they cannot really see me or hear me- my Heart feels heard. And this is priceless! ❤️❤️❤️ We can do hard things!
Brilliant! Was (unnecessarily) concerned that given the commercial success of Untamed this podcast wouldn’t be as ‘real’ as Untamed. The first podcast was exactly as brilliant as it could have been, really looking forward to the episodes to come. Thank you Glennon
Don’t even need to hear it to know it’s AMAZ So looking forward to this🙌🙌🙌 #gamechanger
The hypocracy Condemning killing kids in Gaza and not saying a word about Israeli kids kidnapped, Israeli girls brutally gang raped and tortured to death, babies burned alive in front of their parents, all on camera! Filmed by the terrorists! Educate yourself, please before you take part in support of atrocities.
Extremely let down, abandoned, and heartbroken As a woman, I’ve loved this podcast, and have always looked forward to the safety I felt listening to the transformative conversations. Sadly, as a Jewish woman living in Israel, I’m heartbroken by Glennon’s tone deaf statement and call for a ceasefire of the Israel Hamas war that excludes a demand for the unconditional return of the hostages and Hamas’s surrender. I no longer feel safe in this community, and feel betrayed by someone I’ve looked up to and felt supported by for so long. Praying for long lasting peace
Aren’t we all sister fans? Love this podcast. These are the conversations we all wish we could have with the people we love in our lives. It’s the best!!!
Favorite people on the planet You guys feel like family. What I would do do hang with the 3 of you for an afternoon. Thank you for bringing your wise words, easiness and hilariousness every time I hit play to your podcast 🙏
Post election episode Thank you so much for this episode. It’s helped me so much to get a grip on the utter devastation….as always thank you all and your whole team for creating this space that we can check into weekly to feel safe and normal somehow.
Never thought I’d say this about a podcast but.. I literally have never missed an episode! ♥️ I patiently wait for new episodes every week. It’s my favourite podcast by far. My favourite episode so far was the one about Sister (February 2023)! I love Sister. I love all of you really. Can I request an episode? An episode about animals. Not just dogs, all animals. We need more (good) people to advocate for animals and I feel like a lot of good people listen to this podcast 🙏🏻 love you Glennon, Sister and Abby! ♥️
Such an amazing job. Thank you. Through your words I feel inspired, you make me think and you give me hope. I feel less alone in wanting a more just and equal society for the women of this planet. Again thank you, and keep up the awesome work!
Fragile or not, I shed a lot of tears. I don’t exactly know if my tears are coming from the wrong place, but I often find myself misty eyed during many of your podcasts. Is it because they are so relatable, because I feel connected to your discussions, or is it false fragility and self-pity? I’m going to examine that , but in the meantime I want to thank you for opening my brain and getting it up and running again, for the longest time it seems I wasn’t even able to think about any of the important stuff that you have brought to light so humanly.
Weekly dose of cheetahs After reading Untamed I thought it couldn’t get better. I didn’t imagine we would have been blessed with a regular weekly dose of Glennon. This podcast is a life jacket for navigating family issues, personal growth and overall living a life that is truly “ours”. Thank you G. and Sis for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us. Thank you for bringing us home.  And  also, from the bottom of my heart thank you Tish for the theme song.
Love love love I absolutely love this podcast program. I learned a lot from honest deep conversation, and also it gives me comfort and power. Thank you. Lots of love, from Japan.
Feels like home This Podcast feels like home to me. Listening to G and Sister makes me feel like having a conversation with people I love.It’s so raw and unrehearsed that makes me feel at home with them. I wish there was a way to send questions from overseas. Also I absolutely adore the song at the end which made me cry the first time I heard it. Love you G and all the people you love ❤️
Thank you! Your team revolutionises my life every week, thank you for teaching me how to be human.
Thanks Thank you very much
Berné and connection Hi girls!! I don’t really know if you’ll read all the reviews we send; but I have to tell you this episode blow my mind!!! I’m crying, my life as an adult child of an alcoholic is hard ; control is my issue and Brene just nail it !!! Gracias, I send you love ❤️ from Mexico City
It’s just the onions… Every time  I’m cooking for my kids I listen to this podcast… I love it…  And I’m not crying because of it… it’s just the onions….  I love you guys… I get to know me through you…
Best podcast EVER THIS podcast has changed and improved my life in so many levels I can’t be more grateful ❤️ and I have made it my mission to share it with people close to me who can benefit, like me, so much from these beautiful and hard conversations! I adore Glennon, Abby and Sister so much!
Amazing! I received the gift if your podcast, I don’t really know how, it was the Universe that brought me to it. I’m here balling my brains out listening to the fighting episode hearing how Abby describes that her life purpose is to love Glennon. Made me realize I have never experienced love like that and this has given me the courage I need to pursue it. Thank you for being such amazing human beings and reminding us all that life is awesome even in the worst of times, brutiful as you’ve put it. Love you all!
Gracias I absolutely loooove the podcast, so honest. Thanks for talking honestly about hard things.
Thank you I am enjoying a lot this podcast, also as I enjoyed reading your book, where can I find the song that Tish wrote? It really touch my soul.  Thanks!!
I love this podcast I love Glennon and everything she does... And this podcast is not an exception. It is a wonderful production.
My absolute favorite show I honestly dont know anymore what would I do without this show 😅 It's the one place I feel most seen, heard and understood, where I learn so much and where I just feel so safe and together with the kind of people I wish the world was full of. Love it, love all 3 of you!!❤️
Vocal fry I mostly love these podcasts, however, so often I hear vocal fry and it’s so grating to my ears that I stop listening. What’s with this vocal fry epidemic in American women? Speak in your true voices! I recall Jane Fonda relating it to a disembodiment.
Love your podcast I feel like I’m with friends when I’m listening to you, thanks so much for that!
Amanda!!! Woooow, to write a letter like that! Pure wisdom and kindness. It touched me in such a way that I immediately landed into my body, which always knows Truth when it hears it. Yes, we are always playing this game and there is no losing it! Loved this episode so much.
One of the highlights of my week So grateful for these 3 beautiful souls and their vulnerability, courage, silliness, and sense of humor. The guests they have on are INCREDIBLE and I see the effort they make to feature folks from a diverse range of backgrounds. I’ve learned so much!!! For any haters or hesitant people out there- you don’t have to love every single episode to consider this a consistently educational, inspiring, and entertaining podcast. If your values align with those of these women and their community, give several episodes a try and you will find one you like!
A weekly must I listen to this podcast religiously, they have almost become my family in a sense. Secretly my biggest dream is just to hang with these three beautiful persons, drinking tea and  pondering life’s mysteries and how to most effectively navigate all of it. Sure, sometimes there is an episode that speaks less to me at that point in time, but all in all I am always sad when an episode ends. Many episodes I listen to more than once. I hope this podcast stays around for a looooong time!
Don’t know how I got on without it. I started listening after going through a breakup, and it’s become my favorite podcast. I love these people. I look forward to listening every week!
Absolute favorite podcast! These women are just increadible. So wise and funny. They make me laugh, cry and feel less alone ❤️
My fav These ladies make my day over and over again. So grateful to have sisters like this to feel less alone on the path out there. Keep up the delicious work👍🏼
Thanks for being brave This is a very real, brave and vulnerable podcast that offers safety and growth and a whole lot of love. This pod and Glennon’s book Untamed have been so inspiring to me. Still have to read Abby’s book. This pod contains some valuable life lessons and I will continue to follow.
Such a brave women and so real! I enjoy this podcast so much. Such a brave, smart and honest women. Real leaders in being themselves bravely and speak out. Thanks for being so honest. It helps me to be bravely honest.
Doing hard things just became easier I love this podcast so much. One minute it makes me laugh out loud and 5 minutes later it can move me to tears. Doing hard things is a lot easier with these women having your back. An absolute joy.
Every week I’m looking forward to listening to the podcast! I love listening to Glennon, Abby and Sister; I love their dynamic. While each of them offers a unique point of view, together they reinforce each other. This podcast talks about important, interesting topics without (always) feeling heavy. They have honest conversations with empowering guests. I’ve learned a lot listening to them. It's serious and hilarious at the same time.
Thank you! I love your podcast - I love the connection between all of you, Glennon, Amanda and Abby. For me, the balance you bring each episode between feelings, rationality and a healthy dose of reality feels right.
Thank you! Thank you so much Glennon, Abby and Amanda! I listen to your podcasts almost every day going home from work. I work with troubled teenagers who can not live at home and everything about trying to be human comes by for them and me everyday. The podcasts help me unwind and smile about being human. You remind me again and again that I don’t have to be superwoman and help me embrace being me.
Thank you Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda.  This is such a wonderfull, funny, brutally honest and truly healing podcast.  Thank you. ❤️Karina
My sisters I just love this podcast and Glennons books so much! You speak my truth! Sending you all the best, from far away in the Netherlands (Europe).
The Silent Sex Queen This was a fabulous episode! Thank you for being so real and sharing. I have shared with my husband and hoping for some real conversations with him on the topic. Thank you! We CAN do hard things. Love,  Tanja listening from the Netherlands
New fav podcast for sure! Glennon does not disappoint. Deep and wide and wise and gentle! So excited to hear more and that song at the end of episode 1 had me all teary eyed. You go Tish!
Boy, I wish I’d had you all in 2016 I just wanted to say that your family meeting after the 2024 election was so spot on, it was unbelievable. It was cathartic and validating and community spirited and angry and perfect. Just perfect. I love you all so much. Amanda, I’m taking your spirit into my community. Glennon, I'm taking your boundaries into my home. Abby, I’m taking your strength and fury into the world. One million respectful hugs to each of you, and the whole team who puts this together.
THANK YOU Feeling broken, lost, angry, sick,sad and discourage after the election results. I needed this conversation today. I felt everything that the three of you shared. I had to remind myself that others have been through worse and survived. You have given me hope, strength and belief. Thank you for all your wisdom, honestly and advice  Together we will continue to rise. We matter, woman matter, all races matter, I matter. I am with Abby and need some more time to grieve, walk in nature, sit in the stillness and reassess who I share my precious time with. This will help me refocus and build my new community and help make a difference that truely matters  THANK YOU 💕🙏
Badass women having badass conversations I love this podcast! It’s like sitting around with my girlfriends talking about the big stuff…but with slightly cooler and more accomplished badass friends :)! . love how easy and natural you all are, vulnerable and funny, and the strange and wonderful topics you chose. I’m often out landscaping with you all in my ears :) makes us realise that all our own weird quirks and things we all worry about, are all really normal, or that I’m just as weird and kooky as you all 😂 Thanks so much for hosting such fab guests and keeping my ears full of great conversations, my fave is always Elizabeth Gilbert!! Keep sharing your magic  Thanks from me, downunder in New Zealand  Sonia
Love this podcast! This podcast is one of my absolute favourite “go to’s,” every week because of the way the team bring such authentic, honest & helpful conversations that both encourage me & challenge me in profound & practical forms!
The only podcast you need I love this so much! Beautiful conversations with so many amazing people. Abby, Amanda and Glennon are delightful together. Every episode stretches and softens me a little. Absolutely love.
World Changing Every episode shifts the world a little bit. I love the courage, trailblazing and authenticity  evident in each episode.
My Absolute Favourite Podcast! Love love love this podcast! Thoroughly recommend it to all. This is life changing conversation. Thank you so much. Love all three of you!
Huge fan Love having a chuckle with you ladies as I walk in the hills. Thanks for the great advice xo
I always learn something I take something meaningful from every episode.
I adore this podcast! I’m beyond grateful to have found this podcast at a time in my life when I needed it most; navigating new motherhood and  figuring out who I truely am and how to be my authentic self. Highly Recommend!!
My favourite podcast to grace the podverse I have been listening to this podcast since it’s very first episode. Over the last two years these three incredible people and the conversations they so openly dive into, have provided a strong sense of connection, wisdom, care and joy into my listening world. I go on a walk alongside the lake I live by nearly everyday to listen to the newest episode. Thank you for all of the guests you bring onto this show, for your honesty and vulnerability, and for the joy and humour you bring to each episode. Delightful.
Wonderful, wise and witty. Give it a listen, you won’t regret it.
Gym grins & giggles This is my go-to podcast when I’m working out at the gym (& getting weird looks as I laugh at the funny bits - which is often) & when my hands are busy but my mind needs a break. I love your honesty & the huge range of people you talk to always keeps it interesting. Thanks so much for all your hard work on this podcast, team. 🙌
Thank you for changing my life for the better I love all of you and the amazing guests on this podcast. The level of vulnerability and truth is mind-blowing. I have never cried so much and so often , or laughed so hard (even though this is not a typical comedic podcast) while listening to any podcast but this one. I often think to myself “why am I even here if only to suffer?” You guys constantly remind me that life is hard, and we can do this. Thank you for being truthful, honest, and non-judgmental. You are three supportive friends in my life who I might never meet in person, but already lives in my heart. Thank you for being you and doing what you do. I inspire to be like you : )
Best podcast I love this show so much. It feels like listening in on a conversation with really smart and thoughtful friends. Thanks for being so open about your lives and sharing it with us ❤️
We can do hard things - the best vent sessions and life tips Thank you for your banter, wisdom and constant efforts to provide meaningful conversations - not just with each other - but with helpful people. I look forward to your episodes each week and always walk away with something small that I can implement in my life - to make living easier. Love you all - from a young primary teacher in NZ.  P.S loved your episode with Michelle Obama
Love this it feeds my soul This show gets to the heart of our collective and individual trauma in a transformative way. It’s heart breaking and healing at the same time. Truly brave and tender. Thank you 💕
Love it Uplifting, inspiring, funny, wonderful, real
Where’s the ‘select ALL’ button? Oh wow, this podcast is amazing! Every week I think “well that episode was my favourite so far! It can’t get any better than that!”  And then it does, again and again.  I want to share my favourite episode with my friends but I can’t choose which one and I can’t find the ‘select ALL’ button.
Thank you What an absolute honour to hear Gloria speak. Fab questions, fab pace and humour.  Thank you for bringing these incredible women to me.
Intelligent, thought provoking conversation I love WCDHT. I tune in to every episode and often share and relisten to the ones I found really impacting. Glennon, Amanda (sister) and Abby - you are wonderful! ❤️
Just the best ❤️❤️❤️
My solace Where I come to settle my mind, challenge my thinking and to warm my heart.
Love love love Love all the episodes but the friendship episodes were 🙌
Amazing! Love listening to Glennon, sister and Abby. I discovered Glennon after reading Untamed and wow, I get to listen to her each week delving into important topics and it is sooo good! Love the soundtrack by Tish :) highly recommend this podcast
We CAN do hard things Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda you have such an amazing inspiring podcast. I am so happy you are all part of my growing. Thank you.
Love This Podcast Love Love Love this podcast and you super wahine ❣️Your talks make me smile, laugh out loud, cry, fist pump and most importantly make me feel empowered. Thank you xoxo   Ps Wahine means ‘Women’ in the Māori language. Just incase ya wandering. 😉😘
Life changing, life saving 🙏🏽 I don’t know where I’d be without this podcast! Thank you from the bottom of my heart ❤️
Well done Guys I am loving this. Glennon, Abby and Sister (and Craig I guess 😏) are phenomenal. They are a living example of how co-parenting can work if everyone is invested. What an awesome team you guys are. And Tish. Tishes song is on replay. I screwed up my playlist so I have Tish, Brandi, Tish, Brandi, Tish, Brandi singing a grand total of 2 songs!! Love your work Guys xx
Connection and community Beautiful, raw and most importantly real. Thank you for normalising the hard things we all think and feel you ladies heal my heart each week.
A great guidebook on how to life life authentically! Love this podcast - I feel like I am chatting to a great friend who can articulate the hard things I feel and think but can't put words to!
Podcast topic please! Hi lovelies! Your podcast is amazing and I know you have a huge following so I wanted to ask if you will cover a topic that is really in the publics best interest? Emotional abuse. We are all relatively familiar with what physical abuse is, but there is a reason why emotional abuse is often called covert - it’s barely visible to the naked eye so goes undetected, even to the victim, but has devastating effects on peoples lives.  Some governments have begun introducing laws surrounding emotional/psychological abuse, like coercive control, because it’s real, and it’s a real vicious thing to live through, if you survive. The only way we can eradicate this violence is by bringing it into the light - talking both heals survivors and educates others so they can actually be of support rather than further traumatizing the survivor.  There are some great experts on this topic who you could interview: Dr Ramani, Annette Oltmans and Kerry MacAvoy. Please use your huge platform to highlight this topic, you could help so many. Ngā mihi (love your work)
Awesome fun , enjoying  the new learnings . Loving the new connection and new learnings. So many funny moments that warm my soul.  Great quotes and takeaway moments all in one podcast .  So grateful for all that you are sharing.    Leeann , from the bottom of the world.  Christchurch,  New Zealand
Life with honesty and curiosity I love listening to this podcast, each presenter brings a different view, they have interesting guests on and tackle a range of issues in an insightful way. Their honesty is so refreshing, I have had my eyes opened to new things, felt seen in the issues I face, found compassion, empathy and bravery there. Thank you for this awesome podcast, I love it and it is helping me through.
A beautiful gift! To Glennon, Elizabeth, Amanda and Abbie Thank you for a beautiful confronting episode.  Your books changed my perspective in life; this conversation filled me with the impetus to believe and support myself and those around me who do hard things!  I love the “drunk in love” comments, Elizabeth reflection’s on addiction and the “vampire” metaphor.   I am looking forward to the new episodes and more music.  Grateful for all your work!  Namaste,  Clara
Raw, authentic, relatable To be part of conversations inviting us into your family, your heart and your most vulnerable being is truely an honour and a blessing. So incredibly grateful for your authenticity, honesty, vulnerability and willingness to share that which is different, expanding our view of what is possible. Sending love and gratitude xx
Life changing Have listened to two episodes and had two amazing insights ! 1. Why as a sensitive person I struggle with boundaries (ie too many boundaries in place) and 2. When my ex partner said I would never be ‘satisfied’.. it actually meant I would never be satisfied with him Love, love, love ❤️
So much great content I love this show. I came here after reading Glennon's book Untamed and have found that it is such a fantastic way to keep being reminded to Be True to Yourself. I have so much to learn and retrain.
Thank you for making the difference in so many people’s libes Hi Glennon, Abby and Amanda. I just wanted to say how much I enjoy all you guys do. And Abby, you feel like an Angel on this Earth. Every time you talk, it is the most beautiful melody I’ve ever heard. When Glennon describes the first time she looked into your eyes, I can feel every single bit of these feelings. You all guys are amazing. Just to clarify, I am not gay, so no threat to Glennon lol. Thank you again so much for your work! Lots of love 💝 Veronika
So good!!!! Thank you G, Amanda and Abby for sharing your deep and meaningful chats with the world! Every single podcast has had an amazing nugget of wisdom that has instantly helped my life with a shift in perspective or giving me the language for what I already know 💓 thanks soo much, Hayley Finlay
Thankyou Hey ya Just want to say thank you to all 3 of you. I’ve laughed cried and imagined and so many more emotions listening to the REAL YOU! It’s so much easier to believe and trust when you are hearing how it really is, from the real you.  Goodluck in LA Thank you from New Zealand Kia kaha (in our Maori native tongue) stay strong
Life changing Glennon I’m so grateful to you for starting this podcast! I learn and grow every time I listen to an episode. The way you unpack conditioning and our thought processes is so helpful. Thank you thank you thank you 🙏🏼
This podcast fills me up I binged this podcast during lockdown. It wasn’t an easy button binge (listen to the self care episode, this isn’t a judgment on bingeing of any kind from me or G). It was the best kind of reset. It brings me so much joy, so many feelings, and so much hope.  Thank you Glennon, thank you Sister, thank you Abby for your authenticity, your courage and your love. I’m telling everyone!
Gets you thinking! Loving this podcast. My favourite has been on gender roles and being able to identify with another couple who face these same troubles is refreshing! Thank you
Genuine, honest, funny My three most important traits in a person are that they are genuine, they are honest, and they can be funny. And that’s exactly what I get out of this podcast. Plus I feel that Glennon and Sister are my people. Love it, thank you Melton sistaz. Also, Tish, your song is beautiful and perfect.
Thank you! This is wonderful thank you so much for putting yourself out there, to you and sister and precious Tish. Also love the term pod squad #podsquad make it a thing! Much love.
Aaaaaaah Amazing. Loved Untamed. Love the podcast. Speaking from the soul, to the soul. And Tish’s song at the end, WOW....... You are a weekly dose of holistic medicine!
So many aha moments!!! Love listening to you both talk. You listen and react and laugh and I’m just over here missing my sister. Love hearing your thoughts on anything and everything! Love always from a fan girl who has loved you from your first book till your last. Thanks for everything Glennon.  PS - Tish is a wonderful singer/songwriter. Where do I download her song?
We can do hard things... Thank you Glennon & Amanda. So nice to listen to kindred spirits talk about anxiety and depression from a space of understanding and non judgment.
Wonderful Just listen
The episode about OCD The episode about OCD…. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
The best Wise and funny. Human and loving. Reminds me how I want to be. And who I am. And that those two are really not that far apart. Luckily. Thank you.
Life changing I absolutely love the podcast. So many wonderful conversations ❤️🙏🏻
Love ❤️ Just love this podcast. Just so raw and authentic a friend keeping me company during my walks.   Love from Norway 🇳🇴
I believe you Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the episode that wasn’t.  Every working environment should be like yours! So tired of  healthy boundaries/standards being considered «over sensitive». Thank you for your important work.
What an honor to listen in to this honest conversation Wow, so much vulnerability, wisdom and honesty. I really feel that I as a listener get to be a part of this important conversations. I admire the willingness to go so deep and share so much. It makes a difference in my life and I’m sure for so many others. Thank you for your beautiful work and bravery.
Wisdom This is like having the greatest deepest conversations with your true dear friends and brings so much to my life and my reflexions.
Thank you For being brave, nuanced and real about life and it’s ups and downs ♥️
Recommend Smart, witty and thought-provoking. Love every minute of this podcast.
inspiring and joyful Hearing this podcast is like talking with friends, the topics are just fresh, original, and take you out of the box or mainstream ideas.  Love the team and love hearing you guys!
Love it ! I really loved your book and enjoy listening to what you have to say it’s very soothing to me I’m not alone!!! Thank you for sharing all that and making me feel accompanied everything you say resonates with me. Lots of love ! Veronica from Panama!!!
On how to lose half of your guilt! Hello! It was a very interesting episode! Nevertheless I was triggered by some of the examples used to explain certain situations. For example, I’ll be the sister who would try make my sister feel bad for never being with us on Christmas or birthdays, I feel like she’s always running away from the intimate family meetings, and leaving me alone with the chaos.. So yeah, i feel abandoned and I try to make her feel very guilty for leaving me alone.. But as I listened to the podcast I could see also that she really doesn’t care about how I feel so she goes ahead with her plans, and I need to work on my issues 😬 cause making her feel guilty doesn’t fix how abused I feel about having to take care of my family by myself..ahhh hard work to be done..💔💔  Also I could see that the examples with mom and kid dynamics are really innocent and of course there’s no need to feel guilt about a mom making her life in parallel to raising her child 🙏🏼 But what happens when somebody really goes against their own values and feel a huge real guilt. How to overcome having betrayed yourself and others?  Also, you use words as “others expectations” instead of “others values” and what happens when you crash with others real values. Not in a dynamic where they just can make an external opinion, or a cultural judgement but when you really collide with other person that has different but valid values. Not just free judgers.  Omg I expanded! But this are the things that arose in me during the podcast.  Thank you for putting the things over the table!
Loved Loved your first episode! You made me realize more about anxious people. My mom is an anxious person and have dealt all her life and finally I can understand more of his way of seeing normal or daily things. Can’t not thank you enough!! And by the way your daughter’s songs is BEAUTIFUL! ♥️
From Peru Listening from Peru. Loved your three books and loving your Podcast. 👏👏👏 Beautiful song from your daughter!
Fab Abby The Abby Wambach episode, Will I Ever Be Truly Loved, was comforting and validating. What she said about understanding that her mom loved her the best way she knew how, was exactly how i reconciled and healed from the pain of growing up gay in a relatively conservative family. All the best to gay people like us confronting and reconciling with the pain of our past.
Impactful Honest and straightforward discussions that deal with the hardship around self-improvement, relationships and business.
My favorite human being I’ve always admired how Glennon lives her life and how brave of a woman she is. This podcast reminds me every time how she does good for so many people genuinely from the heart without the expectations of something in return and I think that really is how pure this woman is. Your existence itself is already more than enough to help millions of people.
I love this podcast! I can feel it’s changing our society by making it more open and inclusive.
The best podcast ever This podcast is a real life saver. I couldn’t be more grateful. Thank you!
Amazing This podcast makes you reach your true wounded self and give her a big hug and comfort her together with your Higher Power
Nourishing Love the soul sustenance that you bring into my life with every episode. Thank you
Never to be missed. I never missed a single episode because every one of them is the place to were I like to be mentally and emotionally transported. Your podcast is thoughtful, heartfelt, warmth and loving. A perfect place to go every Tuesday and Thursday. Thank you to the three of you ❤️!
I’m hooked I’m loving it, I’m quite new to the Glenon world but love hearing your take on things... I can’t stop listening to the song, I just love it, I get chills and almost cry every time I listen to it but it doesn’t stop me to listen to it again and again... thanks for alllllll you are giving us!!!
The best podcast! Thank you so much for this podcast, the three of you are awsome!
Thank you so much! So grateful for this podcast , didn’t skip a second of it.
Must listen for everyone Best podcast hands down!!! Never miss an episode.
Remarkable I find the level I of specificity with which Glennon, Abby, and  Amanda speak remarkable. It is a gift, like being given a special set of binoculars that allows you to see some of our deepest human battles and insights, but in a lighthearted way. Listening to the shows feels like having someone articulate something you’ve felt for a long time but were never able to put into words.
Humaning together G, Abby and Amanda, firstly, I love you all so much! I’ve started listening to your podcast a while ago from Episode 1 and am working my way up (I don’t want to miss one episode!). Thank you for showing up just as you are: beautiful, human & messy. And sharing that with the world. You guys are my fav. Love from South Africa.
My favourite podcast ever The best podcast I have listened to hands down. I have listened to every single one and can't wait for Tuesdays and Thursdays to get the next one. I feel like Glennon, Abby and Amanda are my friends, getting together to chat and laugh and cry. Just. The. Best. Love love love from South Africa.
Thank you ! I’m a newbie to your podcast and have now recommended you guys far and wide. Your topics are always so well chosen and broadcasted just when I need them. Thank you Glennon, Abby and Amanda for your sensitivity, life insights, and just the best sense of humour. Know that I so look forward to your podcasts each week. Nicola
We can definitely do hard things! I did a hard thing! I found the rate and review button for this pod! It was hard, but I am glad I slogged it out and did it, because I genuinely love this podcast. Thank you for a great show Glennon, Abby and Sister ♥️
The voices in our heads I listen to all your shows, every single one, twice a week (and Tuesdays sometime come a little too slowly) and I share them often … sometimes (actually who am I kidding, often!) I feel like you’ve climbed in my head and taken the lose words, made sense of them and put them back in my head! Of course more jumbled words show up but that’s ok because we can do, and do do, hard things! Thank you. For it all. I love you, bye.
LOVE LOVE LOVE O my, only started listening to these podcasts yesterday. And cannot stop! Thank you ladies for enlightening us with your incredible topics. Can’t wait follow this journey
They have the words for my feelings Glennon, Abbey and Sister have created the most amazing space and invited us in. Every week I find myself somehow learning about the world and myself in equal measure. They have the words for my human experience better than I have them myself. Thank you to all of you for lighting the way.
Wonderful Podcast Excellent podcast I'm so glad I started listening. To hear that other people in different parts of this wide world are going through the same things you are is so very supportive. Life is not a rehearsal.
We can do hard things! Love your podcasts. I love the way they encourage me to think about life and situations differently. The vulnerability, care & compassion is beautiful. Thank you.
Beautiful humans having deeply enriching conversations The way you love each other and show up in the world is inspiring.
My favourite people I feel like Glennon, Abby, Amanda and company (usually Sarah Paulson) are the little emotions inside my brain (like Inside Out). I have grown so attached to this podcast and I feel like this is my little comfort place. I love them.
Come here This podcast is SO good. It’s like sitting down with your best friend and talking about ALL of the things. And your friend is hilarious, wise, insightful, and riddled with the same eccentricities and weirdness as you. Come here if you need to take a breath. Come here if you need a soft place to fall. Come here if you want raw, honest conversations with the best authors, musicians, politicians and poets. Every week you’ll leave a little lighter, remembering that we are all in of the messy-middle of something, in this wild brutiful life, and that’s perfectly okay.
Episode 47 with Irene brown doesn’t play Hi there,  Any idea why I can’t play the episode with Brene Brown? Would so love to listen.  Thank you so much for the most extraordinary podcast I absolutely LOVE it and am learning so much!  So much love   xxxxxxxxx
Thank you I listened to the podcast because I am a self proclaimed “hard things” person.  It gave me a great twist and reminded me of my commitment to “not take myself so seriously”  You are my new happy place 🌞
MY embarrassing/hysterical moment ! OMG.. listening to episode 116 today on most embarrassing moments had me crying with laughter on the London Underground and walking down the street . I had to stop walking as I was cry laughing so hard. It was worth being stared at and judged as a crazy lady.. Thanks for making my day !
Modern Wisdom I am loving this show and finding growth & healing with every episode. I think it is so important that this wisdom comes from women, modern women with modern problems living everyday lives as  creators, lovers, mothers, friends, sisters, entrepreneurs. Please don’t forget that many of your listeners live outside of America  :)  Thank you  Diane Cape Town  South Africa
You’ve made me want to live again I heard about your book because my daughter bought it. I’m going to buy one too. I listened to your first episode on anxiety and I’ve had such a huge awakening and listening to what was said is going to save my life. I’ve been suicidal and you’ve made an incredible impact on me and understanding anxiety. I thank you deeply with all my heart, all the way from South Africa. I absolutely love your daughters song too ❤️ *edited*  I’m so confused by You and “sister” sounding exactly the same and makes the podcast hard to follow 😕
One of the best podcasts around. I love everything about this podcast. I’m a longtime fan of Glennon Doyle and a new fan of both Abby and Amanda. Their chats are priceless, deep and full of great advice. You never feel like an outsider- more like friends chatting around a table (although I suspect Glennon won’t be a fan of that) Amanda brings incredible wisdom and her comments are always well researched and very insightful. I love when Abby joins the conversation and brings another perspective. I haven’t missed an episode yet.
Love it I really love this podcast. I love Amanda and what she brings to the show, but please can she stop shouting into the mic. Or not, I guess one thing you teach is to do you. So perhaps I should rephrase: I sometimes feel like Amanda is reprimanding me when she talks. I reiterate: love the show, love Glennon, Amanda and Abby. Sorry!
Life changing Untamed was offered to me from an unlikely source… a young woman in her final year of high school (I’m 62 and a half) whom I’d very rarely interacted with… she read me so well. Your story, IG posts and podcasts have turned my life around. I’m inspired, I laugh, I get goosies and I get a tear in my eye. If I knew how to thank you all more, I would.
The mom, sister, friend,teacher I never had Glennon on fills so many roles for me in her wisdom on so many issues. I love how real she is and she tacklers each topic with grace. If you haven’t read untamed please do yourself a favor, it is life changing, and so well written, funny with so much to relate to.
Thank you for your vulnerability Living in a world where I constantly feel judged and not good enough, this podcast makes me feel I’m ok. There are other people out there like me and it’s ok to feel and be like this. I am good enough and this can also be normal. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability.
Healing It feels just like Untamed did. Raw, honest, deep and meaningful. Glennon feels deeply and so can describe everything I feel at the surface, or at least I think it’s at the surface. And it invites me to explore myself, in my own time. Thank you for this generosity, Glennon. And thank you Tish for the song I didn’t know I needed.
So grateful These episodes are arriving in a moment in my life that is saving me from myself. Thank you for being so brave and speak about hard things. With my heart ❤️
Always with you I started reading your books back in 2019, I bought them all. I connected in such deep level. I’ve been following your posdcast since day 1. You’ve been with me throughout this period, when I was living in London, then moved New Zealand and now Spain and the world. So much has happened in my life that I couldn’t have found the corage to move on and stay strong without you. Thank you to all three of you. I’ll always be with you.
Just listened to Laura Mc Allen So good hearing real open honest talk   Love you all 💗
Abby’s episode Not boring. So human. Your podcast warms my heart ladies. 🤗
Tuesdays and Thursday’s are the best days of the week. These women are prophets. The insight, empathy, grit, and wisdom that come from Glennon, Sister, and Abby is changing the way I walk through life. Thank you, girls. Keep making good trouble.
Amazing I love these conversations and topics. So many perspectives here! Each week is a new learning process. What a way to process all the feelings and be held at the same time. Thank you for this gift at such a difficult time in the world ❤️
This is so, so good! This podcast has taught me so much! It’s amazing.
Soul healing This type of conversations are our natural medicine, they are the space our souls need for healing from life’s hard lessons. Thank you, Glennon and Amanda, for celebrating our humanity, for sharing your gift, for being bravely you.
Yay!!! I loved this first episode!!! This is great. Going to share right now!!!
Sweden is listening Or at least I am! Thanks for being so… you? Times three! I listen to all episodes and especially love the ones where it’s just the three of you talking.   We Can Do Hard Things is the ONLY podcast I follow since I’m carefull with what I consume, dont have any social media and well, am a picky-listener.  Thanks for your perspectives!
I love to listen and reflect with you You make me feel like we are friends, doing life together. Thank you ❤️
Thank you! For creating a real existing place and space where it is easier to breathe and where thougts and feelings related to being human are aknowledged and respected and discussed. Thank you so, so much!
Its like medicine I love this podcast, its been life giving to me
Bestest Podcast ever❤️ This is the best podcast in the entire universe !!!  ( sharing goldmedal only with Brené Brown Unlocking Us🙏🏻). It is hilarious, deep, thoughtful, vulnerable, warm, beautiful all at once!!! Your best spent time ever!
Hard things for sure, but not hard to listen to- love this! I absolutely love this podcast! They are so true, so genuine and every topic interesting. Can recommend the ones on parenting a little extra, and the sex talks. Sister and Glennon (and Abby when she is on) feel like friends. I shared some episodes with my husband and he likes them too…
Thank you Thank you Glennon and Abby, but most of all thank you Sister for talking about the issue about living as a woman in a heterosexual relationship where the woman is the one being turned down. I’ve never heard anyone talked about this before and I’m so relieved that I’m not alone and sad about my own situation and thankful for you talking about this. I’ve been so ashamed about this for so long. So thank you for letting me know I’m not alone ♥️
Go tell it! Say as it IS, not how it is ”should” to be...or how others expect it to be. Love to join in this poddsquad from Sweden!❤️🙏🥳 @brittasvardagsrum 🎧
Thank you! Beautiful. 🙏🏻💗
Thanks from Sweden! I love Love Warrior, Untamed and now - the pod! I want to have podsisters to share my thoughts with, my weird worries and persistency in not always accepting life as it is. Much love to G and sister 💜
We Can Do Hard Things and Tricia Hersey To save my life, I couldn’t say anything in a review of this podcast that would be as good as this episode. Go listen. Right this minute. That’s all you need to know. It could save your life.
FAVORITE This is THE best podcast. Thank you for all your vulnerable and honest conversations. I have been moved to tears on many occasions. What a gift.
The Best This is just THE BEST podcast!!! So many good topics and invited guests on, in addition to the learnings. WoW!  I just finished listening to the two enneagram episodes with Suzanne Stabile and its amazing!  Keep going, we need you 3!!!
Great stuff - Nice dynamic between the hosts, interesting content, and a perspective that is often new to me (including as I’m a dude …);  thanks !
Heals my heart and fills me with hope Each episode cracks me open, soothes me and reminds me that I am not lone on this brutiful walk through life in a body, in a place that constantly tells me and my kids to make ourselves smaller.  Just finished listening to Dr Hillary McBride and am sitting in tears, feeling all the things in my body and knowing the deep relief of understanding myself a little more thanks to feeling understood. All other podcasts could stop tomorrow, but I’d keep a small handful. We Can Do Hard Things would be at the top of the list of keepers. Thanks Glennon, Amanda and Abby. You make all the difference in the world.
One of the best out there I’ve listened to every single episode of this podcast. These 3 women are just so incredibly articulate, intelligent and inspiring. They cover so many topics from parental struggles to political issues to art as expression of self to menopause. I’ve laughed and cried so many times I’ve lost count. An absolute must-listen. They will change your world.
The HG podcast This podcast is like a friend that gives you the best hugs. Don’t ever stop making it! Thank you so much!
These conversations give me hope every week Profound topics, looked at from a deeply sensitive vantage point. Glennon, Abby and Amanda touch my heart every time. Thank you for sharing your light & experiences with the world.
My absolute favorite podcast This podcast is so important. It is re-wiring my brain. Thank you so much Glennon, Amanda, and Abby!
My holy island Whenever I listen to this podcast, I feel seen, understood, loved, and I can really feel that I am not alone. Even if women in my actual environment do not appear to have the same struggles as I do - maybe because it’s Switzerland ;-) - I now know that somewhere on this planet there is my tribe. I am proud to be part of this pod squad. Love from Karin
I LOVE this podcast!!! I am beyond thankful for Glennon, Amanda and Abby doing this podcast. It‘s helpful, inspiring and makes my world a little brighter and my horizon wider.
Inspired I love this podcast!!
Love it! Super surprised by how much I love this podcast. I love the conversation, the insights, the sharing and the complete honesty. You both are very relatable. This will be my weekend fun thing to do: listen to the all of the episodes
Thank you for being so REAL While listening to you two, I found myself commenting, nodding my head, laughing, crying... It was as if I was sitting with you and finally had found a couple of soul sisters. So thank you for helping me realize that I am not alone in feeling the way I do. Love / Reb.
Every word resonates with me I have heard two podcasts so far and I’m hooked. It’s as if I hear my innermost thoughts being spoken out loud and I find myself nodding or even saying yes loudly when I driving and listening to the podcasts.  I loved Amanda’s lightening love vs summer rain love analogy and experience. It’s so me and my experience so thank you for bringing this to the table ❤️
A must-hear I wake up every day listening to this podcast while having my breakfast because this podcast brings joy and understanding to my every morning. I carry this sensation with me throughout the day and can’t wait to go to bed to wake up listening to an episode again in the morning that brings me back to that special place— a place where I belong to and a community that will welcome all of us with open arms🤍
Essential This podcast helps me feel deeply understood and gives me relief and connection 🙏💜
Tia Levings Woah, I’m reading Tia Levings’ book right now! It is…rough. Can’t wait to listen to her on the podcast.
All the Feels I love this podcast because as a mom, boss, friend, partner, it is a respite from the hard things in my world. I love learning and hearing the stories. Fav episode: Task Ticker - every PARENT should listen. 💗
Exceptional podcast! I keep learning so much about myself with this podcast! They explain SO much about what all of my unexplained issues have been. I am learning to be free! I am a goddam cougar! AND the door isn’t even locked! Hallelujah! Thank you Glennon, Abby and “Sister” (I don’t hear her name enough to remember her name!) 🥴
One of the best episodes This one really hit home for me. Thanks for putting words on so many feelings and helping me understand how I got to where I ‘was’ but no longer am!!!
Eps. 369 Trad Wife Cults Just listened to this part 1 episode and it made me so sad and frustrated.   It also gave me hope because there is a way out. I was one of these women in one of these fundamental Christian groups who call themselves Baptists.  What they really are is a group of controllers posing as “God’s workers”. Thank you for putting these words into the universe for all women to hear!  If this can save just one it is so worth it.
Trickster energy episode! Tricia Hersey is my new favorite person!  Thank you for introducing me to her and her beautiful and enlightening way of living. Resting is a hard thing and she gives you the brilliant reasons why it is sometimes the smartest thing to do. No more nap guilt!
Laughing through the bs… You’re talking about real issues but making me laugh. That is the best kind of therapy I need right now.
Negative Very one sided, lacking depth, victim oriented and completely out of touch.
AS I was hoping to learn more. There were some great questions which were not answered. To many would, should, could sentences.
Love the show! I love all the episodes and am especially enjoying the recent Dramatic Social Media Plan episode. I have been off social media for the past six months and I've been happier, more at peace, and felt more in control of the decisions I'm making in my life since being off of it. I totally related to the "it just felt bad" sentiment. For me it really took getting completely off of social to realize how much of a negative effect it was having on me. I felt very similar to Glennon where the stress and anxiety of being on social media throughout the day would bleed into how I experienced my life outside of social media. (But I didn't even realize this until being off of it for awhile and noticing the difference.) loved everyone's perspectives throughout the episode, like about how many people's careers/potential career opportunities can be tied to social media in different ways. Thanks for the show and looking forward to more episodes! :D
Fantastic!!! I love you G!!!!!!! This show is my favorite!!!!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
One of the Best The Melissa McCarthy episode is one of the best of this entire pod!
“You have the words of life.” I very much believe that podcasts like We Can Do Hard Things are the sacred scriptures of my new faith. I soak up each word and savor it and hold it close to my soul because some days it feels as though it is all I have. I’ve lost my faith in Christianity and it’s people but I haven’t lost my faith in faith and your podcast helps so much. I just finished listening to the November 19 episode featuring the delightful Ross Gay and it is truly well with my soul. I feel as though I have feasted on the most succulent and satisfying meal. I am so glad my baby sister Sarah introduced me to your show because it is just continuing living proof of how much she loves me. And oh how she loves you. Thank you for sending out messages of hope in fragile bottles because one of them washed up on my lonely shore and rested gently against my feet. I could but only lift it up and open it. What joy.
Episode 367 I am not sure why I am carving out time to listen to you read scripted ads and talk about your lives? Why listen to podcasts?
Life changing I can’t tell you how much your insights and thoughtful chats have meant to me. Truly life changing. From “finding delights” to navigating “the ache”… my mind drifts back to episodes daily and I am better for it. Thank you
Thank you!! I so appreciate this Podcast that talks about the real with vulnerability and humor.  It is very helpful.  I often listen to it early in the morning when I don’t have to get up yet and the perspectives are a great way to go into my day.
A gift Grateful
With gratitude! I could not be more grateful for the three of you!  You continuously share your lived wisdom, joy, frustrations, challenges and vulnerabilities with your listeners.  You are pouring out your love to help the rest of us walk this path of being human!  I have learned so much from you three and your amazing guests. You are all such beautiful souls!  From the bottom of my heart~thank you!
Delight-full You guys, I had to pause the podcast and write. Glennon's story about her interaction with the TSA agent had me laughing so hard I started crying (while trying to put on makeup!). I haven't laughed that hard in...well I just don't know. (Could have been years ago during your episode where listeners described embarrassing moments). Anyway thanks for a wonderful beginning to my Daily Delight practice!!
Thank you for the hope! You have given me so much in just a few episodes. I've laughed, cried and raised my fist in agreement. I'm finding ways through all of you to be a queer woman, a special needs mom, and finding a way out of the darkness. I started listening after the election. I'm truly grateful!  I hope to continue to learn & grow through you & setting boundaries with people. Much love to you all!
Malcom Thank you! This episode gave the hope I needed and also gave me great ideas!!!
Touching, moving, soul-connecting interviews I’d been hearing about this show, but hadn’t really dialed in until the Ross Gay episode. The discussion with him about joy simply resonated 1000%. I am a new fan. Thank you for the work you put into this podcast.
still contributing to the problem Again clueless about why people did not vote for your candidate. Glennon almost got it for a minute with her comments about dignity for all, not just minorities. And about the wacky messages the Democratic Party put out. But Amanda still self-absorbed thinking that anyone who didn’t vote with her, voted against her. Think bigger. It’s about the issues, not the personalities. It’s about bigger things than race, gender, lgbqt and abortion. Very few people voted to take away women’s rights. Did you hear all the states that voted against the ban. It’s about the Economy. The military. Taking care of u.s. citizens first. Police protection. Illegal immigration. It’s not about the wacko personalities who actually have the guts to run for president. Please help the effort to unite. Stop treating people who didn’t vote with you like they voted against you. For the majority of people it’s not true. It’s delusional.
Whoa today a day of unknowing with Mr. Gay on the podcast This episode made me grin a few times, rewind 10 times and …I took notes …sweet reminders that curiosity trumps knowing again and again… and Ross Gay’s books and his voice are delight.. but not creepy sweet delight but slow careful joy .. from a spot I seldom stand but I want to!
Sad I’ve listened to this podcast for years and while I haven’t always agreed with everything discussed,  I’ve been open to hearing their pov because I felt it was well intentioned and I’m open to learning.  With the election, I’m hearing a harshness from wealthy women who don’t seem to have an understanding that this economy with putting food on the table isn’t working for all.  I’m blown away by the disconnect.  - I work 3 jobs and Amanda has repeatedly said she doesn’t want anyone who doesn’t fit her agenda in her life.  I’m realizing wealth and fame means their hard things are no longer mine.
Thank you for community I was searching for a good podcast to listen to about the fear and horror I’ve been coping with since the election and then I stumbled upon your post election family meeting. I have been a diehard podcast listener for many years and this is the first time I’ve ever felt compelled to write a review. THANK YOU FOR COMMUNITY
Stick with them These women share their intimate, complex lives and sometimes it’s beautiful and sometimes it’s really uncomfortable. And that’s why I listen to them … each episode you see them grow and it’s kind of messy. I like how they don’t gloss things over when it comes to experiences like trauma and death. I may not agree with everything they say, but I do admire their audacious authenticity. On another note: I need more Abby. She cracks me up as much as makes me weep. What an amazing journey she’s on. Such a bright light.
It Never Fails No matter how many times I’ve thought a pod topic was “not for me”, I listen, and the trio and guests never fail to  impart  nuggets of wisdom, enlightenment and courage. Oh, and a lot of laughs too! So appreciate this podcast!
ILYSM but Rec trigger warning 363 I love y’all so much and listen regularly - started to listen to 363 but had to stop. I recommend adding a warning to that episode about suicide.
Thank you Thank you three for being such beautiful voices in this world.   I’m so grateful for this podcast.
A Source of Comfort Thank you for providing comfort in these difficult times.
Soul feeding So grateful for this podcast.  Found the family meeting after the election episode super helpful and shared it with loved ones 🤗
SECURELY ATTACHED! Glennon,   I felt this episode and this particular part in my bones!! You did it! A++++.    Not only is Chase securely attached, you are humaning in the abyss….. yes, yes. Yes!!   Thank you for another gift of an episode.   So very grateful as always!!
I laugh, I cry, I learn & I love this podcast My title says it all. Thank you Abby, Glennon & Amanda.
ILYSM I legit feel like I’m sitting IN the room with you three the entire episode. If I’m in the car listening, I’m talking as if you can hear me. This show is my absolute FAVE not to mention the topics are relatable and so on point and exactly what this world needs to shift for real change and LOVE. LOVE YOU!!!!!
I love weird Glennon! I love weird Glennon! Thank you for sharing! 💗💜💗💜 It means so much and helps so much! Lots of love to you all!
Loved the Breaking Codependency episode This was an amazing podcast that everyone should listen to. I thought I knew so much about codependency, but realized the topic is way more nuanced. Thank you for always tackling the difficult subjects.   Glennon: “where can we accept all the cookies”. Still laughing!
🙋🏾‍♀️🌈 I love this podcast, the nap ministry one was amazing! As a Black Queer, activist, writer and mom I wasn’t sure if this podcast would be for me. But I love these womyn, they are so honest, so relatable and they always have amazing guests! I often share a few episodes with friends and family. Women keep up the great work and i pray one day to join you as a guest! Check me out please  www. treyanthony.com 🙌🏾
Beautiful, wise, moving and funny It’s like I made 3 very dear friends and am having the real, deep conversations that I crave, that help us to feel less alone (I’m not the only one who feels or thinks this way!), and helps us grow and evolve together as we navigate this crazy ride called life.  Thank you, Glennon, Amanda and Abby!!  ❤️🥰
I want to sit around a campfire with these ladies I’ve been an avid listener for 2 years now, and this 25 y/o, recovering people pleasing lesbian can’t get enough. The guests are fantastic, the topics discussed are so relatable and emotionally invested, and Glennon, Abby and Amanda are mentors I wish I could meet in real life. I want to be all three of you when I grow up, even though I’m very much a grown up lol. Love you all.
Inspirational I was listening to the Handsome pod and they recommended this. Just started with the post election family meeting and it really helped me out. It gave me hope and a sense of community as we head into a very frightening political time. Thanks for reminding me that there are truly still good people out there in spite of all evidence to the contrary. Great pod starting to follow and looking forward to the next episode.
Out of touch. The red wave proved this. Why are they such advocates for abortion and “my body, my choice”, but are supportive of policies that push mandatory covid vaccines. So hypocritical. Informed consent must work both ways.
Yes, America hates women The review Blushing Now wrote is nothing but another MAGA who will get exactly what they voted for. I don’t wish ill will but they voted for the destruction of this country. YOU helped him get here, YOU voted for the end of democracy. Sit in that fact.
Therapist approved I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to review. I have listened since episode 1. I love love love this podcast. I’m a therapist and have recommended it hundreds of times at this point. These ladies are such a powerful force and they are a blessing to us all. I enjoy them thoroughly and they have changed my life personally and professionally. Everyone would benefit from listening.
Making a difference Thank you for your honesty and inspiration. I really needed to hear your words this past week.
Thank you Thank you wonderful women for the post- election day content pivot. I rely on this podcast for many things. This episode delivered exactly what I needed on this day. Abby, your rage was so raw and so visceral it tapped right into what I was also feeling. And, yes, waking up the kids on November 6 was twice as bad as waking them up with the same awful message eight years ago. It was hard, but we all did it. thank you.
Pass Your “post election meeting” episode  is so polarizing….. so full of hate, racism, and vitreal. I have no further desire to explore life with you ladies.   I have dear friends from both sides of of the aisle, I “live in community” with people that share different views than I do. I would never want to demand  such a one-sided allegiance from my dear friends.
Love you 3 Please have on Bari Alyse from Community News with Paul and Sasha podcast
Episode 361 This morning I searched my podcast feed for a little light before heading to my firm where I represent survivors of sexual violence. I feel like I’ve been “Tulsa’d, Willington’d, Emmit Till’d, Breonna’d and George Floyd’d” all over again. That feeling that white supremacy has once again brazenly leveraged a system for purpose of demoralizing and annihilating others. I’m an African American mom terrified for my sons, brother, nephew and clients. However, I am steeled by my mother, father, aunties and uncles that provide a path out of this savagery. Thank you all for showing compassion in this episode.
Thank you Lights in the darkness ✨✨✨
Follow the Stars ✨⭐️🌟 Thank you for reminding me to always look up to the stars and see the Divinity in this Universe v the madness of these times.
The People Have Spoken For 12 of the past 16 years democrats have run the country.  Grow up and check your privilege. Democrats missed the obvious in 3 elections bc they live in an echo chamber. For ppl who preach tolerance you two sisters are full of hubris.  Comical. How haughty and prideful to Characterize Trump voters as having one IQ point. Amanda has a kid with exceptional needs but she still doesn’t miss the opportunity to mock an entire group of  vulnerable ppl ( cognitively impaired).    Amanda, respectfully you may be smart but you are not wise.  You’re more determined to be right rather than doing the right thing.  Become engaged with people other than those who confirm what you already believe.  You may be surprised at how little you know . Abby remains the only one with her sh t together because her life was dedicated to team. From experience she knows feelings can lie to us. Abby continue to live in your own head rather than the sisters. What a tragedy it would be if you never met yourself. Keep doing you.  GLENNON, sometimes I am in awe of how on pointe you are. Other times I grieve that you remain emotionally stuck in a 14 year old mind. The level of hate you spew screams poor loser. Abby, explain this to them.  Sisters, you missed your calling and should be actresses. The drama level is remarkable.
Divisive If you want a direct route to see the mind virus that has captured white women in America, listen to just a few moments of this podcast.
Insane Women Listened to the post election pod and can’t believe these women are so insane. Comparing yourself to a Black person under Jim Crow. LOL. These podcasters are the luckiest, most protected people on earth. Listening to this you can understand why Trump won.
Thank you Thank you for this much needed conversation and perspective.
We are not alone 361 post election family meeting helped me so much to know how to go forward   Thank you
Delightful and Insightful I hesitate to use the phrase “life-changing” because it’s so overused, but WCDHT really has been life-changing for me. I’ve gained countless insights into my behavior and my experience of the world around me, in just one year of listening. It’s also very funny!
Thank you. Your post election podcast gave me much needed perspective and helped me process this mess. Specifically, the concept of the maga rip tide and how to get out of it is life changing. I vow to give as little to it and find community in other ways. Thank you! 💕💕
Election I’m not sure why I listened to this given your constituent progressive man hating agenda but I did. I have to say you all are super dramatic. Nothing has changed ladies . I get you want abortions all the time all day every day and in most states you can do that to your hearts content and if you can’t you can cross the state and do it or elect leaders in those states who will allow unlimited abortions or send away for some abortion pills… other than that please let me know the rights you are so worried about? Kids not be able to chop off body parts and taken hormones that irreversibly sterilize them before they are legal adults… ? You guys need to check reality. Donald trump ain’t perfect but be he is representing what most common sense people feel. You ladies are the radical ones and honestly whiny and crazy. You may not be listening to social media but maybe you should. America does not hate women, you chicks hate men
Love I have listened to every episode and love it every week! I want you to know that because of the information I have learned from you, I am one of the three percent. No turning back now. Love you all!! ❤️
Thank you. Just wanted to say a special thank you for the post-election show. As a Black woman in California who is aware that she enjoys a spectacular amount of privilege, I am horrified, saddened and disappointed in the results. The call you put out to LOVE ANYWAY is the most important message we can all carry forward. Am sending the episode to everyone in my community.
Day after the Election Family Meeting I needed to hear all of your voices after Trump was reelected. Like you, I also felt and still feel betrayed by our un-United States of America. Since the dark days of the pandemic, I have been a listener, what you share with your listeners has helped shape me as a parent and as an individual. This episode resonated with me deeply! Every emotion you expressed, I felt and still feel too. Like Glennon, I have walked away from social media before but I started back again during the campaign. I do think I need to take another break! It’s a drug that makes me feel small. Your podcast today challenged me to think about what I do next. And that it is okay to be like Abby and need a longer moment to regroup if I needed it. How do we continue on when hope feels lost? Thank you for reminding me that we will find our humanity in the small things and then we can continue to make bigger contributions like donating to Planned Parenthood and helping to fund groups that continue to work in our community. Thank you for being you! Love you Glennon, Amanda and Abby!!
Am I part of your community? I was finding your latest podcast, post election family meeting, to be so helpful. I felt comforted, included - until you mentioned Democrats funding genocide. I know what you meant by that. The US is funding Israel. Jewish women, unlike white women, voted overwhelmingly for Kamala. 88% of us voted for Kamala. And you just alienated that 88%. You threw us out of your community by claiming what is happening in Gaza is a genocide. Let me be clear - what is happening in Gaza is horrific. My heart breaks for the children and their families whose lives have been lost and destroyed by this war that HAMAS started. Israel is not perfect, the govt is not my favorite, but the only genocide that occurred in that region this past year was on October 7th in Israel. You have made me feel more alone than ever.
🙄 Started listening to latest episode and couldn’t even finish. I’m blown away by how delusional people can be. Our country doesn’t need a woman as our president. Especially one that just cares about the “rights” of a woman and all this junk. My next president (THANK GOD) Donald Trump, cares about this country and truly wants what’s best for each individual. He stands for whats right. The Bible also says “thou shalt not murder” and millions of precious innocent babies are murdered every year. Anyway, yeah. This podcast is a no for me. :)
You 3 are the Best I recently found your podcast and I look forward to each episode. Last week your message about parenting older kids was 100 spot on! Thank you! When you compared parenting to that of inviting your favorite people to a party my soul resonated with that message. Your day after the election episode was amazingly raw and accurate. Each of your messages and comments aligned with my own feelings and emotions. Thank you for stepping up and taking the time to create that episode. It was a one of the hardest days of my life. I just recently realized how much the world does in fact hate women. The truth of that fact is both devastating and enlightening. Thank you sisters for everything you do to make our world a better place. It’s so good to know I am not alone. I lived in Rochester, NY most of my adult life and now I am in RED Florida. It’s been hard to make friends, not just connections. Now I have you to brighten my days.
Thank you for sharing your selves I’m straight and single and childless and White, and you are my heroes and my role models for bravery and kindness and generosity of spirit. I feel inspired by every point you worked through in your mourning  after episode this Wednesday. While I knew already that this racist, misogynistic nation is even more misogynistic than racist, I was shocked to realize how greatly its hatred surpasses its desire for its own mythology. I am crushed. And I feel naive and ignorant. But I know that I can do hard things, too. With your words in my head and heart, I am focused on building safe spaces where actual loving community can thrive, a safe place for the scared and the anxious, the ones who need help to escape the riptide. Keep holding on to each other … and thank you for sharing with us 💖
Thank you 🙏 I can’t thank you enough for your show the day after Election Day. Your heartfelt grief, anger, sadness, etc, really resonated with me. I’m feeling crushed, confused and angry. I also loved your self care suggestions towards the end. Super helpful. Thank you! Keep up the stellar work. -Eric
Community This is what I needed to listen to when the election was over. I didn’t want anymore information. Thanks for the post election family meeting. I appreciate you.
Thank you! I love all three of you! My personality is the most like sister, I have traits of Glennon and I want to be best friends with Abby. There are no words that exist to tell you how grateful I am for this podcast. I can’t wait for every Tues and Thurs to listen to a new episode. It can’t be just random that I found your podcast by accident and that every episode pertains to my life in some way. I was meant to find you three.   I am truly sorry about the fear that you are all feeling about the President-elect. My parents are feeling the same way. My husband and I feel relieved. We have been living in fear for the last 3 months if Harris was elected. We feared for our lives and our businesses. We formulated an exit plan if we needed to flee from our home in case of attack from overseas. We have been crunching our #’s relentlessly trying to be ready for every scenario to keep our livelihood afloat. I sent the following text to my 2 older sons a few weeks ago. This is what I believe whole heartedly and the results of the election show me that maybe more Americans feel the same way.   The question we need to ask ourselves in this election is “What can we live with?” Neither side is perfect, but we need to make tough choices. It’s literally about survival. There are country’s that hate us and that are just licking their chops right now hoping that Kamala wins! 1. I cannot live with a World War lll. Kamala is not capable of leading us into battle. I do not want to flee, hide out and lose everything we’ve worked so hard to build.  2. I am pro-choice, but abortion rights don’t matter anymore when we’re all dead.  3. I cannot live with anymore mass immigration. It’s robbing our children’s future…education, safety, etc. It is a scary thing knowing we’re not going to be around later in life to protect you three.  4. I cannot live anymore with our tax dollars taking care of the immigrants while not taking care of our own. We need to finally put our mask on first.  5. I cannot live anymore with prices continuing to rise. We have three children to educate!!! 6. I cannot live with anymore rights taken away…free speech, right to bear arms, etc.  7. I don’t want to live with everything debit- no cash. The risk of taxing our 401k and our real estate. All to support the immigrants coming into our country.  Our country and way of life is slipping through our fingers. If Kamala wins, I want you to be prepared that we may need to make tough choices that we don’t want to make. End  I do not listen to any of the 90% Democratic mainstream media ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, CNN or even FOX. All those stations do is fuel my anxiety and fear. I listen to both Left and Right podcasts and use my own situation in life to come to my own conclusions.   The comment I’ve heard over the last year the most is “I used to be a Democrat. The Republican Party is how the Democrats used to be.” If I had a nickel for every time I heard that! The Democrats have fooled us too many times and we’re all starting to wake up. They have lost our trust! The Dems have been in power for 12 out of the last 16 years. It is not all Trump’s fault for the current state of the country!   Do I like the way Trump speaks? No! Do I like Kamala’s word salad? No! Do I feel safer with Trump? Yes! Would I love a woman president? Yes! Do I feel safe with Harris? No!  I don’t have enough fingers or toes to count how many men I know that don’t have any couth. But, the fact that the media has tarnished Trump’s image with lies is just shameful. Trump has done no different than what other Democrat Presidents have done. I give him a lot of credit for still getting up and fighting as they nail him to the cross over and over. The Dems need to look in the mirror. They are not holier than thou! They have their own demons to face.   Honestly, neither candidate is the end all be all to save this country. But, I do feel that after 4 years we will still have a country in tact to fight for. With Kamala, I did not feel that way.   My hope is that Democrat Americans give Trump the benefit of the doubt. Watch what he does and see after 4 years if we are safer and more prosperous. Let’s stop tearing him down before he even starts. We need a serious change! Biden, Harris and the people pulling the strings did not lead us down the right path. They’re leading us into socialism. A lot of people believe that Trump’s life was spared for a reason. (The fact that the mass media barely covered the assassination and the numerous conspiracies is another story). I sincerely hope that we know the truth sometime in my lifetime.   One more thing… the fact that a Kennedy switched parties is mind blowing! I thought I would never see that day.   Please continue to have the hard conversations and do the hard things. We all need to hear different opinions on everything! That’s what makes up grow and think and change! I will be listening, laughing and crying along with you. I sincerely, Thank you.
Best author ever, but disappointed I love Glennon but the recent political messages degrading anyone who won’t vote in favor of the democratic candidate was really surprising and sad to me. I’m not sure how I feel about this podcast anymore.
Please stop using the word CODEPENDENT when referring to every relationship ill Codependent:  Such an outdated, overused, under explained, and stigmatizing term. Please consider using more inclusive language or more accurate words to describe what you mean. Thank you!
Amazing podcast and community This podcast is the absolute best. Abby, Glennon, and Amanda do such a great job of creating a community of caring, sensitive people who want to see a better world and I truly appreciate their brutal honesty. Their recent post election podcast made me feel less alone and better able to process my feelings. Highly recommend!
Gratitude This show has healing properties. I’m so grateful to Abby, Amanda and Glennon for who they are and how they’ve taught and loved me.
Leaving the Pod Squad I have been an avid listener of this podcast for years and am so disappointed in the direction it’s taken.  As a person whose community was destroyed by Hurricane Helene I’ve never been more aware of how we need each other.  People is all we have, no matter who we vote for.  Yet Amanda, who I’ve always respected most, is going to put her friend on blast who didn’t vote the way she wanted and therefore didn’t “protect” her.  I think you all are a big part of the divisiveness problem in this country and are so privileged that you can dump friends because they vote a certain way since you don’t need them to help you for example… in a natural disaster.  The way my community came together to survive the hurricane had nothing whatsoever to do with politics.  Maybe you should start listening to people who have real problems including threats to their essential needs and see how they feel about their neighbor.  You guys are coming off as extremely elitist and it’s unhelpful and insulting.
Bloviating manhating narcissism When they get divisive and judgmental thinking everyone should think the way they do it’s narcissistic, elitist and frankly cliche. It’s also outright man hating. Episodes are fine if you can handle the constant bloviating about every little minutiae.they create their own mental health crisis. It’s frankly an exhausting podcast. they get political and contradict all the “love” and “self help” they talk about the rest of the time. It can go dark real fast.
Not inclusive Long time listener but I just can’t anymore.  Antisemitic and conformist to only one view.  Unhealthy and overly negative .  Differences of views not welcomed or explored.
Loving, wise and thought provoking Really appreciated the post-election episode all around. So much spaciousness and comfort and loving challenging in so many of the episodes. Love you three
Post election family meeting This was what I needed. Thank you!!
More than a podcast to me Today’s family meeting after the election this week has pushed me finally to write a review of a podcast of which I’ve listened to almost every episode and many multiple times.  It’s also the podcast I share the most with others.  It’s so much more than a podcast.  It’s like group therapy with three of my best friends who are comfortably imperfect (well, except for maybe Abby ;-)) but care so deeply and are trying their best, against all American odds, to make this world a better place.  I relate deeply to Amanda’s confrontation with her whiteness.  I’m freakishly similar to Glennon.  Her description today about the sunrise is an experience I had with the sunset on the night of the election.  She’s such a kindred spirit it’s like listening to my subconscious speak out loud to me.  I feel less alone and less like something is wrong with me, prouder of my huge feelings and my ability to sit with them and say them out loud, more hopeful that vulnerable introverts can be leaders and will save our kids who are now out there in the Hunger Games, because of Glennon.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
C’mon Ladies I feel really sad to leave this review but I’m just shocked at the response. What do you need to be protected from? You are adults with the same rights you’ve always had. To Sister, just because someone in your community votes differently than you doesn’t mean they don’t want the best for you or the community, they might just be prioritizing something else at the moment. Why are you promoting fear? Can we take a second to process these feelings? I voted for Hilary back in 2016 and voted for Trump now. Everyone is allowed to change their views accordingly, let’s do the hard thing here and give each other grace!
Family Meeting Thank you 🫶🏼🙏🏻 I feel a little less lost and alone
Post election- family meeting I really needed to hear this today. Grounded me and helped me feel a sense of realness- especially Abby. 💕
The day after Thank you so much for this. Brought me so many haha moments of yes that’s what I’m feeling thinking. Yesterday was complete despair, I couldn’t even talk, today it’s become rage, out for a walk a Tesla pulled up and started pulling out all the Trump placards from around my neighborhood and I felt such disgust and anger, I know it showed on my face, and I was like “c’mon ask me how I’m doing go ahead ask me a$&hole” well he could barely look at me, brief “mornin” , yeah no! I’m with Abby I’m raging today, but loving the clarity around Who is my community? If you voted against me and my rights, my daughters rights, my nieces rights etc you are not my community you are not my friend, as you said we are not the “United” States we are the Divided States of America, and justice and freedom for who? Not all never has been all, white men, that’s all. They hate us, and sadly 50% of white women also voted against themselves, it’s a hard reality which I did start accepting 8 years ago, what this country really is. Thank you for all the suggestions, thoughts, feelings. As always brilliant ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Life changing Started listening after reading Glennons untamed (which was also life changing and so validating) Such an amazing and iconic trio. I’ve started listening to this when I take my young adult siblings to and from work (we work together) and I’ve caught them both listening to it on their own or asking me follow up questions a few days after on applying it. Listening to this podcast feels like the most gentle loving authentic warm hug. Please never stop
I needed this Post election, I am Abby. Stupid little men
Thank you Thank you to Glennon, Abby, and Amanda for showing up even on these darkest of days. This was the conversation I needed.
Thank you. Thank you for showing up today, the day after the election. I was waiting with anticipation ever since I woke up on Wednesday morning for your podcast to Air on Thursday morning. I knew I would hear the thoughts and feelings that I needed to hear gain a sense of courage for what lies  ahead. I appreciate what you’re doing.
Life Changing Todays post election family meeting changed my life and made me feel less alone in the sadness and disappointment in what I thought was my community. Glennon, Abby and Sister put words to the feelings I couldn’t yet vocalize and I am forever grateful to them for creating this community of like-minded individuals. I love you 3 immensely
Post-Election Family Meeting I really needed to hear this episode. Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing your feelings with us. I related with each one of you. This is such a scary time, it’s easy to get lost in the fear and anger and hurt. I’m so grateful for the reminder to lean into the communities we have created and also rethink the people who make them up. Thank you for doing this podcast - we need it now more than ever.
Post Election Family Meeting This episode was EVERYTHING I needed to hear today. My grief & rage are real & hearing yours was soothing to my soul.  I, like you, will NOT be riding the trump rip current/tidal wave these next 4 years. I did it once- he will not take my mental health again.
Reflective! Thank you ladies for reminding me of what really matters.  Your message on this is spot on!  Nature IS my church!  Walk on!!
Grieving together Post Election Day ep: Thank you Amanda for your action, Glennon for your hope, Abby for your grief. Completely unscripted + each had a different organic gut reaction to how to process this unspeakable pain. I felt inspired by Amanda + Glennon, though today I felt most seen by Abby—all needed, all gifts. Reminds me why we need dear friends (IRL + parasocial) as we don’t all react the same even when core-aligned, + that expands us.
Thank you ! Thank you for your thoughts and for providing a community of positivity in uncertain times
Exactly what I needed This is the only podcast that I listen to and am so glad I listened today to the “Day after the election, family meeting” podcast.  I’ve been feeling rage and hurt and anger and don’t know how to process all of these feelings. Listening to the podcast made me feel not so alone. I’m also starting to feel less helpless for what’s about to come. Thank you to Sister and Glennon and Abbey for sharing your thoughts and feelings. You don’t know how much it helped me. We will get through this and we will persevere.
Post election As an elder Hispanic/Native American woman I appreciated so much of what you are saying about the times we are in. My ancestors have lived, we continue to live this. The Apaches fought longer than any other tribe, my ancestors fled all of this till the bitter end. None of that worked.  We have a new opportunity to create a different nation and as you said, none of this is even close to new It is what this nation was founded on. I stayed in, home yesterday, cried, raged felt the horror that has always existed. The hard work is in the realization that freedom is not individual, rights do not belong to one group. We are not free until we are all free. I love what Amanda said that I can start in my own neighborhood. When I lift one person up and you lift one person up it is the beginning of a wave that transcends politics. I believe that is the antidote to the times we live in. Hate will not get us there. We need the maturity to recognize we need to work together to change this country and that means working with all people. The powers that be have power as long as we believe we are separate. My ancestors passed down trauma AND courage and persistence. Today I choose to remember this.
Thankful for you You are saving me rn - you helped me survive 2016. Thank you. You are my community. You are my people.
Community I have never written before. One of my brothers was really excited to tell me about this podcast soon after you launched, he is the youngest and I am the oldest of a large family and I did a lot of caretaking of him when he was a baby. He showed his love for me by sharing this podcast with me. I am so grateful to be part of this community, especially now. Thank you.
Thank you Thank you so very much for the post-election episode. It was so good for me to hear your voices say what I’m feeling. Wow.  Peace, light and love to you all. 💜☮️💜
Thank you! Thank you for the post election podcast it was what I needed to hear!!!
Mixed feelings I am a Kamala voter and devastated. Listening to this post election podcast I can’t help but feel like the way these women talk is part of what turns people off the Ds. Constant, constant talk about “protect ME” and “I am not SAFE” in a way that frankly feels self-absorbed and off. Clearly, millions of women out there are subject to the same policies and for whatever reason this message doesn’t resonate at all. Glennon in particular sounds like she has the political consciousness of a gen z college student who just learned about empire and capitalism and now considers herself a radical activist while she sits in the comfort of her multimillion dollar home. It feels like it’s about the esthetics of being considered an artist/activist now that she has cast aside other identities she used to think were cool.  This podcast has had a lot of great episodes and I believe it does do good in the world. At the same time two of the three hosts seem to have an almost messianic view of themselves and their role in society. Dial it back. You are not going to save us. We want you to be part of the conversation as you do have much to add, but acting like you speak on behalf of the downtrodden while he did better with all demographics in this election suggests that something is off and maybe you are part of some wider problems in public discourse in this country.
Post election podcast, thank you:) Thank you for showing up for us today. This election loss is one of the most gutwrenching experiences of my life. Just hearing your voices this morning is healing. Thanks for putting your needs aside and being there for us❤️
Healing Deleted all of my political podcasts on the 6th; only talked to God and my immediate family the day after then went looking for something relevant and healing on the 7th & found you 3. Thank you for the conversation, the confirmation, and support.
Important episode This was so helpful to listen to today. Thank you
Life changing I was first introduced to the podcast by my amazing therapist. This podcast has changed my life. I feel more empowered, more confident, and happier after each and every episode! So thankful for this slice of heaven.
WCDHT ❤️
The BEST election coverage Thank you for bringing us meaningful conversations, optimism, and methods for direct action during this difficult election season. I’ve been listening to the pod since the very beginning, and I feel like the past few years were built up to this moment. Thank you for all you have done to share these powerful voices with us. May the best woman win! 🇺🇸 (And OMG, talking to Elizabeth Warren would have me in tears, too!)
PETE Amazing podcast with Pete Buttigieg. What a smart, articulate and kind person and leader. Awesome, election changing advice!
Thank you It is always so comforting to listen to you all. I listen to every episode and I light up when I see a new episode waiting for me! Thank you for all you do.
Essential listening Essential listening for being a human and surviving/thriving today
Practice what you preach Been listening to this podcast since the beginning. Don’t always agree with your messages but I try to always listen with an open mind and often learn some things and appreciate your perspective. Wish you would be less judgmental, tribal and dismissive of other opinions. Today’s podcast with Pete Buttigieg was a perfect example. “The other side” is the problem, tribal, dangerous etc. Maybe you don’t even see that you are exactly like “the other side”. There seems to be no room for differing opinions or perspectives. You have a large following and assume that the podsquad thinks and feels exactly like you. Your not so subtle messaging reads ….if you dont agree with us you are not one of us! Sounds alot like “the other side” don't you think? Would love to see and hear your viewpoints expand and be more accepting and inclusive.
ICE!! I needed todays episode- love in my heart & ice in my veins!
I need your help What a great discussion with Secretary Pete! Thank you!
This episode with Mayor Pete is saving me right now! Thank you, thank you thank you for this episode the day before the election! This episode with Pete was a balm for my anxious soul.
Needed a break from this In the episode about raising older kids Glennon mentioned “ the Palestinian genocide” very triggering for me. Didn’t expect that anti- Israel trope from a podcast I’d come to love. Gonna take a break from these ladies for a while.
This is a light at the end of my tunnel The positivity and joy and authenticity in this podcast are getting me through my darkest and hardest season yet. I am gripping onto the hope here. Highest recommendation. ❤️
Incredibly Enthusiastically Monumentally Thankful I am drawn to tears as I write how deeply grateful I am for these women and this podcast. Their voices, stories, humor, incites into the world, and truth-telling inspire me everyday to love myself a little bit more and embrace all that comes my way with open arms. I am so full of joy that I get to be on the planet the same time as these incredible women.
This podcast makes me feel human!! I am so very thankful for this pod! It is such a generous offering to the world from Glennon, Abby, & (S)Amanda 😁. I remember that in a past episode G mentioned how (a program like) AA helped her to understand how to be a human (possibly botching that, but still…) and I feel like the We Can Do Hard Things Pod has been instrumental into helping me understand how to be human, a mother, a friend, etc. I never miss an episode and frequently go back to relisten! One of my all time faves was with Dr. Galit Atlas and her work on Intergenerational Trauma (wow!!)!! Thank you for the work that you are doing Glennon, Abby, & Amanda (& TEAM!!!!). Xoxo
Life-changing Pod I’ve listened to every episode, many of them more than once. I’ve gotten more life-enhancing wisdom frm this pod than I’ve gained on my own frm  experiencing life on this earth for the last 61 freaking yrs! So grateful to these amazing women, their guests (many of whom I’d never heard of before), and my fellow pod-squadders for being so vulnerable and sharing so much of themselves w me (well, w the world, really, but it feels like they’re just talking to me…in a good way, not in some weird delusional way!!!)
Raising Older Kids A great episode, giving language to the changing relationship in raising older kids. As a parent of. 37 and 34 year old, a lot of your feelings still apply. Kelly Corrigan’s podcast episode with Maya Shankar (on how the empty nest is going) has an applicable mantra:  Can’t get enough. Don’t need a thing.
10-31-24 Episode Glennon, you moved me to tears several times in this episode. Thank you for speaking the most achingly beautiful words to describe this parenting phase. I’m right there with you… learning how to love with a fully open heart and learning to let them go with fully open hands. We can do hard (and melancholy) things.
Disappointed I was an avid listener for years and felt like one of the pod squad, but it’s been a while since I’ve listened to an episode. I recently listened to a show and was flabbergasted to hear you say the “Genocide in Palestine”??? Have you done your homework? Don’t know what actually happened and is happening????  Hamas (terrorists) want genocide on Israel and all Jews dead. They killed, raped, burned, tortured 1500 Israelis (from 7plus countries ) and killed family members in front of  babies, small children, siblings, grandparents and took 250 hostages. They have killed many, raped and tortured them keeping them in dark tunnels with scares air, food and water and no showers. 101 hostages are still being held. Why aren’t you demanding their release? How can you say what you’re saying. Shameful……  You have it backwards. I thought you were educated and I have been a fan for years.  Wow. Mind blown. This is a sad day. I hope you know you have lost another Jewish follower. I will be spreading the news….
Women’s voices matter I went to an all girl school in the 1980-90s that tried to Empower girls to seek education and careers just like men. But the problem was, we were only being educated about men, and sometimes about men’s versions of women. But the gaping chasm of actual women’s voices created an obstacle that was hard to overcome. Internalized misogyny that took years of therapy to outgrow. I’m so grateful to Glennon and Abby and Gillian for bringing their voices to the table so that everyone girls and boys can listen to history and talk about the future. With joy and sadness with enthusiasm and regret this podcast helps me continue to grow and learn.
Glennon Doyle is a gift wrapped in anxiety I love this Podcast, it is so honest and authentic. She uses humor to balance the hard parts of her humanity., without compromising the reality. Glennon Doyle shows us what beauty exists within a mental health diagnosis. The listener is afforded a front row seat into her process; Glennon and her sister take the first steps on the path to doing hard things. They lend the listener their strength to move forward until the listener’s confidence rises. Brava
Conversations that make me a better person Abby, Glennon, and Amanda having thoughtful, vulnerable, and insightful conversations with people who have valuable knowledge to consider. This show is tremendously helpful, kind, and inspiring. Thank you.
Pure magic! Glennon, I don’t how your voice and your story and your energy does it but every time, brings tears to my eyes! I think it’s the beauty and freedom of pure honesty you share and inspire. Thank you Abby and Amanda as well, Abby I love your book also and Amanda you are a joy 💜
Changed my life! Looking back on the past year, I realized how this podcast has lunged me forward in some massive, positive ways. It has been my therapy❤️
Hard Things Bring in the Light & Love XO
Amazing and Informative Podcast This is probably my favorite podcast series that I enjoy listening to. There are things that are talked about that are normally not talked about. Glennon, Abbey, and Amanda are absolutely amazing human beings. I love what they stand for, and how they advocate for the rights of others.
"Making Corrections" politically timely Every episode teaches me something, even when I'm uncertain a topic/guest applies to me. If you have had a heated (political or otherwise) disagreement with family, wow will this "Making Corrections" episode hit home! It taught 3 basic human needs & how to approach differences, respectfully share information, and disagree but still love each other. Grateful for the lessons during a time of such heated political divide!!Thank you!
What I needed It’s Friday and all my duties are done for now and it’s finally time I get to write my novel. I’ve been away from the page a week and I’m scared if my project is worth it. Easily distracted by the “more important” world. Enter this podcast to give me the courage to use the languished heart and skills. To just try to start again on the shaping tasks I left off at. To rediscover the freedom. Thank you.!
An intimate Soul searching Marathon! There is something for everyone…even when you least expect it! The true meaning of showing up with a purpose. Luv you guys
Best part of my week The best podcast with the most authentic voices on the Internet. It’s the best part of my week and I’m so grateful to Abby, Glennon, and Sister.
Tim Walz Thanks for having Tim Walz on …..he is a breath of fresh air ! PLEASE VOTE for human decency …people who genuinely care about others.
Coach is a breath of fresh air Thanks for hosting him! This episode is smart, informative and accessible.
This show has literally changed my life Not only do I find a sense of camaraderie and sisterhood when I listen to the show, but I feel like I am sitting at a gathering with my most vulnerable and authentic friends. I have been inspired to quit drinking, learn more about what my enneagram can teach me, and I am about to take a deep dive into internal family systems work. I have been sober for nine months because of these strong and tenacious and dedicated and visionary and courageous womyn. I know that I did the work myself to get there, but I don’t think I would’ve done it without listening to their stories. Thank you for touching the core of my being and changing my life.
Informative, Transparent and Wise I so appreciate the introductions and deeper conversations to diverse topics through great speakers, books and so much more.  I always feel better educated and informed after listening to a podcast. These women have my trust and respect. They walk their talk. Thank you so much for sharing research based info during these years of fake information. -Dr. Karin Lubin
It’s like free education & therapy! Must listen and follow!! Informative and uplifting!! I’ve learned so much and recommend it to many! Guests are spectacular and so are the hosts. I always finish each episode a little wiser, more knowledgeable, and more hopeful. Thank you!!!
Just another  echo chamber Sadly, this show has become an echo chamber for Doyle’s narcissism. What started as a real potential for something different, has morphed into a leftist-only space that alienates those who share multi-faceted views of the world. Sad.
Love to listen! I look forward to listening to every new episode!
My fav week after week Thank you to Glennon, Abby, and Amanda for creating such a funny, educational, and heart felt show. I have learned about so many people’s work through the show, and also tune in just to feel held and inspired by you three. Thank you!!
Centering and Educational WCDHT makes me feel warm inside. Clearheaded, honest, emotional, unapologetic, and calming.   Amanda, Glennon, and Abby’s voices are pleasant and easy to listen to. If a warm smile could be a podcast, this would be it, the show feels like when you see an old friend you used to LOL with.  🌈
Essential listen! I’ve been following Glennon since the early days of Momastery. Her work with Abby and Sister on this podcast is vulnerable, honest and life affirming. I am reassured by the bravery of these three amazing women and all of the things I learn from them and their guests. Brava! and thank you!
Love I love this podcast so much. I listen to it every week and it brings me so much! One thing drives me bananas is when Amanda suddenly speaks in a quiet voice, and I can no longer hear anything she is saying!
What a great podcast! I love listening to “WeCan Do Hard Things”. The terrific Trio always has something that I’m interested in. Today it was Ina Garten sharing her story and making it safe to bust out of the mold . They encourage, inspire  and support , plus I always learn something new!
Favorite po I am such a fan and proud member of the pod squad. This show has been so healing on a cellular level. I share episodes with friends and family-to the point where i annoy people! These women are my spirit guides to becoming my most authentic self. Thank you for this important work!
The important stuff This podcast is a belly laugh, a warm hug, a soft gut check, and an extra deep breath. As a queer trauma therapist and also just human wanting to consume things that are good for all parts of me—-this podcast covers so many important conversations that I want to be a part of and ones that I’ve shared with clients who I’ve felt might benefit from them. It’s done with so much humility, honesty, and meaning. I can’t say enough good things. Every time I take a little bit of a break from podcasts, I come back to this one and it’s like coming home every time 🖤
Last episode Just a comment on the other side of the dishwasher debate. It doesn’t matter how much time I spend trying to load the dishwasher “correctly”. My husband will rearrange it. So I have stopped trying to load it correctly. (If he’s not home and I load my way, they come out just as clean)
Like, Right? “Like, you know, like, right”? How about if you speak without adding in  “like” and “right” constantly? It really makes you sound immature and not very bright.
Game Changing This is a game changing podcast. Been in therapy for three years dealing with issues and trauma. Listening to this just makes me determined to not pass this on!
Irresponsible, dangerous and privileged I was on board until Glennon described mental health medications and eating disorders as “coping mechanisms” in the Sept 11 episode.  Let’s be clear: Medications SAVE countless lives by treating chemical imbalances. Eating disorders TAKE countless lives that can be saved by treating those chemical balances.   The irresponsibility and privilege continues as she describes raging at others as a result of her self-described unmediated, disregulated self.
Amazing Podcast! I listen weekly. I feel like I’m hanging with close, totally supportive & wise friends.   Thank you for bringing back Tish’s song at the end! I really missed it - and I guess others did too!!!
Grateful I love this podcast so much! It always makes me think and often makes me see things (and myself) differently. Because of this show, I’m getting a breast MRI, and not using other people to regulate myself. Thank you thank you thank you!
Learning to be gentle with myself Thank you Glennon, Abby, Sister and all of your inspiring guests for creating a safe space for vulnerability, self-reflection and letting go. WCDHT is helping me to use gentle parenting on myself so I can realize the best version of myself and model the kind of world I want to live in ❤️💖❤️
Quieting the inner critic This podcast was great. It validated but most important put a name on what I have been doing for my 35 years of recovery, practicing self compassion… what I love that you all do, is you ask a question and then give the person huge space to answer- how refreshing. I am 72 and get so much out of your show… and share it with others.warmly Eileen
How to save the world and yourself Amazing deep thoughtful and somehow healing episode. Thank you
Thanks! 😊 I wanted to thank you for this podcast, it has provided me with some useful information and support. For example, the recent one about intergenerational trauma. Also in episode 344, the profound observation about our fear of being consumed by what we didn’t get in childhood, in my case this relates to a core wound regarding attachment and nurturance, which has had a negative effect on my dating and romantic life.  I also loved the episode about embarrassing moments in our lives!
So real I have been listening for a year or two now. It is so helpful to hear real people talk about real problems and their experiences. The weirdest part about the podcast is that Glennon and Abby and Amanda manage to talk about things before they ever happened to me, and although painful, it helps when the issues come up and I understand them better. Thank you for everything you do!
Learning to Love without Control Thank you for your vulnerability, you are so brave. I am a 43-year-old mother of three. You give me the courage to continue to work my stuff out. Life is very hard. You are a light to a lot of people suffering because of addiction. I’m going to a meeting today! I have so much love and respect for you!
Life Giving! The dynamic and magic that happens with Glennon, Abby, and Amanda is truly life giving! Listening each week to this podcast has provided me with deep conversations with my sister and my husband, and thus, has enriched my relationships with them. Listening to the podcast I cry, laugh, smile, reflect, and journal on all the conversations as it’s all about being human. I absolutely do not miss one episode. Thank you to Glennon, Abby, and Amanda for this weekly breath of fresh humanness. It reminds me I’m not alone. There is a strong sense of “with-ness,” togetherness. Community.  And special shout out to this episode: 346. How to Break Family Cycles: Dr. Mariel Buqué. WOW. Parenting a 4 year old has absolutely turned me inside out and I at times feel that I mess up on a daily basis, but to be reminded that we are all navigating trauma and that every moment is an opportunity—wow. Thank you. Today I blew up and I repaired with my daughter and there was so much healing in that moment. A moment is huge. Thank you. Love y’all!
Listen to Jessica Ayellin It’s crazy to me that you start the podcast off that has Jessica Ayellin on it, spouting misinformation. She would love to talk to you about what is going on in Gaza, and how it’s being reported. I was a loyal listener and have stopped listening due to the misinformation you spread about this conflict on your instagram and on your show. It is notable that you disabled comments on the picture you posted of the slain hostages. Are you afraid of what your followers will comment? - a former podsquad member.
Love these ladies! Glennon, Abby and Amanda, you rock! As a mental fitness coach specializing with athletes both on and off court, I applaud the diverse group of people they interview who have credentials out the ying/yang! However, how they each share authentically and transparently is their secret sauce that makes me come back over and over, salivating as I wait to hear their next podcast!
Annoying and depressing. Gave this a shot but it’s super depressing.
Change of life This podcast changes my life with each episode. My favorite episode has been “How to deal with emotionally immature partners/parents”. I gain new understanding of myself and the people in my life each time I listen. Thank you so much for sharing all of these thoughts and feelings, and for all of the incredible, amazing people that you interview!  Dayne Frost
The best pod cast ever I have been listening since the start of the Pod Squad. I absolutely love it! The host give me so much hope. I am committed to “unlearning” and changing myself to help change the world around me. So many thanks to these wonderful people who are inspiring “good trouble!”
Being good with our whole selves I love this podcast. It’s the only one that I listen to every episode. Glennon, Abby, Amanda, bring their whole selves, the parts who have grown and learned ways of being and handling things that are better for all involved, and the parts that make mess up embarrassingly. Their ability not to disown those less skillful more triggered parts helps me recognize that I can still be a good person even when I have had a triggered mess moment. I think I need this modeled and stated to me approximately 5,682,594 times for me to fully embody it. So, it’s a start, hey? 🤪
Learning to love without control I was so excited to listen. I have been on Prozac for 20 years after difficulty with menopause symptoms and divorce. I have tried to get off but can not breakthrough. What do I do with myself when I go through that? I’m listened to how Glennon felt watching others cry but not feeling it the way she thought they did. I feel it but I don’t always cry. I did go through withdraw on a different med and cried so much. It is cleansing but since I am still able to feel and cry I just don’t know if I can go off the meds even though I want to. Thanks for sharing. Love you all. Shellie
So brave Thanks for always showing up and showing true authenticity to all of us. You all make me want to be more honest. Radical truth. Thanks for leading in that publicly. LOVE 💕
Brutiful Thank you for sharing the coming off meds journey to rock bottom. I’ve been attending Al-anon since July and it has been as you said “takes the edge off” just enough. And it helps to have a goal. The chaos remains in my brain of course but I appreciate the process and hope. The pod is always a journey! Thank you again.    Still listening after all these years and usually moved tears. Keeping all of you close to my heart thank you for everything you do. Looking forward to learning how to become emotionally immature. Kidding!! Love ❤️ the pod. Thank you for this weeks doubleheader. I can’t get enough of the intelligent, compassionate, thoughtful way the team speaks to its audience and guests. It’s elevated and authentic. Thank you!!
Do-Dependent So happy that Glennon shared her story to get to Al Anon. You’re in the right place!
Fantastic What a breath of fresh air ! I love hearing all the  stories   honest life stories !!  it’s refreshing to hear the real!
Life changing I’m almost 40, mom of 2 , a tween and a preschooler. Everything yall discuss resonates with me so much. Your conversations have helped me so much navigate all my relationships. Love you three so much thank you for being vulnerable and raw and honest. I look forward to hearing you every week. Proud proud member of the pod squad
Love this show! Always insightful snd informative with real human feelings and problems
Abby and Grief Thank you Abby for opening up and sharing your grief story in episodes 340 and 341. I too lost my older brother suddenly last year and your story was so similar to how I felt. It was really helpful to hear and share with someone going through the same thing.
Wonderful recommendation from my friend! My neighbor told me about this podcast and I’ve been listening daily ever since! I have 49 episodes left! I listen on 2x speed, because I want to absorb it so quickly. But I do find myself pausing it often to process what they’re saying and allow myself time to really sit with it all. I come from a background with church and religious trauma and have left all things church and god - so I do appreciate the generalization of god being nature or anything greater than myself OR even myself!
Free therapy I always feel lighter after hanging out with these women. It’s like a therapy session during my work commute. Thank you for shining the light you shine. Also- I have a crush on Abby.  😁
Insightful, warm, fun This is the only podcast I can listen to constantly. I love the variety of topics and their willingness to share their experiences so vulnerably and generously. I’m always hooked intellectually, emotionally, and feel a sense of belonging listening along. Impressive, accessible, life changing. Such wise women who never take themselves too seriously.
Episode numbers? Long time fan! Love what y'all do. But I'm having a hard time following episode numbers recently. Don't mind that you share repeats - there have been some awesome ones! But it helps if I can know whether it's a repeat or not and what the original episode number was.  Thanks!!
Invaluable series on breast cancer My sister is a faithful member of the pod squad. She has often sent me episodes that have been insightful and helpful. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, she send me links to the podcasts on Amanda’s story and those with Dr. Bren. It has been a huge source of information, calm, and hope.  Thank you for being willing to share so much of yourselves to help us all do hard things. ❤️
I Keep Coming Back This is such an honest podcast and you can’t help but love all three of these wonderful women. They are not afraid to show and even discuss their flaws. After all we are all human. They have fantastic guests, and they contribute so much to their faithful listeners. I am of a different generation and yet I enjoy every show I listen to. Kudos to them for being so brave and honest and tackling the hard things!
Thank you, Abby I just listened to the Abby episode about experiencing the death of her brother. Glennon was right, Abby: all we want is to hear you talk more. Thank you for sharing this really hard experience with all of us. I’ll bet your Eulogy was so lovely, and exactly what people needed to hear on that day.
The best! We can do hard things The best part of my day
Life Affirming and Soul-Filled This podcast and the three women who lead it is one of the most uplifting, soul-full, and inspiring parts of my day. I am so thankful for Glennon, Abby, and Sister and for their honesty and vulnerability. I feel like I am becoming a more mindful human and that I'm not alone in this world knowing that there's a whole Pod Squad of humans inspired by these three!! Thank you for the hope and joy that you spread with your stories and words.
Love love love this podcast! This is my favorite podcast to listen to. I love the topics, guests and hosts. It’s very real and vulnerable. Thank you for sharing your lives with us.
Exactly it. I think this podcast is changing my life. And the individuals they host for conversations are changing my life. Life is hard… and I just want to thank you so much for sharing how you do hard things.
Hope… Would love Amanda Ripley to work with Kamala and Trump! I met Kamala already knows a lot about this. Such an enlightening episode!
My Lifeline for All the Hard Things Amanda, Glennon, and Abby- you all had me sobbing in my car today after a EMDR therapy session in the best possible way. Sitting in that parking lot, with the weight of my upcoming divorce looming while I tackle all the healing and the telling of the kids and the complete unknown that is in front of me, I just felt seen. Again. As I always do when I listen to you. You three have a way of speaking to the human condition that is a true gift. You are healing people. You helped heal my heart today. I love you. I appreciate you. Thank you. 💙
Abby’s Grief I am so thankful that Abby shared about the loss of her brother. I related to so much of what she said. I lost my sister to suicide in 2016. She was 42. Abby, if you read this I think you might relate to my book, The Requirement of Grief (I’m sorry that sounds so self promotey bleh, but I do think that a sibling loss is unique and I think the book could be helpful although it’s not available on audiobook which I know  is how you read a lot.) Anyway, I’m so sorry about your brother, but I love the way you have moved with your grief. The podcast is outstanding.
I appreciate this ❤️❤️❤️ I have actually looked up many of the authors who have been on and read their books. Such a good way to gain access to various ideas and new information. I also appreciate the woman power that runs through everything.  I especially appreciated the episodes on Neurodiversity and Autism Spectrum.
I listen twice sometimes I listen to a lot of podcasts. Like, a lot of them. But I still run thru the list of current episodes sometimes and when I do, I listen to one of these again. I learn something new. I hear a thing I need to share with a friend or fellow. Or I just get really good advice like “stop asking directions to places they’ve never been.”
There is no better show Glennon is my hero and my idol. When untamed came out I found her and I’ve read all three of her books at least five times each.  She showed me how to heal. She showed me that it’s OK to be imperfect. She showed me it’s OK to be me.  Since meeting Abby and sister, I’ve grown to love them as much. These three women are my everything and I’d be lost without them.  My partner and I are going to be having a baby soon and I talk about these three women as being the most excellent mom I know.   Love all three of you so much.
Abby’s Loss Thank you for sharing your loss Abby, it was amazing and heartfelt. I am also the youngest of seven, we lost our Mother when she was 55. I was 22, my oldest sibling was 32, large Catholic family. You validated my anger and confusion at that time 35 years ago. You also mentioned losing your brother earlier in the year, maybe February. You spoke about what to do with the energy you shared with your brother. That was eye opening for me.   Also, you didn’t talk too much, every word was a blessing and testament to the love you have for your brother. Great job, he is so proud of you. ❤️
¡¡¡Gracias!!! ¡¡¡Gracias, gracias, gracias y más gracias por la compañía!!!
Appreciate Your Inclusive and Vulnerable Approach I marvel at the talent you Glennon, Amy and Amanda have for creating a meaningful and impactful “We Can Do Hard Things Community” through your podcast every week. Every conversation is so well done! It’s hard to pick a favorite but among the top are the interviews with Dr. Richard Schwartz on family systems, Dr. Rachel Bhrem on breast cancer (I am a 20 year survivor this year), everything with Liz Gilbert, and this weeks edition with Governor Christine Whitmer. I’ve been listening weekly for about two years and look forward to it you are part of my community now. I would miss you greatly if you weren’t! The podcast is also among the resources I pass along to many of the nonprofit organization leaders I coach. We are all better off because of you! Thank you!
Awesome podcast I am so grateful for your wisdom, authenticity and kindness. I listen to every podcast and truly love all of you.  Thanks for being you.  Don’t change a single thing!  Hugs
Mortifying moments This episode. I was listening while walking on a fairly busy trail. With earbuds in I was laughing out loud. When Abby got to her story about the wicker basket I was literally peeing in my (dark navy) pants & had to stop & lean over. A biker stopped to ask if I was ok. “Absolutely, thanks!” I replied.  Bring that joy, ladies. 😁
Women in government What a great episode. I appreciate how you deliver access to such amazing people
glennon doyle loves sadness and the man with the wooly wooly face she steals things and 🦶🏽
hated it so much 🦶
Parenting Teens episode I loved this one - full of real insight and empathy.  Home run!
PARENTING ADVICE I was touched by the incredible thoughtfulness and concern of Glennon, Abby, and Amanda in parenting their kids. 🥹
The best kind of conversation I am so incredibly grateful to you Abby, Glennon and Amanda - for your authenticity and sharing your conversations with me and the world. I feel so fortunate to have found this podcast. I laugh out loud (Macaroni Grill) cry (Alice’s 1 miler) and find words to put to my complicated feelings and experiences. I feel like, wow, I’m not alone, there are other amazing women navigating life in a thoughtful, introspective, joyful, wholehearted way. I know this kind of public life takes a toll. Thank you for generously sharing with all of us. Your podcast is life affirming and is changing the world one heart and hard conversation at a time. Love you guys.  I know you’re taking heat for the political conversations. Thank you for having them. Keep going!!
Love this shoe Thank for bring real and sharing life through the lens of “spirituality” learning to love and embrace our true selfs!
Re: the awkward soccer player I’m totally with Glennon. I am not ok with her wearing the crest. She has a job playing for a club, so she has that. The USWNT represents all of us, and there were very talented players who could have easily taken that roster spot. It was a choice and one with which I strongly disagree.
My journey’s mirror Abby and Sissy, I adore you both so much and am grateful for your perspectives and brave moments you all share. And Glennon… I could listen to you talk endlessly. Every few minutes, I’m deeply moved by your heart’s wise response to how you experience the internal and external world. Your authenticity is presented with creative and resonating language, and I appreciate you so much for the modeling you give women, and men as well. My journey as a man has been to clear the thorns from the path back to my heart through experiencing my grief, my anger, my anxiety, and my joy, using each as a compass towards healing opportunities. As a mental health counselor who works with children, parents, and adult men primarily, I strive to hold space for their emotional compass and de/re-program their beliefs that have been fed to them with their own light. Thank you for being a lighthouse, for your guidance, and for sharing the mirror to my light. Each of your courage is inspirational!
What a great podcast Listen to them all but this last  one with Brittney was so powerful. Really made me think about things somewhat differently. My thought process was there however could not formulate it the way you all did. You continue to uplift me since your days in Naples, the first Pride Event here and your other gatherings. Thanks so much for all you do and offering up your authentic self.     Tracey  Naples, Florida
Powerful women is no a dirty word Thank you for this. Stand up for your cause and find your community it is the only way we can survive in a society where we can live with our heads held high.
A Must for Women (and Men) I recently started listening to Brenee Brown’s podcast and early on she had Glennon Doyle on her show. OMG! Glennon turned a light bulb on in my brain that I didn’t even know existed. She spoke so much truth to me and I had to start listening to We Can Do Hard Things. I love this podcast! It states the obvious in a way that makes me really listen! It makes me laugh and makes me THINK! I love getting my husband’s perspective on what is discussed and it has been an incredible tool for us to connect on, especially when we disagree.
Y’all are my friends!! But can politics be a boundary? I too, get so excited when a new episode comes on! I am an avid listener, have read all of y’all’s books, and recently have been disheartened at the political episodes. I would love if we could keep politics separate for the sake of outreach of love to everyone. I am also a lover of American history (Glennon, have you read “Killing the Witches” about the Salem Witch Trials? I feel that you would love it!) and recognize that our America now is educated and confused and the political world is full of hate and love, lies and honesty, on all sides. The best thing we can do is be united in civilian activism within our own communities of going forward, the path blazing way, of leaving  things better than we found them, which is what I feel y’all have done successfully, until politics crept in. These are big names to have on the show, but I will speak for myself that the names i’d rather see pop up are the Brene Browns, Andrea Gibsons, Elizabeth Gilberts (although, you can’t duplicate those women!! They are hero’s themselves!) and people just conquering hard things!   Can yall please go back to this? If I could sit down and have dinner with anyone, it would still be you three. The stories we could share about overcoming trauma would be a soul-stirring and soul-stilling night. I met Brene recently at an event and shared with her how others think I’m crazy to do the things I’m doing…. What was her response? “Stay crazy”. Can yall do that, too? Stay crazy. Life is hard, the war on a specific religion or specific political party will never be won, until deity (I believe Jesus) comes again! I want to keep being the crazy with y’all that is passionate about life outside the box.. not the crazy that ruminates on these unforgiving wars.  Thank you Amanda, Glennon and Abby! And to the producers of this show. I hope y’all and your families are all in good health (Amanda 🙏 👙💪).   Love, Becca
Kara Swisher what are you DOING?! I really wanted to hear the Kara Swisher episode but DANG woman you swallow so many of your words and drop your voice 5 notes at the end of your sentences. Maybe she didn’t want us to hear what she was saying but I was turning up my audio high then had to quickly turn it down again when the host was yelling in my ear. Probably a good podcast but either I’m losing my hearing or you guys gotta adjust before Ms Swisher comes back on.
Briana Scurry I truly enjoyed the podcast with Briana Scurry!  It took me back to when she played.  What a great role model!  I have been trying to watch her documentary and have been unable to find it anywhere.  Could you possible direct me in the right direction, I would really love to see it.  Keep guys keep up the great job of educating us and keeping us informed.
Five stars to all of their episodes but today - Christine Blasey Ford One of the best podcasts around. I didn’t watch the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh. Didn’t pay close attention to all they did to CBF. Shame on me. My heart couldn’t handle it. Lots of good insight in this episode. I’ll be starting her book asap. But one of the most profound takeaway’s from this episode is that **most people did believe what she said supreme Court justice Kavanaugh did did actually happen. It’s just that they didn’t care. ** They approved his nomination anyway. If we do not stand up for ourselves as women then this will continue to happen. All of it.
Bummed My all-time favorite podcast, and I have treasured every episode up until all of the political ones lately. Whenever my phone chimes that there is a new episode, I get excited, but once I see it’s yet another political episode I get pretty discouraged. That’s not what I look forward to from you all. ❤️‍🩹
Wow! I’ve loved the 3 episodes I’ve heard were incredibly helpful. On the third episode and in the “friend hacks” when was talked about the attention to communication we need to have to keep our friendships up to date and decide how to handle sensitive subjects that would usually end up in some for of miss communication.  Also I love how Abby gets you all passionate about the products she announces! Great salesperson.
Great chemistry with these 3 Love this podcast. They are very honest about who they are.  Great guests. Feels like a liberal perspective without going too woke which often feels like pandering.  Keep up the good work!
WCDHT hits all my bases Checks all my boxes, all metaphors all the time. Funny, interesting, talks about things I’m thinking about before I know I’m thinking about them, all 3 hosts bring different perspectives which matches up with the guests in really cool ways. I learn a lot but I’m laughing so much, crying appropriately (usually when I need it.) Recovery conscious and LGBTQ+ steeped. And good bridge and support for people with new exposure to either. Like, if you are sober or lesbian, (or both. Hi.) it’s a bullseye. But if your niece just came out trans or your sister’s queer, it may even be better. Listen and love.
Constant aha moments!!! I get aha moments during every episode. What a beautiful tool to help me grow! I also love sharing with my friends! What could be better than discussing these eureka moments with people I love.
Episode 241… …on being left out got me through an extremely challenging time. Your humor and authenticity and understanding of this lived experience helped me get back to myself. I also will never hear the word orangutan again without cracking up. Thank you 🧡
Best pod ever Believe it or not, I am a straight Republican and love this podcast. I have learned so much and been enlightened by the conversations and guests on this pod. It is also help me tremendously when my daughter came out as gay.  If you want to live a wholehearted life and  break free from some narrow-minded, deep rooted belief systems, you have to listen to this podcast!  Game-changer!!!
Love the guests! This show is always spot on with topics and guests. Keep up the good work ladies!
Unity lost Once a beacon of human connection, this podcast has veered dangerously into divisive political territory. While the hosts normally champion diversity, their narrow focus on certain political viewpoints creates an echo chamber rather than a platform for genuine dialogue. It's a shame to see a show with such potential squandered on partisan rhetoric. I hope post-election we can return to enjoy episodes of the  shared experiences that unite us, not divided us.
I love this show except…. Politics are everywhere, every app I open, all over the news, all over the radio, and in so many podcasts….i thought this would be the one safe haven community away from all the political minutiae and opinions…..feeling overwhelmed and sad that so much focus has been put on politics here lately
Karen Swisher Great
Kara Thank you so much for interviewing Kara Swisher!  Her explaining JD Vance and the tech brows is so helpful in understanding the current political environment.  I appreciate you helping educate us and taking a stand against toxic politics.  This was SO insightful!  We can do hard things!  #Harris2024
We truly can do hard things I love listening to Amanda, Glennon and Abby because they aren’t preachy and they do not pass judgement; rather, their goal is to share, educate and help. And I am here for it.
I appreciate your voices Thank you for being unapologetically yourselves.  Listening to the three of you process, laugh, cry and just completely be yourselves has helped me understand so many things in my own world.  Thank you for talking about the hard things. Thank you for processing the hard things out loud, so the rest of us have some insight on how to deal with the gut punches life throws our way.  I appreciate all of you more than you could ever know. Thank you!
Too far You have become way to political and one sided.  I was disappointed with your complete bashing of the Republican Party. I don’t vote party and I try to listen to both sides and vote person and policy.  Everything you claim is wrong with the republicans is also what’s wrong with the Democratic Party today. The venom of which you spoke of people was disheartening as they live their country and are afraid of what’s happening just as much as the Democrats. It’s a few in power that are running our country I to the ground. We should be fighting together to get them out. Not support the current administration or anyone who continues to devalue and destroy our nation. Follow the money - the Democrats have come very far over the last 30 years in catching up to the Republicans bank accounts. Most of whom have never worked outside of politics. You can’t deny this truth. Biden is as big of a criminal as Trump. Clinton a philanderer and so on and so on.  We need less not more government. They are not for us any longer. But don’t fall into the we hate all republicans and anyone who votes for Trump. They’re as afraid as you.
Palestine Just curious if y’all will continue to support Kamala if she continues to support the genocide of Palestinians?
Fantastic!!!!! I really loved the recent Jessica Yellin episodes. So informative! It’s also great to see them rallying for a good cause (again). Kamala for President!
Reproductive rights Loved the talk with Kamala Harris! Thank you so much for what you guys do!
Thx for Kamala Harris episode I am a periodic listener of most of the podcasts I follow - including this one, which is great. I did not hear the Kamala Harris interview at original airing and appreciate you queuing it up this week. Very important messaging, especially now that she is the Presidential nominee!! Thank you. WE CAN DO HARD THINGS!
Thank you! I want to thank you for today’s podcast with Kamala Harris. I appreciate your courage in airing this episode, especially during such a consequential presidential election. Your willingness to engage with diverse perspectives is crucial, particularly when the outcomes of this race could have long-lasting impacts. Thank you for your efforts to unite women and for the meaningful work you do. XOXOXOXO
President Biden I hated the disrespect you gave to President Biden on Thursdays episode. He and his administration have done great things over the past 3+ years.  We had a democratic primary process where I and many voted for the ticket knowing if something happened to Biden, Kamala was ready to take over, now or in 2 years. I am supporting her but am not convinced the society you often lament over that is misogynistic and racist will vote for a minority female.  Private discussion is one thing that I do believe should have happened but I feel like the public bashing from elites did more damage to Joes chances than the Republican Party had done and that is shameful.   You compared it to taking car keys away from an aging parent but I hope you would never do that to your parents in front of their friends, neighbors or the whole freaking world that you have on this platform. I sure hope the gamble of going with a woman at this time pays off because if not we are in serious trouble.
I never don’t want to listen. “I never don’t want to listen to an episode” is how I described this podcast to a friend and I want to share that here as well. I deeply appreciate the nuance, the vulnerability, and the accountability that Glennon, Aby, and Amanda consistently show. The topics they tackle have helped me in immeasurable ways, from how I interact in relationships, to books I have sought out, to other help I have found for myself all based on the inspiration these episodes have given me. I also believe that this podcast has had a positive knock on affect and has helped people around me as well. As has been mentioned many times on the pod- there is no such thing as one way liberation. Thank you so much for the work you are doing, for the doors you are opening, and beauty you are bringing into the world. I am profoundly grateful. 🙏🏼🤍
Love y’all Listening to your podcasts are some of the best parts of my week. Thank you for the episode with Jessica Yellin and getting this message out. Biden was a fantastic president and it’s time for him to move on. There are already super troubling signs that are democracy is already in decline and has been for some time. We need a leader who can articulate what needs to be done to strengthen our nation, inspire and bring energy, and improve the lives of Americans.
They feel like family I just love this podcast. Thank you Glennon, Abby, and Amanda for all the love, blood, sweat, tears that you put into this beautiful podcast. I have cried, laughed, and fretted with ya’ll and I feel like you’re family.  This work just gives me hope. 🫶
The mental load podcast (329) is life changing! I started listening to this 3 years ago. It's now my go to podcast. As a woman, wife, daughter, and mother to a young child born in the pandemic, I was initially just looking to listen to a chat with the kind of wise, super smart woman who I love to count as friends. Each episode is exactly that and more. It teaches me, makes me think differently, with a good laugh along the way.  And episode 329 on mental load is GOLD. It hit all of the giant nails on the head. I literally thought I was the only one feeling this way! It gave me TOOLS to create change in my life. I immediately shared it with my husband, best friend, and a niece who is getting married.   Heartfelt thanks to Abby, Glennon, and Sister for doing the hard work and hard things that are so essential to change our world, especially right now.
Thank you!!! I applaud your decision to not just go along and pretend not to see what you are seeing. Great episode with Jessica Yellin.   THANK YOU!
Great podcast! So much honesty, hard discussion and immense learning. Thank you!
A-men to the Jessica Yellin Episode This conversation was so honest, clear-eyed and reaffirming to hear. Thank you! I would take the chance of chaos over this maddeningly losing strategy of fear-driven inertia anyday. (And have already written all my representatives to that effect.) A former boss of mine (a titan in the advertising world) once said, “Sometimes you have to throw the tiller hard over and just see what happens.”   Longtime listener. Love the pod’. Keep it up and thanks again for “getting political” - backlash be damned! :)
Really appreciate the Yellin episode I’m overwhelmed by the state of our politics, yet I felt a little less so after I listened to you all thrash it around for a while. I subscribed to Jessica’s newsletter and really appreciate her clear, rational takes.
Yellin Episode Dear friends,  Amanda for President!  Thanks for all you do!  XX Michele
Democrats dysfunctional family Your metaphor nailed it!  I’m as angry as you are about grandpa Biden refusing to give up the car keys when he can’t keep his eyes on the road ahead.  Your show consistently nails what you’re addressing. I’m an old white guy and a grandfather who regularly suggests your shows to my daughters. I love your courage, humor, intelligence and integrity.  Keep growing.
Everyone needs this podcast! I listen to all of your episodes and share with my mum and husband - it spans genders and generations. Only thing I wish- you’d play tish’s song every episode! Brings me to joyful tears
Biden I loved the discussion on Biden.  More like this!
Always thoughtful I’m a regular listener of this podcast and love it. I may not agree with everything they said in the most recent episode (about the President), but I thought it was a very thoughtful discussion.
Biden episode I normally love your podcast. However, while  I agree that it’s important to talk about this stuff, I’m VERY VERY frustrated that no one is talking about the really important part - the logistics of whether replacing him on the ballot is even possible. Every state has different laws on this. The primary decides the candidate on the state ballots, not the convention. State laws control how, and even if, a candidate can be replaced after the primary. And they are all different. For example, Wisconsin’s statutes appear to preclude replacing a candidate unless they die. The convention is a formality and has been since the 1970s. In fact, by the time the convention rolls around, the deadline for getting on the ballot in some states is already passed. This is just scratching the surface of the logistical challenges of changing candidates at this point. Talking about changing my candidates without talking about this is irresponsible in my opinion. Please do better. This is too important.
Gratitude When I hear the opening music my whole body instantly relaxes. It has helped me through so much and made me feel normal and not alone. I am extremely grateful for this podcast!!!
Stop the Biden hate Thank you
Thank you for episode with Jessica Y Episode with Jessica Yellin was informative and important. I appreciate your energy on this crucial situation. Onward.
Faith in Democracy! Thank you!  I appreciate this podcast so much. So needed to hear grownups talking about our current state of  democracy.  Thank you!!
Everyone needs this podcast I have made it my mission to tell as many people about this podcast as I can. It is amazing. The ADHD episode was the first episode I listened to. And since then I’m on my 25+ episode. I’m hooked. The questions, the conversations, the responses, the honesty, the vulnerability, I could go on and on, but it’s refreshing and allows me to be unapologetically myself with confidence. Love this podcast.
Adult bucket vs. love bucket This is an incredibly helpful way to drill down tasks and actions within a relationship. Thank you!!! This language will become part of my household.
Beautiful conversations! Such a treat to have your insights accompany me on walks, drives, and hikes! That said, certain episodes merit a dedicated listen with an appropriate beverage based on the time of day :-). Thank you for your candid, inviting conversations!
Always excellent AND episode 324 with Resmaa was best yet.  Re-listening required.
Diagnosis Thank you Amanda for sharing your cancer story. It is still so big and scary-raw and overwhelming. I was diagnosed 41/2 years ago with ovarian cancer. You have my prayers and support for what you have shared. You are doing what you need to do.  I love what you three do on this podcast. My 29 year old daughter shared you with me. Timeless- I am 56 and still growing.  Katchannel1 on instagram if you need a conversation. I would love to do an episode with you as a more mature woman living with cancer
Mind blown I listened to Episode 258, Why Can't I Love Myself? Abby hit everything I ever felt inside. I identify with her life experiences and it's so refreshing to have someone you've always admired be so open and vulnerable. I felt like she was speaking my thoughts and  emotions and she was raw and ... I am sort of speechless. Mind blown.  Thank you Abby and Gleenon for being willing to talk about the hard stuff and creating a safe space for those of us in a similar boat to finally feel our feeling and validate them.
Always, every time, share-worthy! I was introduced to We Can Do Hard Things podcast by my adult niece I think two years ago now… She shared with me, I have shared countless episodes with friends and family members… And what I love is my niece and a few friends we are so dedicated to, drawn to greater understanding of ourselves, of other humans, this world around us… And barely a two week  goes by where one of us is saying oh, did you listen to this episode today?? You gotta listen to this one!! Thank you… Thank you… Wise beings, sharing your human experience and learnings with all of us and helping us with our remembering and our  linking the dots together that we may continuously gain greater understanding and for me, greater peace in myself, and in my life as a result. Of course, never without challenges, right? 😁
Like a hug you can hear What a gift this show is!! So many perspectives and great community! Now we just need an episode that addresses our current political climate and practical steps to be sure we’re prepared as direct targets of the project 2025 agenda.   Thanks for all you do folks! Amanda, sending you healing vibes and as much peace as is currently possible♥️🧡💛💚💙
Episode was on point This episode about being the mom who does all the things and goes unnoticed. Takes all the pictures but appears in next to none. That used to be me. Now I make it a point to still take all the pictures but my daughter and I selfie all the time. Or I have no problem asking a stranger to take a picture of us. This episode really hit and I basically agreed with it all. I want to have a partner who will take those candid n the moment pictures of me.
Nurturing Thank you for all the wholesome comfort you bring each episode. You always remind me that it’s effective to pay attention to the things that make me feel crazy and then decide how much further attention to give and a plan of action. That’s not always easy and has gotten better with support and ideas from you, the community, and my personal journey. Thank you X a million. It means the world to have access to such incredible moral nourishment and empowerment. ❤️  My tips for change from the recent sleep episode: meditate during day, play more: NYT games, change algorithms w/baby highlands cows & puppy yoga 😅 I love it! Thank you for all you do.
Getting a better outlook on life My true crime binge was really hurting my mental health and darkening my view of humanity. This podcast is the opposite of that. Phew!
Always a revelation! Y’all have an uncanny way of getting into my brain/heart/soul & breaking it open instead of giving into the shutdown/wall-building I’m prone to.  I’m a 40 year old trans guy trying to raise 3 teens/young adults and I just…WHEW!!! My nervous system would not be doing as well in this world if I didn’t have y’all as long-distance-parasocial family.   Thanks so much for all you do! All of it. Sharing your adorkable quirks, thoughts, love, amazing guests, and all the things I can’t remember right now. And thank y’all for understanding that too! Soooo much love to all of you magical, magnificent mamas!
My favorite one (and I LOVE podcasts) I turn to different forms of media depending on how I feel. If I want to learn and grow, I might listen to one podcast, if I want to laugh or I’m feeling really tender, I might listen to another. I am a really sensitive person and the type of energy of the host and content of the show can really affect me. That’s the reason that this is my favorite podcast of all time – I can truly listen to it in any mood because it honors all of those parts of me. Glennon, Amanda and Abby are so funny - they can be talking about the most heart wrenching subject (that is also teaching me something) and somehow I will also come away laughing. It feels like these are three of your great friends who are also constantly inviting you to be better people, not through any pressure or scarcity, but in order to live your most true and beautiful life. I have literally listened to this show since day one. Thank you G, Sister, and Abby.
Important Episode - OCD Can’t thank you enough for your interview with Alegra Kastens about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I’m 41 years old and one of the few to be diagnosed quickly when I was 13 due to obvious physical compulsions; however, I’ve lived the majority of my adult life shame-ridden and masking to the world what felt like a misunderstood and an unacceptable mental illness. I’m just finally in a season of recovery that feels hopeful. This episode introduced a very important conversation to a mass audience, and it inspired me to share more with those in my own life. Thank you for all that this amazing podcast does to inspire, educate, and comfort those who listen.
Life Changing - TY ❤️ This podcast has helped me personnel with my own struggles & demons but also has taught me soooo much about others struggles. I’m forever grateful for all three of you.
Breast Cancer Screening Abby-Great suggestion. I sent texts to all my girlfriends and my sisters. Thank you Amanda for courageously sharing your very personal journey. Thank you Dr. Brem for education. Whew. One of the best pods so far.
Love this podcast! This podcast is so insightful and warm, even when talking about the “hard things.” I find so much solace in knowing that I’m not alone based off of your honest and vulnerable conversations. Thank you SO much!
Hooray Amanda Thank you for sharing your journey and the informational segment with Dr Brem.  So happy to hear  your “best “ news!  This episode fired me up to ask for tests that I need 💯
Healing happens here Thank you for all you share and for your vulnerability and honesty. It is making a tidal wave of an impact in so many people’s lives.
Thank You Thank you so much for helping me to understand through the episode with Prentis Hemphill about generational cycles and how we advertently push our own generational trauma onto our children and how it keeps repeating itself from generation to generation. I heard so much of myself, and the things that I did to my children in this podcast. As soon as I finished listening to it, I forwarded it to my three children who are all adults with their own lives, along with a written apology for passing along my generational trauma to them and for pushing it onto them. Thank you so much for opening my eyes and my heart so that I can be a transitional person and change this in my family.
Don’t know what I”d do without all of you. I have followed you G. Since I won a contest on your earliest “blog” for writing an essay about why I should win a box of Carry on Warrior and I won! I was so excited and I love that book just as much as UNTAMED in a. Different way! Praying for sister and her healing and thank you for living your fierce brave lives. Anna Van DIs in Durham NC
AMAZING I’m so beyond grateful for what y’all are doing. I’ve been able to parent myself in all the ways I hadn’t been growing up thanks to these podcasts.   And thanks to you all, I was able to figure out my mental health crisis was caused by OCD and get treatment. I can’t thank y’all enough. Thanks for helping to let the light back in🫶
Great interviews but challenging audio Really enjoyed the interview with Devon Price. It was a great group conversation. Several other episodes look great, but I can’t really follow with the audio volume varying so much and had to give up.
I love this podcast! This podcast is incredibly informative. I love the host. I love the guests - all the things!
What is Fun! Love this podcast!! As you all are walking through the journey of breast cancer, I love sisters courage and insight.  I recently walked this breast cancer path, as a family nurse practitioner when my provider called me, I was stunned to say the least…what I found to be some of the hardest parts was having past emotional and physical trauma’s impacted my healing.  Just when a person is thinking, I‘be got this… I‘be done my preparation and trauma work… to have it re emerge was humbling.
Thank you. Hits in the Feels As a woman & a psychologist I have been following your journey for some time. So many aspects resonate for me. I also use your journey, books, concepts, and the podcast in my work with women on their journeys!! Yes, we can do hard Things.
Baby Gay, Late in Life Lesbian I am so blown away by your words.  I have been an activist for over 20 years, but I only came out to myself and others last year.  Why?  Religious trauma.  Patriarchal societal trauma.  I cannot find the words when hate is in front of me.  Thank you for the words of healing and your words of strength.  I love you both.  Your love story has helped me see the Queer inside of me.
Thinking of Y’all Wishing for all the very best 🙏🏼(maSTECTomy)
Amanda’s surgery quick pronunciation note So helpful to all your listeners. I admit being a language stickler and no its not that important, but the word is MASTectomy not MASSectomy. I love the show and as a 66 yo Midwest Jewish lesbian its funny how I started with a crush on Abby and have become all in on Amanda! Wise witty and genuine. Thank you gals.
Born male at birth participating in girls and women’s sports. I listen to every episode and appreciate your perspectives and discussions related to hard things. Thank you for helping me mentally move the needle in my mind, actions, and words on many controversial issues.   As a 71 year old past competitive athlete, and still very active female in senior sport events please discuss on air this controversial issue.  Many of my athletic friends, young and old, are having difficulty accepting the legality of males born male competing in girls and women’s sports.   Transitioning, or not, is not the issue for us.  Born male.  Stay in your own lane. End of story.  Start an athletic division for these individuals?   Are we missing something in our non inclusive attitude regarding this subject?  This social issue is definitely one of my most challenging struggles.  Thank you for helping us by discussing this  very hard thing.
Worth every minute spent listening… …highly recommend!
What A Gift The show keeps me grounded, sane, and present in the brutiful challenges of life. What I love about this show is that whether I’m laughing or crying, or both, I am always learning and growing. I am a psychotherapist, and I share more episodes of this podcast than any other with my clients, as well as my friends and family. Don’t ever stop, doing what you are doing and being you.
Inaccurate information I would prefer to have addressed this to show host directly, but I cannot figure out how to do that. The information on episode two of the surgery very inaccurate and dangerous information. If your anesthesiologist gives you NPO instructions, it is not appropriate to ask your surgeon if you can not follow those. Amanda said that they told her she could not have coffee and she then asked for surgeon if that was OK. This is very dangerous and disrespectful of the anesthesiologist, which is to keep you alive and safe during surgery. The role is to operate, anesthesiologist role is to maintain physiologic stability and keep you alive.
No way to thank you enough After a near death experience I was gifted Untamed and haven’t touched the ground in the three years since it found me. The theory of finding your tree when you’re lost again struck lightning and new neural pathways even?! I love you Glennon and Abby and sister. I don’t return as often as I did but there’s only one pod squad for me. I am a different person, better… for your existing and work. Thank you a billion times a trillion times over. Godspeed!
therapeutic authenticity thank you for staying real, genuine & human. every flippin episode has so many “whoa!” moments, humor, & just reassurance about our imperfectness. grateful that the show and you still feel so intimate, private, comfy & real.
We Can Do Hard Things Wonderful show! Kind, wise and compassionate information to help manage the jagged edges in life.
Wow!!!! Thank you so much for this wonderful educational podcast. I’m learning so much from you wise ladies. I wish everyone listened to this podcast and learned how to be a human being. Love you all. Haleh from Crofton, Maryland
Amanda Dear Amanda,  I’m so sorry about your breast cancer diagnosis! I admire you for your kindness, compassion, wisdom and courage! I’m glad that your surgery went well, and I wish you will have a happy, healthy, long life despite this ordeal! I love you, Glennon and Abby! I’m very grateful for the podcast and the three of you!                               Huiping Xue
Jealousy podcast Thank you for this podcast. It opened my eyes and my heart to a new self dialogue and some tools. You both speaking honestly about it and how you are affected in your relationship by it was very healing to me.
This podcast is truly amazing Listening to Abby and Glennon’s podcast for the the first time today and it is truly wonderful. Thank y’all for sharing yourselves & your stories, much appreciated 🙏🏽
Sister’s diagnosis You gotta gotta hear these episodes about Amanda’s medical stuff, the ensuing dialogue is awesome . I completely resonate with G’s perspective on how it is some of us try to show love to our dearest ones.  It’s so easy for people to feel “ handled” or “ “managed “.   I really needed to hear this message .
We’re all ___er for having listened to this ✨ Smarter, softer, braver, more heartful-er?? All of the above. Please please just listen. I come to WCDHT like coming to a session with a great therapist or life coach. I don’t devour each episode as it appears. I move around it warily, do other things first, and finally click to proceed, pretty nervous and not having done my homework. But in the end I’m opened and alive. My favorite episodes are 215 with Andrea Gibson and 275 about birthdays, which NOT coincidentally was released ON my 40th f*ing birthday. I love these people, dis my pod squad.
14 years later… Glennon, Abby, thank you so much for creating this space. Just finished listening to the episode with Sloane sharing about her friend Russell. So many of your episodes have shown up in the space I needed at the time and this one is especially impactful. I lost my best friend 14 years ago. She was murdered by her boyfriend, who ended up taking his own life hours after. It was and is a reality I have a hard time facing most days, or feeling like I have a “right” to the loss. Hearing the conversation with Sloane brought me validation in feelings and thoughts I have had over many years. No therapist or book has hit me the way this has. It means so much to me and I thank you.
So relatable, funny, deep and down to earth. Listening to both of you was like being able to get so much confusion out of my mind and heart. I felt validated and not so crazy after all. Jealousy is such a delicate and hard topic for any couple, but it’s true that for lesbians, the boundaries are somehow fuzzy. Thank you so much for your candor. I loved this episode, it was my first time listening to you guys, but it won’t be the last. 🥰🥰🥰
Life changing and soul healing I’ve never felt so heard, seen, or held by strangers before. The concepts that you guys discuss feel universal, and yet I don’t know if I’ve ever been engaged in a conversation the way you guys do it. I start every Tuesday/Thursday listening to your voices and absorbing your guests like a sponge! lately I am loving the candid chats between Abby and Glennon!
My all time favorite podcast! Love the content and the feeling of community!
Thank you! I loved the conversation with Adrienne Maree Brown. I'm hooked and gonna listen to all the other episodes. Thank you!!!!
Thought provoking, raw, and vulnerable We can do hard things is a reality and challenge! It sets the stage by the vulnerability of the hosts sharing their own stories; the good, the bad, and the ugly, to encourage and move us into action in our own lives. Every episode is worth a listen!
This podcast is as helpful &cherished as therapy I’ve been listening since this podcast was released! Such important and healing conversations. I love every one in the pod squad! The episode with Reese gave me chills on a hot summer day. And made me tear up. Thank you, thank you, thank you for this podcast. I can’t say enough great things. ❤️
It’s just too self absorbed for me I’d like them to step more outside themselves.
Strangers turned Family I found this podcast during the hardest time of my life. My husband was having health issues due to addiction and I was home with my young son who did not understand what was going on. On top of that, I was keeping everything to myself to try and keep my husbands privacy. I looked to podcasts to help me cope with what I was going through. This podcast has really helped me reflect on my life and MYSELF. It’s hard to live a beautiful life, it takes lots of work. Finding a show that makes you feel like you are loved, worthy and uplifts you and push you to continue to do the things that need to be done has been life changing for me. Thank you Glennon, Abby, and Amanda for the many lessons that you have taught me and I wish you all the best. I will be praying for you and your family and a million thank yous forever💖
Thank you Glennon Just listened to today’s podcast. I am you. You are me. I have spent 90% of my almost 57 years doing exactly what you talked about today. I have struggled with eating disorders and codependency for years and felt “connected” to you from the moment  i first followed Momastery and read Love Warrior. As you grow - we all grow. Thank you for your honesty, and your vulnerability. Currently I’m reading Mother Hunger for my husband who just lost his narcissistic mother. I was plotting how to get him to read it until i listened today. I need to start reading for ME! lol! I have enough issues to deal with. I love walking this walk with you!! FYI - i work with new moms in the hospital learning to breastfeed and often tell them that they CAN do hard things. Mahalo - you are changing the WORLD! 🌎
Thank you Amanda for sharing🥹🩷 My 2 chosen sisters were diagnosed with the rare form of breast cancer 1.5 years apart. This path connected them in a loving and supportive way. Sharing your diagnosis with such fierce courage, authenticity, and clarity gave me a small glimpse into what my sisters may have went through. I know it touches each woman in different way, and the reality of recurrence for them is always a possibility.  I wish for every star to shine brightly on you and them, and to give you every ounce of energy and health you need to live your life. Sending you peace and love❤️
Amanda’s diagnosis and what has to change THANK YOU for this episode! I’m dealing with several people in my life who have issues they know about, that I have tried to help with and this episode has truly made me realize that it isn’t, nor should it be , my responsibility to solve. Particularly when these folks are not ready to h lo themselves,
Liberal politics I am so excited to listen to your podcast, that was until I heard your guest mention the dangerous orange man and immigration, yet it’s obvious you don’t actually care about legal immigration because the border is a mess. I am so sick of politics influencing mental health. Focus on helping without bringing your political beliefs.  You failed us. The people who desperately want help, you failed us. Stop being a victim. I am an Iranian American and yet I feel grateful to live in a FREE country. That doesn’t make me a white privileged supremacist. Your podcast is only separating us and creating hate.  Do you want to be a good humanitarian? How about trying to follow what you preach, inclusivity to ALL. That includes the Jesus followers, the we the people, the dems, the rich, the poor, the fat, the fit, the independents, the codependents, etc  Your inclusivity is fake.
Thank you Hi thanks for having Dr Schwartz on. When Amanda said she felt like she was faking I could relate.I believe my brain gets impatient so it provides an answer . Amanda I am sorry you are going through this.
My dear girlfriends… Oh, to be alive in the time of Abby, Amanda and Glennon. It’s as if you’re sitting at my kitchen table and saying and asking and responding to your guests as if it were me…total divinity! I just listened to Devon Price, also a new BFF, and how is it possible for someone that young to be light years ahead in their evolution!?! Brilliant! (Pssst Abby), my (highly productive) spouse has ALSO been right all of these years about naps, rests while I (Pssst Glennon) flit about with bulging self-righteousness for not stopping, denying myself a break because I may die if I stop. W.t.f. Ok, Devon solved that for us 🙏🙏🙏🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 for having him on your show! When I listen I always seem to hear exactly what I need to on any given day. Did I mention I love you all? 💓 Peace, sisters
Amazed Wow, I just have to say as a fellow breast cancer survivor who took breast cancer into my own hands (literally), as you did too Amanda, and saved my own life, as you are doing this episode really hit home. Please keep talking about how to help other women advocate for themselves. Coming from a daughter of a Mom who was too ashamed/embarassed to take care of herself enough to fight this stupid disease, and diagnosed way too late for any treatment, I would just want everyone to know it doesn’t have to be like that. I now live my life as a 45 year old daughter without a Mom, and my kids don’t have her as a grandma and it’s heartbreaking knowing we could have helped her through it all, if only she had just been able to take it into her own hands and take care of herself the way she took care of everyone else. I love all of you and I am so thankful you are talking about this. I hate that you’re going through it Amanda, and I am sending all the good thoughts your way. I know you have an amazing support system, but I also know how it feels to not be able to know how to deal with this within yourself…❤️
Sister Sister is the best and makes this pod what it is - her strength, humor, intelligence, and vulnerability all  balance out G and Abby.  Love to you Sister. You are doing really hard things and the squad has your back. ❤️  During the pandemic this pod was a lifesaver. It wasn’t like anything else. It’s not as good as it once was though. 3 hosts is too many. It was better when Abby was an occasional visitor to the pod. It was better when you had on guests and tackled tough topics and let the guests talk  more without interrupting.   It’s still a good pod and I hope that it’s just going through a slump and will come back stronger.  Love to all
Love! Love! Love! You All! & huge thanks!!! I love your podcast and all that you explore and expose about the messiness of life. I deeply appreciate all the solutions that you or your guests provide!! Sometimes I think I was at a therapy session. ❤️.
Amanda <3 How is Amanda this wise and eloquent? Listening to pt 2 and just feeling the deepness of this experience. So grateful for your words, Amanda. Take such good care. You are not alone.
One-Way Doors I feel less alone. Thank you for being so completely, fingers-on-the-pulse, open and vulnerable as you go through this.
Episode 309 Love your Pod Cast….Thank you for helping us all know, ‘We CAN do HARD Things’ sometimes we need pick our version of hard!  Sister/Amanda,  Thank you for sharing your story with such candidness, grace, honesty, and putting words to the truth, about the fact that, ‘no one but the person going through this truly understands it.’ Loved your sons comment, my son had a similar response when I got my diagnosis 6 years ago! Keep living, educating and asking the hard questions.  Bless you…Keeping you and your family in my thoughts and prayers!  Thank you! You all rock!   Kathy P
💙 Amanda Sending so much love to you and those who love you. Can’t imagine this pod or this world without you.
Breast Cancer Episode Thank you for doing this episode and being so vulnerable. I have the CHEK2 gene mutation, and have extreme amounts of fibrograndular breast tissue. I want to take them off, but my cancer dr says CHEK2 isn’t like BRCA. It’s true CHEK2 is more rare, and there is a way less data on it… but, am I also in charge of my body? My brain/anxiety needs? I’ve already had the thyroid cancer, great aunt(thyroid and BC), Grandma(thyroid and BC), mom(thyroid and glioblastoma).  Thank you for letting me know that our body decisions are ok. My thoughts after this are, I need a second opinion. Thank you for this!
Authenticity for the win! This podcast is often rehashed with my friends. It is so relatable and makes me feel less alone in my struggle.
May 14, 2024 episode WOW Great episode, thank you so much! Really needed to hear your positivity on this subject!
Love you 😍 Hi Amanda, please check out Dr jack Kruse. He talks about sunshine exposure, reducing blue light, and EMF exposure. I just know from my gut this’ll be very helpful to you. Blessings,
Sisters diagnosis Thank you so much for this episode! I am one of the 1 in 10 with extremely dense breasts. I had been getting 3D mammograms since I was 35. I asked my doctor if I should be getting ultrasound or MRI since I got a letter saying I was dense. He said no, because I had no family history. Fast forward to when I’m 42 in April 2022, (6 mos after I had a clear mammo) and I find a lump. I get an ultrasound and it shows one tumor. I get an MRI and it shows 2, all in one breast. The mammo I had to diagnose still didn’t show anything. I was stage 1, but had to have 4 mos of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation. I have been telling all women that I come in contact when about this and how they need to advocate for themselves. Thank you so much for this episode. ~ Maureen
Amanda’s Breast Cancer episode First, let me say all of you are in my heart.  In 2018 I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I also have “dense” breast tissue but not the same as yours.  Still, I faithfully went for my mammograms every year. In 2018 it turned out positive.  The amount of emotions I had were crazy. Happiness I caught it early, anger, fear, sadness, and even curiosity.  I went through lumpectomy, radiation, and chemo and six years later I am cancer free. I ended up writing a book because when I was first diagnosed, I wanted to read other peoples stories, but there were none out there. Everything was either a bunch of medical jargon or books that didn’t give the real emotion or the whole story.     I know you have a great support group, Amanda. Please lean on them! Your outcome sounds extremely positive that you’re still gonna need them.  Much love to all of you! Ruthie Lanigan
Prayers for Amanda ❤️❤️❤️ praying for Amanda! Thank you for sharing it’s going to help many people to be proactive about health!
SISTER!!!! Amanda, you are a sister to us all. My heart is heavy we are sending you strength hugs and all the love.
💖 We love you, Amanda. My mother was just treated for breast cancer and things seem fine for now. Wishing you the best!
Sending love to Amanda Love yall! Sending love and healing to Amanda and wishing her the best for recovery 🩷
The sisters everybody wants Funny. Smart. Illuminating.
I come here to honor and nourish my soul So many of the guests chosen to speak on this podcast are people whose wisdom I carry with me forever.
Episode 308 Brittany Griner! GREAT episode!!
Episode 302? 306? Chelsea Handler!! 2nd episode in April 2024 soooooooooooooooooo GOOD very wise, comforting, GREAT advice, REALISTIC advice and situations w/ people and strangers and society AND FUNNY-Especially w/ the way edibles makes a woke person feel 😭🤣 SO RELATABLE!! I love 💗 all of you ladies Tysm for sharing with the world 🌎
Proud Pod Squad member This remains my fave podcast. Regardless the guest or topic, it always to makes me feel more connected to and very less alone amidst my very human experience. Xx
My daily therapy At the recommendation of a dear friend, I binge-listened to this podcast from the beginning last fall and it immediately became my daily therapy. Because of the comfort and inspiration I found in this beautiful community of like-minded and like-feeling souls, I managed to escape a toxic job, toxic relationship and am feeling healthier than I ever have in my life. Thank you for this gift to the world!!
Exceptional I am so grateful for Glennon, Abby and Amanda’s commitment to have the tough conversations, be incredibly real about their experience and supplement their conversation with guests who share their commitment. There is so much good in here. Thank you.
Self-Care for the soul! After years of struggling with food, alcohol self-acceptance a friend recommended episode 272. Why Sober Life is the Luckiest Life with Laura McKowen. After an hour of listening to a captivating discussion, Glennon's quirky voice, Abby's infectious laugh, as well as, some hard truths, I felt like I found my people!  I am working through the episodes with Lindsay Gibson and WOW. They have already helped me understand and release anger towards my emotionally immature mother.  I feel so validated and my life finally makes sense. I am actually NOT the problem.   The Glennon, Abby and Amanda thank you!! You truly make every topic feel obvious, yet completely mind-blowing.
Ep. 306 OCD: BRAVE POD SQUAD! SPOT ON!! I have OCD and am in recovery after doing ERP therapy. This episode IS AMAZING!!! Mandatory listening for everyone haha!  I think it will really help people, and I feel very validated. Thank you pod squad and Alegra!
Love I learn so much from this show. Life is hard and this crew and their guests give me hope and ideas, new ways of thinking about things. Thanks, Amanda, Glennon and Abby ❤️
OCD Episode 10/10 I am a huge fan of this entire podcast but wanted to send a special shout out to the episode on OCD. I took abnormal psychology and a course specifically on the DSM in grad school and am shocked that I have never heard OCD explained this way. This episode should be required listening for all mental health related education. Thank you all for bringing this topic to light - it will save lives and get so many more people the help they deserve.
Eye opening and incredibly helpful! Thank you so, so much for this brilliant and incredibly informative episode! My eyes have been opened! My 10 yr old daughter has been struggling with anxiety for a couple of years, that we are aware of; and I feel it’s made a slow roll into OCD, or maybe it’s been OCD all along. I learned invaluable information from Allegra and I’m so grateful. I now have a basic understanding of what OCD is all about and how I can try to support my daughter; and I know now that we need to find someone who specializes in OCD. Making some calls today! Thank you, I can’t express how much this episode means to me! I’m in tears!
Grateful! Every episode leaves me with a smile, a few tears and a different perspective on how I see myself and the world around me. Thank you all for sharing your gifts with this world!! 💖
Always thought provoking This weekend I listened to Eps 300-301 (Fun!) and Ep 305 (self regulation and other stuff, not so fun). I was inspired to go watch Catherine Price’s Ted talk and Ted interview (she was the Fun Lady from EPS 300-301), because this idea of fun needed more reinforcement to sink in. Yes it was that hard to grasp. Mind-blowing to realize I’ve lost track of fun in my life. That being funny for others doesn’t equate to having fun always. I am intrigued at the concept of “fake fun”, and for me it is not social media but casual computer games that I waste time on and feel icky afterwards. So, thanks for giving me something to listen to through cooking lunch and then dinner, and probably changing my life for the better.
Helpful! Super helpful and insightful. The vocal fry is a little grating, but if you can get past it, there’s a lot of great information.
Life-Changing, Paradigm-Shifting All episodes, most recently the one on Internal Family Systems has legitimately changed my life. I thank you for your courage and intentionality in creating this show. I extend myself more acceptance and my family members more acceptance since listening. I am so grateful.
The Truth of OCD - just incredible The Truth of OCD was so spot on and similar to my story, I only wish I’d been able to listen 5 years ago when I had no idea what was happening to me and at my lowest point. Thank you for speaking so candidly and openly, this is eye opening and lifesaving information!! ❤️
we can do hard things This podcast has been a light for me in so many dark times. Even the episodes I don’t think I’ll relate to, I always leave filling fuller in my heart and lighter in my soul. Thank you so much, Glennon, Abby, and Amanda.
My Favorite! I absolutely couldn’t love this podcast more, unless, of course, I got to be in the room sharing space and conversation with these fine ladies.  Always an interesting guest and conversation. Always leaves me thinking and feeling so much. Many things resonate and hit what I’m thinking and feeling right now, others give me insights and ideas I hadn’t thought of.  I love each host even though understand Amanda the most. I see my past and current friends in Glennon and Abby, too. Always excited when a new episode drops.  I’m a better person because I listen.
Parenting episode My mom sent me this podcast, and she told me that I should listen to it. I wholeheartedly agree with most of the things that is being said in this podcast. As a mom who works full-time, runs a household, does all of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry, and who is also a full-time stay at home, mom. I find it really hard to get some time to myself. This podcast was relatable, and it made me understand that I’m not the only one who goes through tough times. It can be really difficult, mainly when you’re doing everything on your own. I have another baby on the way, and the one thing that I will say, is even though I’m married, and I have a daughter, and a house full of animals, I feel like I am so lonely. The fact that they touched base on those feelings in this podcast, meant a lot to me. The loneliness is so underestimated, and the loneliness isn’t for lack of being around people, it’s for the lack of those people not understanding your day to day. As I sit here writing this review, my 2 1/2 year-old daughter is screaming in the backseat. Even though it’s hard, I wouldn’t replace it for anything in the world.
Basic moms having revelations A podcast where middle-aged suburban moms discover that anxiety as an identity, touting their children to 10,000 extracurriculars, spreadsheets for the extracurriculars, and micromanaging everyone around them does not bring fulfillment. Every episode it’s a shock !!
Grateful to be alongside So thankful for these women, doing the hard work and sharing what they learn as they go so we can learn from them and in turn be inspired to do our own work. The world is better because you are here doing this job❤️There are days when you are the exact friends I need and no one else could do that job.
Like a punch in my soft tummy I’ve loved and consumed the works of Glennon since the very beginning. But in the last several years I’ve been learning more and more about antiracism and I thought Glennon was too. I felt so much less alone listening to her words. I trusted her. However her words and actions no longer align and I can no longer align myself with her. She chose to have Chelsea Handler a genocide supporting Zionist on the show recently. What a punch in the soft tummy. What a betrayal and a perpetuation of white supremacy. I am so so so crushed.
Hypocrites I am so so so so disappointed in you all.  I don’t know how you ever thought it was appropriate right now to have Chelsea Hanlder again on your show.  I look forward to your podcasts biweekly and listen to every one of them but this just stopped me in my tracks.  I always recommend your podcast saying it’s not another podcast of white privileged women talking about shallow things.  Yet here you are, giving Chelsea Handler time AGAIN on your show.  Where is your support this week of all the children and families dying and traumatized in Gaza?  Is too inconvenient to stand by your supposed convictions when you can have a Zionist celebrity on your show?  Really Ladies?  Really?  I always thought you were better than this and had such a beautiful moral compass.  You’ve lost me as a listener and I will apologize to my friends and tell them that you actually are a privileged group of white women who stand up for justice only when it is convenient for them. What breaks my heart is not that you had her on your show again, but that I thought you were all so much better than this and stood for something that gave me so much hope.  Who next will you share your platform with, Trump?
Just getting started and hooked! I read Untamed and had to get more nuggets of wisdom from Glennon, and now love listening to all three of you! Such incredible guests and I feel cracked open and empowered after each listen. Especially loved the episode with Devon Price & Richard Schwartz. Will you please have Dr. Jon Connelly, founder of Rapid Resolution Therapy on as a guest?! His work is absolutely groundbreaking and life changing!
ADHD That episode got me. Hard. I’m on my third episode now and I think I’ll be here for a while. Thank you for bringing all these conversations to us. Even when I’m not 100% in agreement, each podcast so far has opened my eyes and mind to new ways of seeing the world and functioning in it while also validating things I didn’t even know I wanted validation on. Thinking about each ep and discussing them has already provided new opportunities for self-appreciation and self-awareness, and you can’t live a good life without that.
Don’t miss an episode… EVER! This podcast means SO much to me— which is why I just shared it with a friend and am leaving a review because this show deserves it!  ❤️ This podcast has helped me grow in so many ways, I am so thankful for this community of people who are out there trying to make themselves and by proxy the world a better place!  Keep fightin’ the good fight pod squad!
Love y’all The interview with Chelsea Handler was fantastic!!!! You all are the best and I appreciate all of your hard work. Just the whole thing is wonderful. And “funner” as Chelsea dubbed it.
The Perfect Alchemy Glennon tells us we’re real. Amanda makes us feel safe. And Abby tells us we matter. Y’all are incredible separately, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts! Thank you for your time, your brains and your hearts.
So real. So true. So funny. So helpful. So needed. Thank you 🥲 This podcast is changing my world for the better. It is saving me. I can’t thank you enough.  (Insert tears of joy, realization, hope, self-love, and so much more ❤️)
This show is so real 🤩 I love how down to earth and relatable these ladies are and their discussions. It’s like practical girl talk 101 and I love it! Along with being real comes going deep and they all do that perfectly well. Bravo. I love this show and it’s various topics.  💗Cristal from Austin
I love yall, but… Chelsea Handler is a genocide supporter who actively spreads pink-washing lies about Israel to pander to our queer community and justify the 14,000 dead kids. We aren’t interested in anything she has to say unless it’s an apology.
Chelsea Handler I have decided that Chelsea Handler needs to be my life coach. I don’t have a passport!!
A platform for hate Giving a platform to Chelsea Handle, a pro-genocide Zionist actively promoting the colonization and ethnic cleansing of Palestine through a robust public disinformation campaign, is so gross. You shouldn’t do that…for very obvious reasons. Didn’t realize this podcast was so tolerant of blatant white supremacy.
what?? chelsea handler is a zionist and a racist who has repeatedly publicly ignored and dismissed the slaughter of the thousands of palestinians who are experiencing an ongoing genocide. why are you featuring her on your show?
Chelsea Handler? Hard pass: she is a racist, pro genocide, pro apartheid mess of a human. I find it very sad that you give her a platform.
I cannot stop!! My friend told me about this show yesterday, and I looked it up thinking I’d listen to 15 minutes of an episode and then move on. Instead I was sucked into 4 straight episodes, listening while I was working, running, even grocery shopping. I was in the middle of Whole Foods listening to Glennon recount her ESPYs duck story crying laughing in front of the bell pepper display and was getting strange looks from everyone around me. I cannot wait to continue to learn and laugh through the archives and the new episodes as the come out. I can already tell that this show is going to help ground me in the tumultuous few years I’ve had when nothing else has succeeded. Thank you!!
LOVE I LOVE listening to your show! It has been helping me so much with navigating parenting a toddler, my relationships (with myself and others), and just gives me a lift every time I hear all of your voices. Your guests are amazing! Especially love the Liz Gilbert pods, all of the Dr Becky pods and the recent IFS series with Richard Schwartz! WOW!! The work and the wisdom is revelatory and so comforting!!! THANK YOU, Glennon, Abby & Amanda!!! ❤️❤️❤️
No better way to ‘grow up’ and become a better person I cannot think of a better way to learn or relearn the qualities needed to live an exceptional life on this earth than listening to the We Can Do Hard Things podcast. Glennon, Abby, and Sister tackle the topics needed to be a kind, loving, and accountable human being. They are like the awesome big sister I never had, giving me the best advice that I didn’t learn growing up. Listening to and being part of their ‘pod squad’ is a shelter from the harshness of life that beckons “come sweet girl, have a seat and listen and learn~ you are 100% OK for the next hour and for all the hours after that…..”
Pod Squad Fan Girl It’s hard to properly articulate how much of an impact this podcast has had on my life. I have unraveled and discovered parts of me that had long been tightly bound and shushed into dark corners. I have been awestruck, delighted, and profoundly moved. I regularly cry, laugh, and have the distinct feeling that I’m hanging out with people who know my soul and honor it. I has helped me to create positive and transformative change in my marriage, has made me a better parent, and has given me courage to be bold and direct at work. I have never really been a fan girl of anything, and I can rarely get through a meaningful conversation where I don’t reference it at least a few times 😂 Thank you Glennon, Amanda, and Abby, making me feel so seen and understood.
Words don’t do it justice I can’t put into words how much I LOVE this podcast and am so eager to listen to every episode. Nearly every episode I am gasping, identifying, learning new things, and LOLing the whole time. It is the best combination of depth and groundedness and sprinkled with humor. THANK YOU Glennon, Abby, and sister for being so real and amazing!!! I heal a little more every time I listen 🩷🩷🩷
Thank you. Don't ever stop choosing the hard topics.
hands down my fav pod Devoted podsquader. You ladies make me laugh and cry every episode, sometimes I laugh so hard that I cry. Thanks for being vulnerable and for embodying truth. You show up every episode with raw authenticity. Abby I love your ennegram 7ness and energy. Glennon, I love your creative wordplay and ability to stay open & honest with yourself  through your healing journey. Amanda, your solo episode after the overturning of Roe v. Wade gave me goosebumps, you have a way of saying things that would make armies of women from all over the world follow you anywhere. Thank you for what you do. This podcast is life shifting and so impactful for me and those I’ve shared it with. Each of your letters to Love moved me so much. I’ve asked my yoga students to do them with me.   Namaste Awkward, Brave, & Kind.
It’s never too late to come alive! (Again) I am 72. I am invisible most of the time and no one is around to hear my outbursts of laughter and gut wrenching guffaws as I wander around my space. Listening to Abby, Glennon, Amanda and their podcasters has given me my first glimpse of digital life as a place for intimacy. If you’re lonely, connect with “the girls”, I think, as I grab my earbuds and join the rooms. I have always valued my female relationships highly. I have deeply felt loss over the deaths of the “BFFs” from my beginnings. The girlfriends of our past lives swirling in my memories.  My haven is a bird sanctuary, created over many seasons to capture the beauty and serenity that a small wildlife preserve offers to its willing worshippers. I also paint flowing colors of all the colors randomly following a course on the rock face! Those flowing rocks connect me to my dear ones, my sisters already gone with the Spirit. I feel the power of the sizzle in Nature.  Thank you all for being there when I was searching. Open to new ideas and suggestions. I love you as if I have known you all my life. “Donna cakes”(my Dad’s nickname for me) Aka Donna K Lake More later!
Home I want to live in an eco village with the pod.  Thank you
Gratitude! Gosh, I have loved this podcast for quite some time, but your latest show on parenting felt like maybe, just maybe, you all were speaking directly to me. The unique stories and reflections you all shared honestly have helped my healing journey as I navigate being a new mom going through a painful divorce. All I am seeking right now is strength and peace for me and my girls and hopefully the ability to truly let go of my fear and anger. Thank you all so much for contributing to that process today. Each of you are truly special lights in this universe!
Abby, Glennon, Amanda I GIVE YA’LL INFINITY/5 STARS OK❤️🌟 HI LOVLIESSSS!!!!❤️❤️ By the WAY I would love to leave you a little voice message/questions too as well after this but I am not sure how to do that yet but I will figure it out lol — either way, Hello Earth Angels sent straight from literal ABOVE, I am a loyal ride or die pod-squader, My name is Erin, I am from Pennsylvania, 25 yrs old👩🏽 staying in a house with my Corgi pup named “Kai” and working as a chiropractic assistant (usuless information but anyways😂) I just wanted to leave you ladies with a little love boop on the nose♥️🤏🏼and tell you that YOU ALL make me SO HAPPY SO GENUINELY HAPPY and also just feel so confidently and comfortably safe
Fantastic Show I am Dad of three, so it’s great to hear others share some the feelings I have on a daily basis when it comes to the uncertainty of raising children.  I listened the latest episode and I literally laughed and cried through out it.  It’s a great podcast and it is now one of my favorites.
Wed/April 10 Fav! I’m ok where I’m at (about to be 59) and I still wonder all the same things as Emma! Loved the pep talk- heard it
Every time I come away inspired! Pooja said no and it created a positive ripple effect! Also, my therapist asked me to write out my values and u had no idea what to do. It was so NICE to have it explained to me. Also, the timing was impeccable!
Life Changing Your work has changed my life. Simply finding your own paths has helped me get on mine. In weekly gratitude, Jenny
Great episode with Dr Schwartz. Thank you Thank you❤️
Changing All the Things! I stumbled upon this podcast just two weeks ago and listed to the IFS episodes. I have been in therapy for years and never heard of IFS. It’s revolutionized how I want to partake in therapy and as I start my journey to become a therapist as well. The vulnerability of Abby, Glennon, and sister to partake in therapy on a podcast was beautiful and I was able to work through so much of myself with them. Thank you! I’m a loyal listener now.
Love this show This show discusses topics I’ve pondered and often thought I was alone in my experience of. Thank you for making me feel seen.
Keep healing!!! Your healing work helps others heal! Thank you for what you do. Much love.
We not I Thank you for showing me how to walk with all my parts. If it wasn’t for you guys being vulnerable on the pod I wouldn’t have taken the time to care for myself or acknowledge I as a we. Love and much appreciation. 🩷❤️💙
IFS Episode was amazing This episode answered so many questions I’m having right now. I’ve been working on my parts in therapy but slowly with interruptions from talking about daily stressors and my therapist is new to IFS. This show really brought it together for me, I feel a deeper understanding of myself and like I understand much more fully hope to dive into this work. Thank you 💚
Always insightful I am obsessed with the birthday episode and really all of them. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability.
Courageous Thank you for advocating for the humanity of ALL people without apology or fear. Keep going ❤️
Amazing IFS Episodes Brilliant! Tears of love, joy and gratitude.  Dr. Schwartz is awesome BUT the three of you are Rock Stars for doing hard things for real!  Simply amazing!
Gone downhill I used to never miss an episode. Now it’s become a therapy session for the hosts and I find myself skipping half the episodes. I hope they find their way back to interviewing interesting guests that serve a wider audience, not just their own issues.
Adore yall! I adore yall and listen to the show every day as I get ready for work (middle school teacher). I just listened to the Dr. Ford debrief and just had to say I LOVE with Sister goes off and the F word abounds. Thanks for everything yall do!
Where Real Life Happens I am 65 year old retired male and this is the first podcast I have listened to in my life and it has been epic in my life for insights and ongoing growth. I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame and only after the fact did I know why.  I loved the episode where Abby asks why can’t she love herself? Shot directly to my heart! I recognized myself in what she said and it woke me up in a way that I needed. Also, I fell in love with her as a person for her vulnerability and candor. I feel like if I could open up more like that and be that intimate, I would truly love myself in ways I only dreamed about. It’s now a path among many for me as well. When are you going to follow up that episode?  And how about Alok who said “ And what my gender journey was about is less about finding my gender and more about being able to walk on the earth and feel it, being able to speak with a kind of conviction where my words actually landed. How I got there is what other people call gender, but what I call healing myself.” I felt that deeply and it moved me.  Also, Thank you for putting the transcripts on your website because I prefer to read them so when I read something important, I can stop, reread and ponder things for a bit also know as savoring.  This is important work that you do. It is making a real positive difference. And the fact that it’s hard makes it more impactful in my case. Thank you so much!!!!
A Must-Listen!!! I LOVE THESE LADIES!!! I feel like I’m listening to friends - the most highly evolved, empathetic, inclusive, caring friends I could ever have. I have learned soooo much from this trio and their guests. I never miss an episode.
LoveLove love Love the honesty, courage and truth-seeking behind each episode!  You guys are healing so many lives!  Thank you thank you thank you!!!  Sona
ADHD I’m a 32 year old that was recently diagnosed with ADHD. So much confusion and grief around it and how to explain how my brain is working that this episode was a blessing for me. I have never felt so so understood and seen.  THANK YOU doesn’t even cover it. Thank you for reminding me that I’m not broken and there’s nothing wrong with me. I shared it with my husband in hopes that we can start learning TOGETHER! Y’all are out here doing Gods work. Thank you again. 💕
Sharing life’s journey with joy, compassion, and insight You guys are talking about the good stuff! I love putting on your podcast and finding something there that I want or need to focus on… whether I realized it before it came on or not.  Across the board, your authenticity, humility, and empathy help me engage with sometimes heavy ideas in a productive and enjoyable way.
Love love love I absolutely love this podcast. It’s my all-time favorite. I learn something new every episode and without saying a word, I feel heard and understood. What a brilliant and brave group of souls!!
Love this POD!!! But.. I have been a major fan of Glennon and Abby for years. And I LOVE this pod and the value it brings to the soul and to the mind. But… sometimes I find it difficult to follow, as there are guests that come on and the conversation flow is as if we already understand the topic. They use acronyms as if the viewer read the book of the guest and already knows what will be discussed(the highly sensitives episode).   This pod has always been a safe space to learn, and reflect. It still is! But sometimes I wish there was a different language used directed towards the audience so we can all be in the loop(:
Growing, Learning and LOVING! This Podcast helps me keep a focus on the things that matter! I listen and LEARN on every episode. On nearly every episode, I have a big “ah-ha” moment and/or I learn something entirely new. Recently, I am loving the episodes with Lindsay Gibson and On Highly Sensitive People. What is so wonderful and powerful about each episode is how the three of you tell your own stories and how your life experiences relate to  all concepts of the episode theme/topic. This is indeed your “secret sauce” because it demonstrates your truthfulness and thoughtfulness! . Thank you for producing a fabulous podcast that always keeps me engaged, inspired and yearning for more!!  I also know you are a “women owned” business and in honor of WO3 day, a Grassroots effort to promote and support small women-led businesses, I am writing you this testimonial today on WO3 Day to support you and your mission to be truth-tellers and helping each of us understand this “bru-ti-ful life” (wo3connect.com or @WO3connect) Thank you and much appreciation to Glennon, Abby and Amanda and Bravo on all your contributions to inspire and educate us all to keep learning, growing and loving!
Gabrielle Blair I think it would be illuminating if you guys had a podcast episode where you invited Gabrielle Blair (@designmom) on to discuss her book ‘Ejaculate Responsibily’. She offers up some progressive-paradigm-shifting bullets points on…for lack of a better way to say it...how to ejaculate more responsibly. With th advent of SCOTUS ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and the impending election this year I think it is more relevant than ever.  Love you guys, look forward to listening to you every week.  Xo Kiley
Great interview with Roxanne Gay Listened to your 11/21/23 interview with Roxanne Gay. ❤️❤️❤️
I Gained So Much Insight from What ADHD Feels Like I can’t thank you enough for delving into the topic of being neurodivergent and queer in a neuro normative world.  My wife has ADHD and Jaklin made me realize that life is very challenging for her and that I need to be more patient and less critical when I am annoyed by her hyper focus on work, problems with time management, her messiness, and all of the things that are not done or half done or not done to my standards.  Your show helped me to understand all of her strengths amongst her struggles.  I love your show and am grateful to you all for your skill in addressing the hard things in life with compassion, grace, kindness, intelligence, integrity and humor.
A special place for special people This podcast means a lot to me. It makes me feel stronger and softer. I share it with my parents, especially my mother. It helps me access my soul. I am better for it’s existence. Especially when ALOK is on 💖
Absolutely Obsessed! I read Untamed a few years ago and a lot of the things said in the book stuck with me this far. I was listening to Jennette McCurdy’s podcast Hard Feelings and heard an ad for this podcast and was OVER THE MOON to hear that Glennon has a podcast now! This podcast helps me feel so much more human in a way and makes me feel less alone in those struggles. Thank you guys so much for doing everything that you do!🫶🏼 10/10 recommend, will always love Glennon Doyle!
Good except for the ad & the questions Good convos. Loved the Katherine May, Lizzy G, Hannah Gadsby and Nadia Bolz-Weber interviews. The questions though…they are often so leading or so odd. The guests often come back well from it though. And the ads… are strange in a way that I can’t quite put my finger on. But I’ve changed my review to five stars because of the senseless hateful reviews on here.
Standing Together Deepest thanks for a conversation that sparked hope & awe in the possibility of peace. Sally Abed & Alon Lee Green opened my eyes to new conversations & explained the viewpoints of both Israeli & Palestinian people- the desperate need to write a new story together. This podcast is powerful, emotional, & hopeful . If we say we can do hard things- we must stay curious & open to hear what Standing Together shares. Thank you G & Sister for the delicate way you enabled this conversation to grow. Peace to us All! Fan
Standing Together episode Thank you so much for dedicating an episode to the struggle of the Palestinians. I know you will inevitably receive quite a bit of misdirected backlash for this episode, which I’m sorry for. As a Palestinian American and avid listener of your show I am so grateful that you have invited guests who have shed light on the situation not only in Gaza, but in Israel and Occupied Palestine, from a point of view outside of the incredibly biased mainstream US news. The terrible mistreatment of Palestinians has been largely ignored in the mainstream west for decades - and has made those of us who are members of the Palestinian diaspora feel quite isolated and gaslight by the media in the US - and I am so so thankful for figures such as yourselves for using your platform to provide heart-centered, intelligent insight and education to your audience members who truly may not know the details of the injustices that are US funded occurring in Israel against Palestinians.   I love all of your episodes, I connect with them so deeply (especially as an enneagram 4 ☺️) and your support of organizations such as Standing Together completely confirms for me that you all have hearts of gold ❤️
Very disappointed I used to be obsessed, and I feel a bit heartbroken. I’m uncomfortable with more recent episodes. I feel like this podcast has turned into Glennon worship. Recent talk about Together Rising has made it sound like Glennon started the charity by herself. I don’t love the idea of an HBO show about her. Now she’s promoting her daughter’s EP. This all feels a little self-aggrandizing. More disturbing, I don’t like the way Glennon celebrates her depression. Many depressed people (and I am one of them) think at one time or another that their disease makes them special. That it makes them understand the world better. Glennon seems to believe she is just more sensitive and feeling — or better— than the rest of us. And that’s why she’s so sad. No. Depression is a disease and it kills. Please do not glamorize it or call it “godness”. Thoroughly enjoyed Glennon getting checked multiple times in the most recent Israel/palestine ep. Because she has the foreign policy and political views of a 16-year-old. She is simply unsmart. Certainly too dumb to ask intelligent questions of intelligent people.
Thank you I’m a new listener- listened to your Palestine and Israel episode. Thank you!!! I’m now eagerly looking and wanting to listen to all of your other episodes! A new refreshing favorite podcast I can get behind!
so many inaccuracies. unfollowing. the 'standing together' episode is full of so many inaccuracies. Essentially, you are furthering fake news, which is something you've previously been so against. it's really disgraceful. unfollowing.
Already shared with friends and family Very good.  My neighbor said “This is the most intelligent conversation she has ever heard about this conflict.”
So angry about I have listened to every episode since you launched the podcast. Loved and learned so much. But your last episode about the Israel Palestine conflict broke my heart. I don’t understand how a group of women who stand up for so many people could put out content that makes Jewish women feel so betrayed. Please read Night by Elie Wiesel or The Postcard by Anne Berest and then do a follow-up episode that addresses your Jewish audience with tenderness and compassion.
RESPECT None for you! Your thinly veiled antisemitism is shining brightly. Your ignorance of foreign policy is blinding.
Powerful Everyone should hear this episode. It is presented from both from a Palestinian and Israeli point of view and presents the most sensible point of view on this conflict that has been presented to date. And it offers up an important and cautionary message regarding the upcoming election in the  US.
Episode 292 is incredible Thank you for holding such an important public conversation with Alon-Lee and Sally Abed on the real steps that can bring peace to Israel and Palestine. I’m the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor and this is so needed.
Standing Together podcast Finally!!!! I have been waiting for you to talk with Standing Together about the horrific situation in Gaza. This was an excellent episode and so so key for all the activists here in the US to understand that although it is all interconnected, we MUST a stand with the Democratic Party if we have any chance of dismantling the system. Thank you, thank you!! 👏🏻
Gaza war Giving voice to anti-Zionists is a slap in the face of worldwide Jewish communities that support Zionism wholeheartedly. Repeatedly calling Israel a war criminal and not even touching on the impossible reality Israelis face with decades of nonstop barbaric terror, is blatantly putting Jews worldwide at risk and condoning the next massacre.   There are babies, kids, women and men still held by Hamas terrorists and being harbored by the Palestinian “civilians” in Gaza that only root stronger for their abhorrent leadership. Israel, by contrast, has steadily protested against Bibi for over a year.   Disgusting and shameful episode that promotes hatred.
Truth and Community I feel so grateful for these conversations. I’ve been a listener since the beginning, but today I am giving a review because of the incredible spotlight you’ve given to Standing Together. I listen to all kinds of intellectuals talk about the Middle East and none get to the heart of the matter like your guests did today. If everyone could truly hear their message, the world would be a better place. I appreciate the personal talks as well as the conversations around important global issues; all pointing towards a more loving, accepting, humane and mature way of relating to ourselves and one another. Thank you for speaking the truth, ❤️
Disappointed If you’re a Jewish don’t listen to this I was enjoying them for a few days and then realized they are antisemetic.
Lack of support I could cry over your lack of support for Israel and the hostages (including women and children) and the misinformation you are putting out. Such an unbelievable disappointment. I am so sad. Breaks my heart to have to unfollow this podcast and not listen anymore.
👍 👏 Thank you for the recent episode on Palestine and Israel.
Great 80% of the time! I really love this podcast and all these amazing women in it and who are guests on the show but I don’t love the political views that seem to come into play on quite a few episodes. I listen and started listening solely to have something empowering, calming, and thoughtful to listen to so I just really don’t enjoy listening to politics. I feel like they just don’t have a place in a podcast that’s about helping people and doing hard things because ultimately they are opinions and politics never brings joy to anyone ever. Other than that though it is a good podcast, just skip through the political opinions and talks.
Obsessed! Such great topics. You hear the growth in the hosts right before your ears. My favorite is the emotional maturity
Thanks Thank you love your podcast🥰
Signing me up for the vigilante! Signed me up for the vigilante!!!! Thank you for having the conversation with Dr. Ford ♥️
IVF Alabama ruling While I appreciate that you gave this issue another chance to be discussed, as someone who had gone through the incredibly hard thing of infertility, miscarriages, IVF, and an abnormal pregnancy- it would of been powerful to hear from someone with a first person view of the above. Our stories are  not shared enough or are just glossed over for the big world view. Some points in this episode were glossed over in the IVF process - specifically what happens when more embryos are created than can get used, and why families need as many opportunities as possible when going through infertility. And that is essentially what happened here - those that brought the court case had finished their families. And now the he irony is, they have succeeded and achieved pregnancy, but because of this “accident”, everyone had to pause their cycles and plans.
Epiphanies Galore I hear it in all of them, but Glennon in particular; in every guest episode, we witness an expansion of their knowing. You can hear it in their laughter, I love it so much. This is an incredible show.
The only podcast I listen to I’m not big into podcasts, but this one is worth it bc I am guaranteed to get something out of it every time…and most times I’m still thinking about it days later.
YES ABBY! “We come into this world alone, we leave this world alone, and I think in the middle, we are trying to convince ourselves that we aren’t actually, in fact, alone”
Love this podcast so much. Thank you for tackling hard things with us. So grateful for the work you do. Lots of love to all 3 of you!
We Can do Hard Things Love it!
Lost me when you went Pro-Palestinian / Hamas I have been such a fan of your podcast and it used to bring me such joy.  but I cannot continue to support you as you have not used your voice to speak up about 1) the brutal 10/7 attack by Hamas - the killing, the torture, the rape and mutilation of innocent Jews / Israelis 2) the urgency to bring the hostages home 3) the rampant antisemitism in this country and how ferried Jews are with all the hate.  Of course I am saddened by the plight of the Palestinians, but this is a Hamas issue more than an Israel issue, who is only fighting to defend herself and maintain a safe homeland for the Jewish people. When did you become so tone deaf? Incredibly disappointed!!
Profound Understanding The March 12 podcast just showed up on my IPad? I was having my morning coffee and decided to listen. Coincidence? I’ve not subscribed and had no idea about your podcasts.  I have struggled my entire life feeling something was “ miswired ” in my brain.  No one seemed to understand the gut wrenching pain I felt about others misfortunes, the environment, our democracy, abuse of animals, war, famine, ……..  Do I need to go on?  I could lead a corporation and make it work, I could not tolerate a family group with music and multiple conversations? I made everyone’s serious decisions but never felt a day of safety or peace in my own mind.  People considered me a “ worried soul”, “ a fanatic at times I suppose.  All the while I was the foundation for all in trouble.  The “ strong” one.  The risk taker, the one who could get things done.  Inside I hated myself and was crumbling mess. People marveled at my rising from the ashes, I felt I was an imposter.  I have sought mental health in the past with little or no relief. No one ever told me that this was not something I chose, a biological response to traumas or childhood responsibilities. I was “ broken”.  I just wanted to write ( I never do because I hate journaling, as it puts my pain on paper) to you with the deepest gratitude.  I am not broken, I am just me. Now I need to try to map a way of dealing with this fragile soul.  I pray it’s nit too late. If I could just find a few days if really being at peace with myself, that is all I ask.   Thank you from the bottom of my weary and cracked heart.
Disappointing but not surprised Once I saw how much hate you got from z i o s for donating to Palestinians I knew u wld cave.
10 Million Stars So honest, informative, will challenge your thinking, make you feel seen, open your mind and give you a warm hug all while laughing, crying and smiling with every single episode. I’m obsessed. And grateful.
Vital to our humanity and sanity Glennon, Abby and Sister show us the way to do the right hard things well. I have been avoiding all news for about two years now, and after listening to this episode with Jessica Yellin I am committing to re-engaging. I don’t want to, but I know how important it is to be part of the fight for human rights in this moment of history. Thank you for showing us the way!
Growing disappointment I loved this podcast in the beginning and listened to every episode. I so enjoyed the stories that Glennon, Abby and Amanda shared. Glennon’s book Untamed has a special place in my heart as it helped me when I was going through my separation and I have always felt like the podcast was kind of an extension of that with the added bonus of Abby and Amanda!!! However, the increasing amount of politics in the discussions especially the blatant hyperbole to the point of being misleading around reproductive issues on the most recent episode has completely put me off this podcast. I imagine it is only going to get worse with elections around the corner so I will be unfollowing for the time being. Maybe the discussions on partisan politics will die down eventually and I will be able to enjoy this podcast again.
Podcast is like a big warm hug with your best friends Glennon is always true to herself, be like Glennon. How do we empower our young girls to be like Glennon? Please don’t be upset of the negative ignorant comments on your ceasefire post. I love you ❤️  P.s. to all the comments saying she is pro terrorism and antisemitic. She called for a permanent ceasefire and sent food to starving children. If anything these hateful comments are making her more true to herself. I’m so proud of you cheetah.
Inspiring In a environment where authenticity is often overshadowed by hypocrisy, it’s disappointing to see many mental health advocates, life coaches and authors in mainstream media fail to live up to the same values the speak about. Abby and Glennon, however, have boldly uphold their values, offering a breath of fresh air with their genuine voices, experiences and commitment to justice. As a devoted fan of Untamed, hearing directly from Abby reinforces my admiration for her and reaffirms our shared values. 🙏🏽🩷
Disentangling from emotionally immature This is the third time I am writing a review for this podcast because this episode was GOLD! Life-changing! I have already shared it with 3 people, saved it, and will be listening again. Thank you to the team for your authenticity and vulnerability.
Love this pod! The work done here is so valuable. Anyone can find value in any bit of advice given in this podcast, whether it’s for yourself, or navigating the world of others. The only criticism I have is just a personal experience with all the constant “mmmmm” and “mhmm” sounds of the affirming and active listening style of the hosts is genuinely triggering for my sensory sensitivity issues. Again, that’s my own personal issue but may be helpful for others to know.
Losing me I just loved this podcast when it first came out. I pushed it on everyone I knew. But I’ve had a repeated icky feeling/reaction to many episodes over the past several months that feel so self indulgent - so much focus on the hosts’ own preoccupations and “inner journeys” for lack of a better term. While I am sure many find much with which to resonate in such episodes, it leaves me uncomfortable. Feels voyeuristic. Something has shifted and I preferred the outward facing explorations a lot more. Primer example is today’s episode w Glennon’s daughter and her musical producer.  It’s not enough to be in a position of such privilege to promote one’s daughter’s musical career, but to do so so unabashedly?  It’s hard to digest.
An Unforgettable Date with Andrea Gibson & Megan Falley. I laughed, I cried and smiled until my face hurt. I felt like I was in the same space with you all even though I was in my car, driving from New Jersey to Cape Cod.  The honesty, kindness and abundance of love permeated out through the airwaves and into my heart. Thank you! Oh and the poems~the poems~magic!!!
Painful I couldn’t get through one episode with all the mmms.  Her voice is painfully high.  Mmm.  Mmm.  She trying to seem empathetic, but it comes across as shallow and fake.
Not afraid to do hard things 🩷 I’ve been a huge fan of this pod from the start- always informative/ thought provoking. Good. am grateful that the team (Glennon, Abby and Amanda) for speaking up about the g3n0cide. In these times of cancel culture, so many are simply silent. But love what glennon said— when children are dying and being starved, it is NOT complicated. We fight for / feed/ stand up for them. 🩷
Love it! I really thought this podcast would be too much for me… too much analysis of feelings lol - but I genuinely love it and I love how they all play off each other. It’s so fun and I always learn a new way to think about something! Thank you all.
Reflecting back, looking forward At age 71, I spend most of my day painting, writing and thinking. I think about many random things: something I heard on a podcast, read, watched on social media or something said by my husband of 42 years or either of my wonderfully interesting adult daughters. This podcast recommended by a daughter has given me such joy and curiosity as I use your topics as a filter to my life past and dreams for the future. I want to go back to school to learn new skills—be a scientist, a psychologist, a better artist, a linguist or anthropologist or archeologist. I resent that I don’t have lifetimes left to learn more about life, but it is a limitation I must accept as, alas, I am not a vampire. Thank you for stimulating my imagination and sharing your experiences and knowledge.
Forever, favorite I’ve been listening to Mandy for years and love her podcast so much. She has great guests and I love hearing her thoughts you can tell she puts a lot of prep into the episodes and they are really high value.
Two-way prayer-Amazing When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. I felt like that this week when a new woman appearing my life then shared your podcast with me. It reaffirmed I am on a healthy, growth, spiritual journey. I love Love and it always loves me and each of us. Thank you Abby for your vulnerability and to all of you for the conversation!
Episode 285 As I drove the streets of Boise, ID I was taken to moments in my marriage, raising children in the mountains of McCall, back to my original family in the dust of Bakersfield. There were too many ah ha moments. Moments of clarity and hope. Thank you for these amazing pod casts.
always moved or inspired I have been listening to these wonderful humans for years, starting during some very hard times in my life. I am always moved or inspired by the things Glennon, Abby, and Amanda share, and having a small circle…it helps to hear them processing so many of the same emotions life brings. We can all have a thousand different situations that lead us to go through such similar emotional experiences, and to hear them share what they’re learning is such a gift. They’ve created a community where we truly see so many hard things are greatly lightened by opening up to ourselves and others. I never miss an episode and share them with my sister all the time…I’m a late diagnosed neurodivergent woman and I relate to so much. Thank you, ladies. ❤️
Meh. Trash. Not a fan.
This is it H-e-l-l-o 💜🙌 What can I say that you all don’t? That’s what I’M talkin about Big love 🤙🫶 P.S. thank you for playing the song at the end it helps me have a good cry. Every time!  it’s like a cleansing or baptism sent by the cosmos.
Stuff First, this episode kind of broke me open. I have been stuck with all of the mental and physical stuff for years. I loved all of the conversations around what stuff means to people and I think after listening that I’m finally ready to let go of the baggage. Thank you.
Phenomenally Inspiring I just listened to the double date episode with Brandi & Catherine Carlile (whom I’m obsessed with) and y'all made this so much fun! There are serious knowledgeable moments and lots of laughs at the same time. It’s nice to hear other lesbian/gay couples’ perspectives on relationships and how they navigate conflicts and all the hard things. It seems as though there is a lot in common (for my wife and I as a lesbian couple) and just in general, more than we know! Also, y'all weren’t wrong- Catherine’s voice is absolutely quintessential and I think that you should have them on the show again! I thoroughly enjoyed it =)
We can do hard things belief I love this podcast because it is actually making me believe that we can do hard things.
Keeping it real Always open, vulnerable, funny…  & bringing on the most useful, inspiring people. Thanks for seeing me & so many others that need help staying fully present, in a broken, complicated world. ❤️❤️❤️
Love this This podcast makes me cry, makes me laugh and makes me feel less alone in the world. And OMG, the theme song with Tish Melton and Brandi Carlisle is so profoundly beautiful.
Life altering The episodes on sadness and Glennon’s letter from love border on spiritual priesthood for me. There are some true gems of episodes in this podcast ✨
Just what I needed So so so good. That’s it
Devoted Listener! I resisted this podcast for a while because i DONT want to do hard things.  I’m a 40 year old woman who has done enough hard things, damnit! 😂 I’m inviting ease, pleasure, connection, and self-awareness into this decade, and low-and-behold, this podcast supports me in all of that. I’ve come to love Amanda, Abby, and Glennon, as well as their insightful, quirky, vulnerable guests, and appreciate how the pod has slowly shifted over the years. Here’s to doing fewer hard things, but trusting ourselves enough to know that we CAN get through them when we have to. 💖
The best Brings me so much joy every week, but also deeply grateful for their support of Gaza and Palestine. Yes there is a complex history but it shouldn’t be controversial to say that murdering and starving children is wrong!
End the genocide in Gaza Thank you so much for speaking up in support for the civilians in Gaza!!
More Abby and Amanda I love you 3 and your topics and your intelligent conversations. Would love to hear more from the incomparable Abby and wonderful smart Amanda! Also please take Abby out to dinner. Maybe every month or 2. ;)
Feeds My Soul I love this podcast!  It makes me so happy to feel like there are people like Glennon, Abbey and sister that just get all of it - the beauty, the horror, the messiness that is this human experience.  I feel more connected to myself and the humanity when I listen.  Thank you ladies !!🙏🙏
A “take away” in every episode Thoroughly appreciate this podcast. Even when you can’t see it coming- there is an a-ha moment in each episode. The recent episodes on Emotionally Immature Parents were profoundly helpful-I had read the books- but Lindsay Gibson and the conversation she generates- along with Abby’s comments especially hit home. I frequently all around reminding myself- “ if they want to hear you, it doesn’t matter what you say, if they don’t want to hear you, it doesn’t matter what you say”.  Thanks for leading the way and opening the door for so many important discussions!
Most caring and compassionate Glennon, Abby, Amanda - the most caring and compassionate women!! I would give you all the stars if I could but I can only give you five plus my heart. Love love love.
Who should play Amanda How ABOUT Amanda Peet???!
Godsend I’ve been a listener since the beginning, and I continue to be thankful for the meaningful conversations G, Abby, and Sister have that we get to listen to! They help me feel less alone in this dark cold lonely world.
Stuff Great thoughts!  I wonder if the way we handle “stuff” is as old as our primitive drive as hunters (needed now stuff) and gatherers (always be prepared stuff).  So yes, abundance/scarcity driven. Which explains why boomers hang on to stuff and millennials don’t.  A difference in how much has been available or accessible in life.   Love the discussion!!
3 friends in your ear Just so raw and human love the honesty of life’s experiences.
Relatable and Profound I really enjoyed episode 276 (about grief). I recently lost my mom and could relate to many of the profound sentiments that were beautifully expressed by Dan and the hosts. Congrats on a great show. I look forward to listening to more. - Tamara Miller Davis
I keep coming back This is my favorite podcast forever and ever, and nothing can top it. People recommend other podcasts and I try them out but always come back to WCDHT. It is all my favorite conversation topics and explored with unmatched authenticity, curiosity, vulnerability, bravery, and wisdom. I’m so grateful for Glennon, Abby, Amanda, the pod squad, and all the incredibly wise guests. I love you all - we can do hard things!!
Organic I am late to the party and must listen to the episodes in order- I just listened to the first podcasts with Liz Gilbert and this conversation is so organic and genuine. Some of my favorite podcasts
Childfree and Content A friend sent me the episode on child-free women and I’m having trouble writing this as there appears to be something in my eyes (for the third time since the episode started.)  :-)    I’m 52, single and haven’t wanted to have kids since my early thirties.  In my 20s, I think I was a “sheep”….I would go to college, get married and have kids…which, I later learned was exactly was my mom did (because that’s was everyone else was doing)  only for her, she found that she was unfulfilled as a mother, so my parents divorced and I was raised by my dad.  Needless to say, I had a quite tenuous relationship with my mom.    It was at the point in the show when you talked about the reasons why, that hit me the most, and for which I am so thankful was discussed.  I’ve often said “everyone is f%caked up because of something their parents did, so I don’t need to bring another f€cked up human being into the world :-).” And most people nod their heads.  But it’s in a space like you created in this show, that allows women to be seen, and heard, for whatever reasons they have.  Thank you.   Thank you for reading the letter from Liz, AND, for taking action to address her feelings (and those of so many of us) through the beautiful conversation you with Ruby.
I don’t listen to anything else now It’s official — there’s literally no other podcast I turn to than this one. These three women, their hearts, their brains, their conversations, their humor, their depth, their stories… truly just the best. Beyond grateful they exist and continue to share such meaningful work with us. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
Glenn and Doyle I have long believed that my daughter, now almost 18, is the wisest human I know. I marvel that someone so extraordinary could have started out in my very body. She is brilliant, in both meanings of the word.   But she just asked me how Glenn and Doyle are related - “and who is the third person on your podcast?” and now I am rethinking all of it.
Thanks for the CFBC Shoutout THANK YOU for the Childfree by Choice episode. The person writing in was spot on. I find it so challenging to exist professionally and personally and feel comfortable sharing this part of myself with people outside of my very close circle. It’s taken some of those closest to me a long time to accept this fact about the choices I have made for the trajectory of my own life. I’ve had strangers who have barely just learned my name followed by learning that I don’t have or want kids tell me that I’ll change my mind or I’m making a huge mistake, and it always sends me into a tailspin about the narratives that women are fed; it’s as if we don’t know ourselves better than someone passing us on the street would! And NEWSFLASH: I don’t want to talk about your kids either! They’re just not that interesting! I could go on about it forever, as it’s been a real pain point for me since my early 20s. Really, THANK YOU for bringing this conversation forward for the greater public to acknowledge and digest!
Thank you for talking about the hard things Thank you for deep diving into all the things we may feel shame for and normally avoid. Your podcast is incredibly validating and significantly therapeutic.
Almost three years and counting I listened to this podcast beginning with the first episode on it’s inaugural launch day. Almost three years later and I still am an avid listener. They bring so much value, nuance, humor, and enlightenment to important conversations. I have used so many ideas they brought to my attention to improve my quality of life, friends, and my clients (I’m a life coach). They are the only “must listen” out of the dozens of podcasts I’m subscribed to. I’ve listened to every episode.   The real question is…why did it take me this long to write a review? I literally thought I did this YEARS ago 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Antisemetic Can no longer support. Glennon hasn’t made one comment about the Israeli woman sexually abused and mutilated and it’s really disappointing her lack of compassion
281 Amanda’s Letter from Love So this was the 1st time I have listened. Huge fan of all 3. What a conversation made me feel so much~ tears laughter ah has. Gratitude for my own sister and friends and love itself. Thanks for this realness. My heart is wide open!
Me too unless you’re a Jew I have been following Glennon’s career for a very long time. I have seen her speak in person, bought her books, and have listened to the podcast from day one. I am not going to say I’m surprised that Glennon jumped on the “progressive“ left antisemitism bandwagon, but I am incredibly disappointed. As someone who makes their living writing and speaking, she should know better than to use words incorrectly and weaponize them towards a group of people. The attempt at speaking to things she has no lived experience in is wrong and needs to stop.
Helping us imagine and create the world we want to live in and embody I’ve listened to WCDHT for years now and love the range of emotions from insight to tenderness to spit out my water laughing that each episode seems to offer.  I very much believe no one is coming to save us and we need to build the world we want to live in and embody. These podcast conversations are helping us imagine what that world would look like.   And, get practical about how to extract patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism from within ourselves (i.e. hustle culture, fat phobia) so we can individually and collectively lead ourselves to a more holistically healthy and joyful world.   And as someone who works with people who have chronically battled food via my Truce with Food process, I especially appreciate Glennon’s willingness to seek recovery for her anorexia and be able to vocalize her recovery process in these episodes so clearly.  Because of where our cultural narrative is around food, it’s hard to articulate that it is and isn’t about the food. For example, I LOVED when Glennon realized she had defined discipline as control (my clients come to realize this too!). Because once you can see this, you can also see you do have a choice to self-author new values as it’s not that discipline isn’t needed, it’s just that discipline as control isn’t sustainable, effective, or fulfilling.   I think WCDHT is implicitly helping so many of us realize we can redefine values like discipline - whether with our bodies, recovery, parenting, or grief (love the Dan Levy, Laura McKowen and Dr. Becky episodes!) as devotion to what we want to see created and alive in the world.   As a podcast host myself (Insatiable), I know podcasting is a labor of love. I hope Glennon, Abby, and Amanda continue to midwife us to a new world order.
the hardest things i’m very late to this pod party! this podcast found its way into my life just when i needed it most, at a time of breakdown and re-creation of my life. these people make me incredibly proud to be a human, a beginner, and a lover of my life. thank you for your complexity, your honesty, and your steadfast commitment to healing. thank you for bringing andrea gibson into my life. thank you for utilizing your platform to speak up for palestine. thank you, glennon, for the enneagram episodes and for being brave enough to walk this earth as a sibling 4. thank you for sitting with your shame and confronting addiction. you are models of radical acceptance and vulnerability. thanks for lighting up my path as i welcome grief, slow down, and do the hardest work of my life.
Valentine’s Day Surprise Just listened and LOVED the surprise. I was on a walk and crying ugly tears of joy. Amazing.
Every episode is insightful I have listened to well over 75 episodes and every episode- I find myself saying something out loud in agreement or an acknowledgment. As a gay male, I’ve learned so much more humility- Thank you.! Your Valentine episode, perfect- and would add -I have evolved the holiday to be more about sending notes, cards, or phone calls to elder people who may be more alone, and not hearing from enough people. I make sure that they know they are not forgotten by someone specifically from myself and my husband, who have known them for sometime and want to make sure that, they are remembered.
Weird and woke and vapid Omggg how does anyone listen to glennon whine on and pretend to be deep. The only semi interesting person is her sister. Glennon is just vapid and performative.
Bye Glennon and Abby So sad to have to unfollow, feels like a break up. Your words MATTER to me and my Jewish family. I can no longer support you.
Downhill Started out well. Sister is the brains of the operation. Went downhill for me when Abby came on full time. Unfollowing now that Glennon has made antisemitic posts on IG. Really disappointing as I saw her in person in 2015, so I’ve been a supporter for a long time.
True colors Unfortunately Glennon is more concerned with people pleasing then knowing the facts. So sad that she uses her platform to create more divide between Israel and Palestine.
Thank you! Your show is very inspiring to me, as a newly divorced woman, i have found strength and encouragement by listening to your show. This valentines day one was really good. I hesitated to listen but so glad i did! I have bought myself roses and heart shapes chocolates because i DO love me:) AND i will be loved by an amazing partner one day soon! 💕thank you again for your vulnerability, and encouragment🌹
V day episode “We have lives that I believe we all deserve”???? “We have lives that I believe we all deserve”?? Really?? That was painful to hear!
Great until… until Glennon starting spewing pro Hamas rhetoric online. No thank you. Words matter.
Thank you for speaking up I’ve been listening to your podcast since it first launched and I just want to say I am grateful that you are standing up for what’s right
Hypocrisy An echo chamber of hypocrisy.
I love sisters 👯‍♀️ #teamrebuild🫶🏻 you folks are amazing! I love how you are changing the conversation!
Antisemitic, spreading hate against Jews For someone so influential in the self help world I’m surprised to see such one sided hate against Jews. You are wildly misinformed and quite frankly pretty stupid to believe in the propaganda. As a ‘feminist’ where is your outrage against the rapes and murders of women and children?!  Unfollowing.
What/ to whom  will you pour your love into Episode 278 hit deep for me on so many levels! I’ve been listening to WCDHT podcast since the beginning and just when I think there cannot be another podcast more meaningful to me and my life… BAM! another awesome episode drops! I am clearing my schedule this morning to write a life review with the subject of this podcast as the impetus.  I also ordered Sober Curious even though I have been sober for 23 years! We can all learn no matter what age and stage of life we are in!
Deep, profound and real conversations with real people I love the work you are doing and the truth and honesty you share with the world! Being willing to show up as your true self is not something the world typically welcomes but that’s the world I have always wanted. Thank you for your beautiful expression of real lives in a hard world. I love you all.
I am not alone. I love that this show brings on so many different stories and lives that prove that we are not alone in our struggles. No matter what is going on with you, there are some stories shared here that give you a community of understanding. I don’t agree with everything said, but I appreciate everything that is shared. Oh, and that theme song should be available for me to download on iTunes because I’d use it every morning as I get ready for work to calm my anxiety and step into the day on a positive note. Last, I love that as an actor, I’m able to hear what is happening in the lives of so many people. It gives me empathy to try to understand how the “other half” lives. Thank you all for your vulnerability and keep on keeping on.
Laugh out loud every time Life is hard, and this podcast repeatedly puts a smile on my face and makes my load lighter. So many amazing guests with invaluable lessons and the chemistry between Glennon, Abby, and Amanda is always laugh out loud funny. I loved the emotionally immature people episode series and shared with multiple friends and family. Thank you for reminding me to play, find ease with all the things, and dance through life. It’s not that serious and when it is, we can do hard things. The theme song at the end always makes me choke up a bit because I swear it says exactly what is on my heart. Sometimes I listen to it on repeat on Spotify 🫶🏼 Thank you so much for this kind and playful space! I love it here!
So real and unapologetic Listening to these three and their guests often feels like the best part of my week. I learn so much about myself.
White feminism 101 Deeply disappointed that this podcast, which I used to love, is yet another iteration of capitalistic yt feminism. Four months later and you have not spoken once about the current genocides and centered a Zionist celebrity guest instead to talk about, of all subjects, grief. Then an episode about a white girl party in Mexico?? Completely tone-deaf. I’ll say the hard thing you won’t: End the occupation, free Palestine.
We can do hard things! I love, love, love this podcast.
