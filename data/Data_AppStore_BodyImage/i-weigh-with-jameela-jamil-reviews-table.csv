2,Me me me,"I heard Jamilia on another podcast and liked her, so was stoked to find she had her own show. By show three I was tired of her voice. She has so many interesting people on but she always ends up talking about herself and her own feelings. I also got bored of the constant mental health talk, like it’s the most interesting thing about the guests she chats to. They have achieved some incredible things but they always end up saying the generic mental health quotes."
1,Let your guest speak.,Please let you guest speak.  I listen less now as I find the host wants to share her knowledge which reduces the opportunity for the guest to talk.
5,Clementine Ford,"Absolutely fascinating, could have listened all day. Wish this episode had been longer, I think there are loads of other topics you could have Clementine come back to discuss! Thanks for a great episode"
5,The best podcast,"I have listened to every episode of I Weigh. Jameela discusses topics, issues and questions that most of us face in this modern world and normalises the madness we live in to bring us together, make us laugh and not feel so ashamed or alone. Thank you Jameela for being you and sharing your beautiful mind with us xxxxx"
5,Brilliant,"I’ve genuinely enjoyed so many of the episodes and seriously tip my hat to Jameela for her openness, eloquence, frankness, energy. I have also recently lost my parents and several other losses have given rise to grief - the episode about grief with Megan Devine is the most refreshing take on grief that I’ve yet to hear. It resonates."
5,Particularly excellent episode about grief,The episode about grief with Megan Devine was so good. Such an important skill to know and experience to understand
1,Great guests but does let them speak!,Listened because I love the Instagram and heard about the Katherine Ryan interview - disappointed that it was more Jameela interviewing herself and less time listening to Katherine’s interesting story and words. Had to work hard to finish the episode.
5,I love Jameela Jamil,Just listening to Jameela and Atsuko Okatsuka and I’m in for the how to make adult friends reality show! Jameela I love your Britishness amongst the US culture. I’m Celtic Australian and I feel seen by you.
5,Social Understanding on Hard Mode,"I cannot believe just how much I’ve learnt through this podcast… raw, confronting at times, but in all inspires people to see the world through the eyes of others who are vilified, extremely misunderstood, or harshly discriminated against, as well as celebrates people being human.
I love the fact that the conversation revolves around shame and how that dictates every day life, and this beautiful ongoing discussion embodies healing and recognition in the way of acknowledging the sum of our parts without the superficial aesthetic pursuit.
Thank you Jameela."
5,Amazing.,Thank you Jameela.
5,Excellent,"This podcast so excellent, I don’t even have the words to describe how excellent it is.
It’s had such a positive impact on my mental health and self worth and I’m learning so much! 
Thank you Jameela"
5,The best.,My all time favourite podcast. I appreciate the insights and learnings each week and everything this podcast stands for. Thank you!
5,Jameela is at the vanguard of the zeitgeist today,"Rarely there emerges a voice that brings  challenge, representation and relief. One word: resonant."
3,Let your guests speak! 😂,"I do like this podcast and revisit it sporadically, however it makes me so uncomfortable when Jameela asks her guests questions and more often than not, completely hijacks their answers, guesses what they’re going to say or just starts telling a story about her own experience and never lets them finish before moving on to the next question. There are some really interesting guests on here but it always sounds like Jameela is constantly trying to prove how much she knows instead of letting the guest speak. Pleaseeee stop interrupting your guests and let them finish a sentence! 😓😓"
5,❤️,Thank you Jameela & team for this delightful podcast.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE✨✨🤘🏽,You are beyond amazing. Going through and re-listening to them now. Thank you for everything you do.
5,Hilarious and informative,"Jameela is the bestie you wish you had growing up.  I love how open, honest and raw each interview is.  Definitely one of my fav’s!"
3,Silence can be golden,I really want to love this podcast. The guests are tops. The information shared is helpful and interesting. But I really need the host to let her guests speak. The occasional personal anecdote is fine but let your guests respond.
5,New favourite,I initially reached for the interviews with names I recognised but then I got hooked and now I’m addicted to every single episode.
5,I'm obsessed!,"This podcast is life-changing! It's giving me my voice back, and slowly dissipating my self loathing... Thank you!"
3,Great Podcast,Absolutely love everything you stand for! And love your guests but can you please let the guests speak more. Too often they give a quick answer and then you go back to talking about yourself. I love you and love hearing from you but want to hear the guests speak more
5,Love this podcast,"Jameela is so thoughtful and curious during these interviews. I’ve loved all of them so far.

Also just wanted to say... you can be on ADHD medication and antidepressants at the same time 👍"
3,Let guests speak more,"I was looking forward to the Margaret Cho episode but I barely heard Margaret talk, it was all the host!! Very disappointing. Please talk less about yourself and let your amazing guests really talk/elaborate - not just give a short answer and have you take over."
5,Breath of fresh air,"I’m so grateful to have discovered this Podcast. Thank you Jameela for the honest conversations, for making me think and reflect and for introducing me to so many interesting people."
5,Fabulous listening,"Really appreciate your podcasts helpful healing interesting love & thanks from Australia
Amanda xx"
5,Love this but please ask yr guest more...,"This is a wonderful podcast, and Jameela Jamil has a lot to say that I want to hear. Here’s the BUT: sometimes too much interviewing herself and not hearing enough from the guest. I DO want to hear her too...but not at the expense of really hearing from the guest."
5,6 stars out of 5.,"Everything about ‘I weigh’ is revolutionary. Not only does this podcast (and the absolutely inspiring Jameela Jamil) educate myself and people around me, but it too holds my actions to account and supports me to be the best me I can possible be. Tongue twister right there. If I can say one thing, listen."
5,Love this podcast,Love listening to this podcast while working from home. Thank you!
5,Thank you so much!,"Thank you, thank you for the episode with Caitlin Moran. Weirdly enough, I’d just bought her book 2 days ago (but haven’t yet started it) without realising the component about having a child with an ED. My daughter has been battling anorexia for almost 2 years (that we know of) and longer before we knew. As her mother, I’ve done so many of the wrong things you describe. This was so good to hear. You may also be interested to know of another book I just listened to - Your Own Kind of Girl by Clare Bowditch. She also suffered with ED and had a break down. And it has a happy ending!"
3,Brilliant,I think she just needs to listen to her interviewees a little more. She talked over Gloria Steinem a lot.
5,Favourite pod THANK YOU,"I am SO glad this podcast, this movement, this wonderful community exist! i_weigh has gotten me personally through really difficult times in my life, really helped shift my own internalised stigma (for myself, not others) against mental health and the associated shame I have with myself, and opened my mind so many marginalised communities. It is honest, real, fun, sad, and so so important. This podcast, I think, is truly monumental in destroying the patriarchy, fat-phobic-ness, racism, homophobia….all the negative aspects of human kind. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU…this has truly done so much for so many, including helped bring me back from the brink <3 xoxoxox"
5,Great podcast,Very interesting podcast
5,Refreshing real conversation,that is not just a promotional opportunity. The conversations are engaging and hearing these stories help with understanding or consideration of other views.
5,The best,"I really love this podcast. It’s refreshing, unfiltered and also just real. Talking about the elephant in the room (or what was) and spreading good messages.
Thank you."
5,Reminder,"This podcast is an excellent reminder of what is good, what is important, and what needs attention. Jameela is an excellent host who’s empathy and compassion is audible, who is willing to bear all with your community, and fights for education and understanding. I couldn’t recommend a better listen."
5,I weigh is a ripper.,Absolutely adore Jameela and the guests!! Such  needed conversations about so many stigmatised issues with opened minded and progressive people.. I live for this + bang on about it to ALL my friends!
5,Very insightful,Love these chats - helping me educate myself on very important topics
5,Essential listening,"This podcast has helped me already so much with such honest and insightful conversations, as well as being highly entertaining. Jameela Jamil is a natural and the guests are all amazing. Thank you x"
5,New favourite podcast,"Jameela Jamil is such an interesting, funny host and the guests she gets on the podcast are equally interesting. There’s so much good stuff! A really uplifting listen 😀😀."
5,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!,Wow! How eye opening and raw! You are blowing my mind with so many reality hits and slaps to the face (in a good way haha). I feel incredibly grounded after every episode. But also incredibly overwhelmed with emotion. I’m learning a lot about myself and how to be a better person to myself and others. Thank you so much 🥰
5,Wow!,"This podcast is the best! I hang out for new episodes every week. It is so raw, honest but also so funny and charming. I love it :) thank you!"
5,Best podcast to date.,Highlight of my week. Witty yet hard hitting. I’m listening from Australia and I’m so very thankful for this podcast right now. Grateful for relatable non judgmental and open content. This podcast is helping de stigmatise a range of topics and I’m here for it. Your a queen Jameela 🙏🏼
5,my new favourite podcast ❤️,"Hi Jameela!

I just wanted to give you and the amazing people that make this podcast a reality a big THANK YOU!! 

I love your discussions with your guests, and I especially love how you talk so freely and expressively about what is right. I have learned so much in a single hour than I would in a week. I have realised that I have been seeing my self worth to be just a number or the way people may look at me - but you proved it wrong again and again. You are truly my inspiration 💓

If I could give a thousand stars, I would."
5,LOVE,Fantastic podcast!
5,Thank you!,Love the podcast!
5,Love love love,"Love this. Love everything Jameela does. Please continue to spread your message of acceptance, tolerance, empowerment and celebration of diversity."
5,Thank you!,I love this podcast so much. I love your candid interviews with people who come from diverse and varied backgrounds. Your interviewing techniques are light yet in depth and interesting. Please keep making this podcast. Thank you Jameela and your team.
5,This Podcast makes me want to change the World!,"Two episodes in and I am OBSESSED. Open, honest, funny and full of inspiration and some keen insights into the world we live in - this podcast gets you in the feels in a big way.
I can’t recommend enough!"
5,Love it,Love it- positive but down to earth and validating of the real experiences of different people <3
5,LOVE THIS!,Can’t wait for more! So good
5,Great chat,"Brilliant chat! As a gay man who has struggled with body image and dysmorphia this was a really awesome chat that I was able to empathise with. 

I suspect the world needs these insightful and amazing chats in the current COVID-19 climate!"
5,THANK YOU.,THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
5,Absolutely adore this!,"Jameela you are a revolution - thank you for being you and for inspiring these awesome conversations to happen. I feel so seen right now. Amazing first guest, I LOVE The Bean. Xx"
5,love this!,love this and can’t wait for the next episodes!!!
5,"Seriously witty, majorly worth a listen!","I love listening to serious topics about serious issues, wrapped in comedy with a side order of emotional punch... these “I weigh” discussions happen to touch my heart in ways I didn’t even think I needed. I’m in feminism training and I believe breaking down the construct of societal expectations on women is vitally important...  But most of all I just Love listening to the beautifully lilting & fast witted Pommy accent of Jameela Jamil!"
5,I’ve learnt so much!,"I LOVE this podcast. I’ve learnt about so many different topics I have honestly never thought about. It’s helping me become a more open person, has helped me accept myself and just massively broadened my horizon."
1,ugh,This woman has really capitalised on the current social climate and good for her I guess….but my goodness what a narcissist!!! She’s a complete hypocrite IMHO when it comes to all the body positivity stuff - claiming to be opposed to the commodification of women’s bodies while simultaneously constantly posting heavily edited photos of herself dressed up like some kind of pick me princess... good luck to this incredible grifter 🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
5,Episode 10 with ALOK ✨,"Episode 10 with ALOK was the best podcast episode I’ve ever heard! The LGBTQ+ community was always something I knew about and supported. Listening to this episode made me realize how little I knew about it and is making me realize how little I’m doing for the community! I can’t wait to buy the book and I’m looking into helping my local LGBTQ+ organizations during this pandemic (and hopefully after too). Thank you so much Jameela for creating this podcast and shedding light on topics and incredible people that deserve more attention, help and support! I love all of the guests and you have really awesome questions :)"
5,Love it!!,"Amazing podcast, I have learned and grown so much by listenig to this powerful podcast."
5,Love it !!,"This is such a motivating podcast! 
Love to listen to it while working ❤️
Merci for the laughs and tears!"
5,Just what I needed,"This is just what I needed. Some (body-) positive news, with one of my favourite presenters. Go and listen! ❤️"
5,Simply amazing!,I’ve been loving it! You are the only person who made me listen to a podcast fully! This is so entertaining and at the same time full of food for thought content.
5,Love it!!,Hi Jameela! I started listening to your podcast one month ago and it’s so far my favourite. 😍😍
5,Realest,Thank you for allowing me to look at my own shadows without shame; this journey with Jameela Jamil and guests is teaching me to love myself deeper and more completely and that I am not alone
5,Love this podcast,"I love Jameela’s honesty in her struggles with her body, her guests are wonderful and it’s overall just a safe space for my brain."
5,Uplifting podcast!!,"Thank you!! Love the new direction and focusing on how to better ourselves. You and Grace Campbell should both be on a podcast! You’re both hilarious, honest and sounds like 2 old friends! Love it!!! 💙 from 🇨🇦"
5,😍😍😍,Huge fan of the podcast! Been listening since it first started. I have grown so much as a result and absolutely love Jameela! Xoxo
5,Greta,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Thank you.
3,The music needs a small tweak…,"Brilliant podcast. I feel like I’m being snuggled by the warmth and love of all the messages that Jameela is sending in her soothing voice. Even the guests I’m not keen on listening to, I end up loving. Thanks for using your platform to spread awareness for such important human issues with all of your brilliance!! 
BUT at the segment break, the music (sax? Trumpet? I’m not sure!) makes me literally jump because it sounds like a train is coming. It freaks me out every time, even when I’m on the freeway! Like obvs no train is coming… it’s life a reflex lol Driving is the only time I listen! 
 I know it’s your longtime bf so I’m really sorry to say. ❤️"
5,Ask Jamilla anything.,"I listened to my first episode and it was ask me anything, where you spoke about weight loss. Good for you for your honesty. I wish more of Hollywood would speak out like this. Good for you."
5,Much needed real talk,"I appreciate this podcast and the diverse topics. The host is so honest and authentic with a side of
Silly."
5,I LOVE YOU!!!,"Thank you, you’re podcast is amazing. It has helped me come to terms with my body dysmorphia and mental health."
5,Grateful,This podcast has changed my life! Thank you for being honest and speaking so truthfully!! Xox
5,Incredibly Empowering! I’m hooked.,"I was introduced to this podcast about a month ago when my sister shared the episode with Maisie Hill. Ever since I have been OBSESSED. Jameela is so frank, vulnerable and intelligent. I love her and I love this show. Thank you Jameela and thank you to all the incredible guests who speak so openly on this podcast!"
5,The best!,"Interesting and empowering topics! I love everything about this podcast. Thank you, Jameela :)"
5,Great listen,Jameela is wonderful and addresses meaningful topics in a relatable way.
5,Absolutely love!,"diverse, positive, and absolutely necessary conversations. What a great podcast! Highly recommend to anyone- there’s loads of interesting things to learn and different perspectives shown. Can’t get enough!"
5,Love this podcast!,"I love the guests; I love the dirty, dumb jokes; and most of all, I love Jameela’s approach that we’re all just learning and trying to do our best."
5,A Change Your Life Kind of Podcast - BANGER!,"I LOVE this podcast. Whether it’s the mindfully inclusive and sensitive way that Jameela phrases and constructs her questions (which gives me pause to do the same in my own life), her candid revelations about her own mental health journey, or how each guest along with the host gives a little bit of themselves to us, thereby enriching our own lives and unearthing methodologies and coping strategies to help us live them. 
This podcast gives you something. You’ll yell “Yes!”, “Exactly!”, “Wow!” You’ll cry. You’ll laugh. You’ll find parts of yourself you didn’t know were there. Most importantly this evicts you from feeling like you’re alone in this world and that you’re the only person dealing with what you are dealing with. Cuz babe, ya ain’t! ❤️"
5,This Lady Is The Best!,Wow!! I don’t even know how to explain how much I love this lady and this podcast! So many topics that are so important for anyone to hear! Thank you for continuing to create this wonderful source of information.
5,A great podcast,I discovered this podcast about a year ago and since following I’ve learnt so much and feel that it’s added so much value. Thank you for all that you do. I truly admire all the hard work you are doing
1,Insufferable,Dr Jen Gunter is toxic. Unsubscribed for poorly choice of guest.
5,Love love,"One of my favourite podcasts ever, Jameela is an amazing host."
5,I keep learning so much from this pod,Jameela is so funny and authentic and this podcast will make you laugh and cry and think! Great and interesting guests with so much to share. Thank you!
5,You’re great x,"Podcast is boss.  Love it!
Any chance you’d consider easing up on the cuss words?  Only because I’d like to listen while the kiddo is around 😃
Thanks for all you do!"
5,Self care,"Absolutely addicted to Jameela’s honest, raw and sarcastic sense of humour when she addresses so many relatable issues in society today. I have made iweigh staple in my Sunday self-care routine and have yet to be disappointed by an episode."
5,Well,I feel like all other 5 star ratings I’ve given up as a lie now.  The bar just got higher.
5,This podcast is so important,So important for people everywhere to hear these messages. Thank you Jamila 🙏❤️
5,Neal Brennan and Jameela,Delightful! I love how these two interact and bounce off each other!  Best episode yet!
5,❤️,Love Jameela and this podcast so much❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,Thank you Jameela!!,"Being a white woman, listening to this podcast has helped me with my intersectional feminism and direction in where I can learn more from marginalized folks

Love how open Jameela is about her mental health, weight changes, sexuality, etc."
4,Great podcast,"I love this podcast and the guests. The discussions are great. However, I’d like there to be a timing given when there’s a trigger warning because otherwise it just comes up and it is not funny when people give their actual weight when asked what they weigh."
4,Well-intentioned,"I would love to rate this five stars. These are such insightful and helpful conversations. I think Jameela is improving as an interviewer, but there are a lot of interruptions of the guests. It struck me especially when she interviewed Munroe Bergdorf. I feel like this happens the most when Jameela knows the guest well. She gave Matt McGorry plenty of space to answer. While there could be some improvement, I think it will come with time and experience with the format. I keep finding new activists to follow, so there is so much value for me in that alone."
4,Never miss an episode!,"This is a fabulous podcast, and I look forward to each episode. The guests and conversations are so intriguing and informative. I love Jameela’s humour and authenticity. Love love love iWeigh!"
5,Just THE best !,"Enlightening, brilliant, funny and REAL conversations. I love the way this podcast is recorded, Jameela and her guests talk about really intriguing topics and bring to light many issues I would never have thought of. The I Weigh podcast and I Weigh page/community helps me become aware of my ignorance. THANK YOU for the sharing."
5,love,"I love listenig to this podcast in the evening, sometimes I even do yoga while listening.  This podcast is great if you just want to chill out an feel good about yourself, learn to respect yourself and love yourself a little more.  thank you ❤️❤️"
5,Laughs and thoughts and farts.,"I loved Jameela’s episode with Aisling Bea. I laughed! I wrote down quotes (“Things should always be a listen-able moment, but they don’t need to be a teach-able moment”)! I added book recommendations to my audio book list (Period Power)! And I will definitely be listening to many more episodes. Bravo!!"
5,love love love it!,"I really love this podcast, has been GREAT listening to it while in quarantine!"
3,It has potential,"A lot of great guests and interesting topics discussed but I think the podcast would be smoother and more interesting if the guests were more the focus of the conversation. While it’s good for the host to agree and relate her own experience, the conversation should be more about the guest."
5,Love this podcast!,Jameela I LOVE this podcast and it couldn’t have come at a better time. You are so real and lovely and your dynamic with your guests is really enjoyable and insightful. Your guest choices are also absolutely incredible! What a hot pack to start with :)
5,"Fresh, honest, real, flaws and all","This is a great podcast especially in the time we are living in. Hearing how the conversations evolve and how flaws are celebrated is just a breath of fresh air. I appreciate the honestly and genuine nature of this podcast so much. I weigh my big heart, my empathetic nature and my independence as a woman. Thanks from Canada! Xoxo"
5,Amazing,Thanks Jameela for this podcast! I never comment on anything but your conversations around a woman’s layers of deep worth just uplifts me and my feelings around myself (as a “somewhat” recovered anorexic) every listen. Your words are so sadly refreshing but so absolutely welcomed and transformative. Thank you for everything you do and stand up for!
5,Love!,"I love Jameela and how empowering she is, along with the messages she is trying to give off! Love this podcast and cannot wait to see what other amazing guests have to say! ✨"
4,"Great, could use a little tweaking",Overall the conversations Jameela has been having with her guests are fantastic and I love it. However I would agree with other people’s comments about her talking style... she does talk over people a lot and it’s frustrating. She has a tendency to interrupt and redirect the conversation. I think if Jameela would slow down a little and let the guest speak more openly it would be a lot better.
5,Love!!,Love this podcast !! Would highly enjoy and interview with Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams :)
4,Love them!,"I agree with other reviews, that the guests should be able to talk more, the questions are a little long, but I still love it!"
3,Feedback,Love the podcast- guests are inspiring for a young woman in business. I would add to try and let the guest speak a bit more- I find they get interrupted too frequently.
5,"Empathy, everyone, please.","I am already a fan of @i_weigh and I love Jameela Jamil’s work. I think she might be just experiencing the “podcast debut gibberish” syndrome. ALL of the podcasts I’ve been following have started like this for the hosts. It’s the stress of wanting to cover all of your questions, of filling in all of the blanks, of naturally being excited/anxious for your firsts episodes.

You shouldn’t worry about it. So many hosts went through the same experience. I know Dax Shepard and Anna Faris got the same comments when they started. It is just gonna get easier, more natural and better and better over time.

Thank you Jameela for initiating much needed conversations
Love you🌈💛"
1,Insufferable,Jamil’s desperation for attention is unsettling. She needs to learn to listen and not talk for a while.
1,Would like to hear what guests have to say,I like the idea of this podcast but the guests were constantly being cut off.
5,Amazing,"This podcast is so fantastic. Only 2 episodes have been released, but Jameela Jamil’s honesty and fantastic interviewing skills make this podcast one of my favourites. This podcast educates, inspires, and entertains. I can’t say enough about this. Love all the way <3"
5,Thank you!,Just really awesome.
5,Thankyouthankyouthankyou,Two episodes in and I am already in love with this podcast.  THANK YOU for your interviews and work.  I love it all
5,Just what I needed,"Thoroughly enjoyed the banter and shared vulnerability! Natural flow of conversation much appreciated, I believe you do a great job of enabling your guests to speak. Thanks so much for providing insight and laughter."
1,Let Your Guests Speak,"That is all, really. Please let your guests get a word in 🙏🏻"
5,eye opening,definitely an amazing podcast that really helps open one’s eye to many overlooked topics!! i can think of so many people who need to listen to this! :D
5,❤️❤️❤️,Love love it!!!
1,The last thing we needed,"The last thing Jameela jamil needs is another platform for her to spew her highly misinformed takes on just about everything. The world would be better served if she sat down and listened for awhile. Listened to trans and non-binary voices, listened to poor voices, listened to fat women, just listened. Instead here she is attention seeking yet again."
5,Radical compassion - yes!!!,"I Weigh is gorgeous, gentle, hilarious, and compassionate. Exactly what we need in fatphobic culture."
1,Contrived and boring,Wasn’t impressed - the interview didn’t flow and was very negative
5,Thank you,I am an avid podcast listener. I love them all. This is my first review because what you’re sound is amazing and important.
5,Thank you ! ♥️,"Thank you so much to you and your team for putting a such interesting content out there. Listening to you having these conversations with your guests in such a natural and well thought out way has been a real pleasure since I discovered your podcast. It brings me joy, comfort, a feeling wellbeing (in a kind of ASMR way…) and so much food for thought. I always make sure to find some time for it. ♥️"
5,Spiritual break,"I feel understood when I listen to I Weigh. She is so special and magical. You can only feel better even when she talk about horrible things, somehow because she is so open and she said that nobody else is saying, it still feels good. 
She is my spiritual break and s the sense that I recharge my spiritual beliefs with her. Love you Jameela."
5,Thank you,"For your podcast ! Your voice, the tone, are amazing, and I like that you’re frank! The conversation flows and i love spending hours listening to it, even if I don’t know half of the people that are interviewed (I’m french). I learn so much! I hope you love making it as much as it is loved by listeners 🌞"
5,"Amazing podcast, host and guests",Thank you so much for this incredible podcast ! I look for forward to every episode ☺️
5,Amazing podcast,"The episode with Dr Jackson Katz was so great, thank you so much for this"
3,Needs to let her guests speak a bit more,"I love Jameela and all she stands for, but especially interviewing the tabloid journalist I felt that she dominated the convo a bit much. Anyone already familiar with Jameela will know her thoughts and opinions on the media well. I feel like her guests need to be given a bit more air time before she jumps in to add her thoughts and experiences."
5,Brilliant ❤️,"So funny, so smart! I’m always waiting for the next episode."
5,Just so good !,Such a great podcast ! So many different and interesting people as guests ♥️ I’m learning a lot on very various and important subjects.
5,A M A Z I N G,Everything’s in the title
5,Refreshing and inspiring!,"Love what you do Jameela, you’re so inspiring. Your podcasts are just perfect. Like a warm cup of hot chocolate on a snowy day. I’d love you to hear one with Marina. ☀️"
5,Thank you,"This is both educative & refreshing!! Amazing and needed podcast. Finally voices and stories we can identify with and reflect upon in our own path, our own personal struggle and journey to self-love & self-care."
5,Simply amazing,"This podcast is soooo good and remarkably funny! So many inspiring people!! Jameela you rock, thank you for what you do and who you are"
5,"Unusually honest, thank you","for putting yourself out there.
You are making a difference."
5,Thank you 🥰,Such a wonderful and powerful podcast ! Thank you ❤️
5,Empowering Jameela Jamil,The only thing I need to say is thank you for existing Jameela Jamil.
5,One of the best podcasts on here,I never miss an episode! It is a happy place and an amazing source of information and humanity for me. Thank you Jameela!
5,Love,"Love Jameela
Love this podcast
Love the guest selection"
5,Brilliant,"Love Jameela, love this podcast. She is a massive inspiration."
5,Delightful 🤩,"An absolute delight of a podcast! 💙…and on the side, you are supporting - of what is in my humble opinion a still very much underrated - movement!"
5,Truly life changing,I cannot express how much this podcast changed my life. I’ve never felt so seen and confirmed in my person. Thank you. Thank you for doing this.
5,Such a treasure,"Discovered this podcast only recently and am working my way through the back catalogue. So many interesting conversations, and so helpful in shifting the way we perceive ourselves and how we look. Absolutely love it!"
3,<3,"I really like Jameela and the topics all in all, but I would love to hear way more from the guests. Seems they don’t get the space they deserve. Therefore I feel why not just do a podcast without guests?"
5,Truly Beautiful,"I started listening to this podcast this morning on my walk and it accompanied me during my entire day, making me laugh, think, smile and cry.
Thank you Jameela and every guest she has on her podcast for creating this beautiful, healing space!"
5,Brilliant,"This podcast is simply amazing. I love how insightful, true and accurate it is and how it helps me to understand myself and others better. So grateful for this!"
1,Came to LISTEN  to Joanne Mcnally,😢😢😢 she didn’t have a chance in hell
5,I just discovered gold!,"Hi. 
Sorry about the cheesy subject line. I’m bad at subject lines. Horrendously bad. 
And I also used to be a comedy writer, so I have no excuse. But that is the reason I found this wonderful podcast, because I’m a Rachel Bloom fan and I listened to your interview with Rachel and… and then just kept listening… and over the course of a night when I couldn’t sleep I binge-listened to a lot more episodes and today, when I’m working (pretending to work) I’ve listened to several more.
I now have a new favourite podcast. That’s your fault. I hope you’re proud of yourself :)"
1,We want to hear from your guests!,"Episode with Joanne McNally, heard more about Jameela than Joanne. Let your guests talk!!!!"
5,Love this,"The episode with Clementine ford, was so true and it’s nice to know there are other people out there that think the same. I’ve been in a relationship for 25 years and not married. An don’t want to get married"
5,"Thought provoking, educational and funny","I have been listening to this podcast for a few years now and I've learnt so much. Jameela is such a funny and interesting host and I love hearing what she has to say and the natural conversation that occurs between her and her guests. The guests she has introduced me to have been so interesting and enlightening and have definitely helped me to be more compassionate and understanding.  It's been really fascinating to watching Jameela on this journey too, as she is clearly learning as much as we are from the podcast experience and I'm totally here for the more optimistic and self-empowerment vibes shining through in the more recent podcasts. As a woman just a few years younger than Jameela, it's incredible to have had this empowered female voice unapologetically taking up space (and yes, to those who said she 'talks too much', that includes taking up  as much space as she wants to on her OWN podcast and it's all interesting and often funny) and being willing to grow and change along with her audience. Ah, Jameela, you're the big badass sister I never had ❤️"
2,Really interesting but,"I love the topics and guests but Jamila, please let your guests speak and don’t cut in and talk over them. On few occasions you both are talking over each other and it’s in comfortable to listen to. As the one with the guests it’s important to allow them the time to talk and that accounts for periods of silence, that isn’t a Que to jump in and give examples etc. important to reflect on that as it’s slowly turning me off your podcast and seems like others and thinking the same. I really like the topics so plz, consider it!"
1,Guests need to be better researched,When this podcast first came out it was a breath of fresh air and inspirational. Unfortunately recently it has served to platform unqualified guests who are uncritically allowed to spread misinformation (e.g. the Glucose Goddess and Dr Caroline Leaf). I beg the producers to do 10-15 minutes of research on their guests beyond their own websites as what is said can be truly harmful to the audience.
5,Love this podcast!!,"It covers such a range of interesting, relevant and important topics, and Jameela is such a great host!"
5,One of my fav podcasters & badass women!,"I absolutely love you & your podcast.  You are a regular voice in my ears as I drive around London in my taxi at work.  Thank you keeping me company, for the tears of joy and laughter and for sharing your wisdom with us you absolute legend, much love from South East London xxxxx"
1,Weekly Virtue signalling,"This is exhausting to listen to, it’s just an endless echo chamber of people virtue signalling to each other. And Jameela as a host is completely insufferable, as 90% of every episode is just her talking and answering her own questions rather than letting the guests speak. Garbage."
5,Love from Jamaica 🇯🇲,"One of my favourite voices on Podcasts. I relate to so much of what you talk about and I love your instagram feed as well. Thank you for all you do and making my day, helping so many people and being real. I listen to you in the car, when I walk, and now as I have been in hospital for 11 days. Thank you, Jamila xxxx"
1,Meh,Meh
2,You will learn more about the host than the guests,Many great guests and interesting topics. Its just such a shame they are difficult to enjoy and learn from as the host constantly interrupts her experts and continually talks about herself so much so it’s impossible to listen too. Interrupting an expert talking about narcissism to talk about herself was the last straw…
1,I thought I would love this,It’s just a relentless feminist rant - exhausting - disappointing as I think Jameelia is so talented - this seems to be a vent for pent up anger.
5,Enlightening,"Out of curiosity, I listened to the Shon Faye interview and am reading her book. In recent times all I’ve heard on the media are problems with toilets, changing rooms, prisons, sports, etc, and nothing else. A very interesting and intelligent discussion and perspective which I had not heard before."
5,At last!,"A woman who is unafraid to tell it like it is. Takes no prisoners but is refreshing vulnerable at times👍you are an inspiration Jameela keep telling your truth, it is helpful for me and I’m sure many others out there.
Much gratitude Sandra."
5,Brilliant pairing.,"Simon and Jameela. Hilarious, moving and I’m off to get myself a comedy hat."
5,Josie Naughton and Jameela,March made in heaven. My favourite one so far
5,"Well done, Jameela!","I absolutely love this podcast and I think Jameela is excellent. Brilliant interviewer, balanced, focussed, articulate, astute and totally hilarious. This is a joy to listen as well as being incredibly important and informative"
2,Lots of potential but need to let guests talk,"Have listened a few times and really like Jameela and her guests however find that Jamil relates to the guests far too much / talks too much which is really frustrating once you notice it. You’re doing a great job and have great guests just please give them the space to speak, particularly noticeable on the Marina interview which I was so excited about but I feel like we barely got a chance to listen to her. All the ingredients are there (passionate, inquisitive host and interesting guests) but the interview style needs refining!"
5,Great conversations,This is great - interesting guests with diverse life experiences. And conversations are so much better than one sided interviews. Enjoying the podcast a lot!
5,Really great conversations,"I just had a quick scan of reviews so wanted to add my view. I’m a relatively new listener but really enjoying what I’ve heard. The variety of guests is so brilliant and I am learning loads. I can see that there’s a lot of criticism about Jameela talking a lot, but I am not tuning in for an interview. I like hearing the conversation; I think Jemeela often asks great questions and I like hearing her perspective. I feel like she creates a nice atmosphere and the guests respond well. I am so looking forward to hearing more."
1,Jameela Jamil Interviews Jameela Jamil,I tuned into this podcast to listen to the interview of Marina Diamandis. Little did I know it would be a 1 hour monologue by Jameela Jamil. The cardinal sin of an interviewer is to not let your interviewee speak and to constantly talk over them. Such a pity - hugely disappointing.
1,JAMEELA JAMIL PLEASE JUST STOP TALKING AND LET YOUR GUESTS SPEAK!!!,When is Jameela Jamil ever going to stop talking about herself and let the guests speak?  If you are a fan of hearing Jameela Jamil ask a question to her guest and then taking over to insert her own narrative then this is the podcast for you. She is always just waiting to respond.  She hasn’t had any guests  on that challenge her views....it’s just an echo chamber.....but mainly a vehicle for her to keep telling us HER back story and HER views.  But then that’s probably why it hovers in the back end of the top 200.  Seems like people are getting bored of her and her sociopathic narcissistic behaviour and her pathological lying.
4,So interesting but.....,I love these interviews but hate the swearing. I am not a prude but quite clearly when interviewees do  not swear neither does Jameela. So please do that all the time.
1,Let the guests speak,"Tuned in to here someone I admire speak about a topic they are educated in. Instead it was all about Jameela, the guest barely spoke. Jameela thought she was being interviewed"
5,Saved My Life,I don’t know where or who the hell I would’ve become without this podcast throughout 2020 to this present day. Thank you so bloody much Jameela you fearless goddess! This podcast is an essential part of my life now 💙
5,What a woman!,I love this podcast and how fearless Jameela is.
1,Let them speak!,"I love all the guests on this podcast and have tried many times to listen to it because of that fact, but I really wish Jameela would give the guests a chance to share their perspectives and not try and relate it back to herself all the time or turn it into a monologue about what she ‘knows’ on the subject. She should try to learn from the guests and be willing to have her opinion changed. It’s just unbearable to listen to which is such a shame because I am 100% here for the guests and topics."
5,diaryofahornyt,"This is my favourite podcast. Jameela's growth over the years is inspiring and I love how she is giving a platform to people with important things to say. It helps me in my journey of constantly evaluating the world around me and my place within it. It also helped me to find the confidence to start my own podcast, 'Diary of a Horny Teenager'. Granted it's a bit more silly than yours... but there is no doubt I was influenced by Jameela and the power of her amazing pod. Get listening gang, it's time to change the world!!!
Lots of love,
Georgie
@diaryofahornyt"
2,Not enough guest talk,I was really excited about listening to Dean Piper discussing his experience of the tabloids however I had to turn off after 40 minutes as it was mostly just Jameela talking and talking about herself
2,Great guests if only they were allowed to speak,"I really want to hear what these interesting guests have to say, and I do admire the host’s unwavering appetite to learn and grow, but she just steamrolls over the guests and answers her own questions. She does it with such vigour and volume that it’s impossible to think she even wants to hear anyone else’s opinion. It’s incredibly frustrating. If you jump ahead on the bits where she goes off on a rant, you can try to just listen to the guests."
2,Has so much potential,"After listening to multiple episodes, I feel a little exhausted by the ratio of Jameela chat vs the guests. It would be more balanced if she kept her questions concise, then listened to the answers and avoided bringing it back to her own point of view for an exhaustive time."
5,Please let your guest speak,Please let them have a chance to answer your questions
4,You’ve been my walking gal pal over lockdown,"I’ve laughed out loud cried tears of recognition and relief along with you & your excellent guests and gal pals. Jameela Jamil i weight the 2 kids I raised on my own, all the stories I’ve ever told and those I’ve yet to share i weigh two marriages two divorces 2 buried parents and generations of guilt i weigh the strength resilience and humour it takes to show up every day learn the next lesson have the loudest laugh. Thanks girlfriend x"
5,I LOVE this podcast,"I love this podcast so much it's so insightful and i especially like jameela's chatty interview style. I've seen a lot of reviews saying she talks too much or brings it back to her experiences but that's because it's HER own podcast. Don't listen to a podcast by jameela jamil if you don't want to hear her talk and that goes for any podcast. It's expected that the host talks and actually responds to their guests to make them feel welcome and that is EXACTLY what jameela does. Every guest feels like a friend because of the way jameela chats with them so it's such a nice listen! keep up the good work jameela and keep talking in your own podcast!!!! And to those of you complaining; women have been told to talk less for most of history, this is especially not the place to bring up that age old trope, it's time we started uplifting women and letting them speak, particularly on their OWN podcasts!!"
5,Excellent,Love Jameela and all the great work she does. This podcast has wonderful guests. I particularly like the episodes with medical and science professionals as I always learn something new from them.
2,Let the guests get a word in!,"I like the idea of this podcast and the guests are great, but it’s too bad that they don’t actually get to contribute much. It would be much better if Jameela would let them speak more rather than talking over the guests so often or bringing everything they say back to her and her experience. Each episode seems to be like 75% Jameela, 25% the guest. But hey, if you like her and are happy to mainly just listen to her for an hour, then this one’s for you!"
1,Can't listen!,Jameela is the worst interviewer I've heard! Everything has to relate to her and her own experiences which is cringy to listen to and hearing her interrupt everyone is unbearable!
5,Refreshing,Really down to earth conversations with incredible guests and talking about things we don’t hear enough. Resonates and relatable!
5,Best and most informative podcast,"Just listen, you’ll see 😊"
5,I would recommend EVERYONE listens to these podcasts,This podcast is so helpful so educating and so incredibly real! I absolutely love her and love the relationships she creates with the people she chats to! I relate to so many of the stories and experiences that are talked about and love that this educates me and informs me of things I strive to correct and share with others! Thank you for this and thank you for your honesty!
2,Frustratingly Daft,"One of the most irritatingly stupid podcasts around. The host boils everything down to either gender or race, and appears to lack any academic understanding of the issues while, at the same time, displaying an incredible level of confidence in the importance and validity of her own opinion. The host also agrees completely with everyone she interviews, making the whole thing a rather bland echo-chamber. If you want to learn anything about the topics covered here, look elsewhere."
1,Why hasn’t this gotten better?,Jameela is a bad interviewer. She relates to people so much she sounds like she is lying about everything.
5,great,talks about some really important topics and all the guests are individually inspiring in different ways. i think jameela is a great host and i really enjoy this podcast
1,Oh hun,"Dreadful Jamil seems to be more intent with sharing her point of view rather than hearing what the guests have to say.
Dull,disappointing and not a great listen"
5,Just brilliant,"I cannot get enough of these. Some I have listened to more than once. I look forward to hearing her interview her incredible guests every week, and I have honestly learned so much. Jameela Jamil is making such a valuable contribution to the world."
5,Brilliant,So naturally funny and easy to listen to
5,I can’t stop telling people about this podcast,"Jameela’s podcast is incredible. I love her attitude and wit, and her guests blow me away each week. I think I’ve loved every single guest thus far. Every episode I come away having learned something, and have added something to my ‘to-do’ list, whether it’s buying a guest’s book, or learning more on a certain topic.
I also can’t stop bringing it up. Frequently I say to my family or friends “I was listening to Jameela Jamil’s podcast today, and...”

5/5 would highly recommend."
5,Favourite podcast,I love Jameela and everything she stands for ! She always has the most amazing guests who have incredible story’s to share ❤️
5,Thoughtful and helpful,"Great guests, reflective and a force for good"
2,Interrupts guests too much,"I have only listened to one episode. Very interesting, important topics, but please let the guests talk!"
5,Talks too much,"Guests are great, and do like the host but she is to overbearing."
1,Ramblings of Jameela,A podcast for all who love Jameela talk about herself for an hour or so.
2,Let the guests speak!,"Interesting subject matter / love the choice of guests, but please let the guests speak! It feels like the podcast is always about the host. Eg Jameela frequently says ‘WE do this’ or ‘YOU AND I do that’ in relation to her guests - I understand that she is trying to relate to people but I’d prefer it if she just let each episode be about its guest and their experience, rather than that of the host."
3,Bulldozes the conversation ALOT.... stop doing this and it would be great.,"Amazing guests, insightful and interesting conversations, I really like Jameela on the whole -  it’s just SUCH a shame that Jameela is constantly cutting guests short and seemingly “knowing all”. Not the most open and curious interview style I’m afraid - once you’ve noticed it, it becomes quite unbearable to listen to. 

Steinem for example was a very gracious and patient listener, but it was quite an uncomfortable listen as she couldn’t get a word in edgeways. Bulldozes the conversation."
5,Amazing 😍😍😍,"I LOVE this podcast, it has genuinely kept me sane in lockdown, and Jameela is an absolute queen.
One thing that’s bothered me is the start of the Neal Brennan ep. he tells the story of meeting Jameela and says he was going “to put the moves on her” til he realized he was a fan of her boyfriend’s music. So he didn’t respect their relationship til he respected him? Honestly I’m surprised she wasn’t more bothered by that, seemed really creepy to me."
5,So in love with this podcast 🥰,"With every new podcast I come away feeling more inspired and knowledgeable than the last. Jameela is so relatable for me and always has been since her T4 times - the openness of topics regarding eating disorders, mental health and abortion have recently made me feel strong enough to talk openly about my own experiences in all of these and couldn’t thank her enough. I truly recommend to anyone who loves a good and factly feminist rant as well as learning about different cultures and perspectives which is beautifully knitted between her and her guests life stories. 

It’s like I’m getting a warm hug whenever I’m listening to this podcast and in this second lockdown in the UK, it’s very much welcomed."
3,I love you but,I am a huge fan of Jameela and all her work but I had to stop listening to this podcast as she just talks too much! Sadly of all her skills - interviewing is not one of them. I get she interviews people that resonate with her and her journey but it would be so good to hear much more from them. Got herself as well as others... I just can’t listen anymore as I find it a tad frustrating and don’t want to fall out of love with her.
5,Amazing 100% recommend,Did you not read the title? Go listen!
5,Wow,"This podcast has helped me grow in so many ways. Listen to it allll please. Especially Alok 😍😍😍

The important conversations had, topics covered, truths shared, the unlocking of issues, identifying where our shame lies and the dismantling of toxic ideology and lies, are just a few of the reasons I tune in every week.

I am often baffled with the world and how it goes round. How we are so consumed in all the things that are toxic and how we think we should be a certain was and how we as humans learn to hate ourselves and other so easily. I often speak to my partner about things and have an internal dialogue but I don’t feel that many people in my circle are interested in these kinds of conversations or understand how toxic the world can be without us knowing..and you get left feel as though there’s little hope of change. 

BUT THEN.... Jameela Jamil started this podcast  and the iweigh movement and here it is. The big conversation is happening amongst a community of listeners, celebrities, activists, young people, old people and it’s getting bigger. This give me so much joy.

The guests have so much to give and reflect on. There are so many perspectives to be shared. So much diversity and so much championing for standing up and being yourself and being better to other people. 

Love love love ❤️"
3,Amazing topics but the guests don’t speak much,"I really like Jameela and the conversations topics are exactly the kind of thing that needs to be discussed, however in a lot of episodes Jameela seems to talk for the same amount of time as the guests, or longer. You can feel the guests (eg Demi, Rees, Vivek, Katherine Ryan) deciding not to say things because Jameela has spoken over when it’s actually not her area of expertise at all. I am interested in hearing her opinions and I love her, but if you’re listening to hear the points of view of the guests and their lived experiences, you might be annoyed. If you just love Jameela and want to hear as much as poss from her then you’ll love it!"
4,Demi ep,"I love this podcast & have a huge amount of respect for Jameela. The Demi L ep is so so interesting. However, the host talks over and interrupts the guest constantly- often going on monologues about her opinion & experience. I really value her opinion and POV but not when she is hosting :)"
5,The most woke and enlightening podcast I’ve heard!!!,"In every episode I’m learning something new which is broadening my knowledge and improving my mental health. 

One suggestion though, please could you bring Matt Haig onto the podcast??? He would be great for the show and for listeners mental health. He’s also really interesting. 🙏🏻😂

Thanks 😊"
5,The BEST podcast out there to day,Jameela has outdone herself with this podcast. She is an amazing host and her guests are just perfect. It is so educational and insightful and I learn so much from listening to her guests talk about their personal stories and experiences. Every topic which SHOULD be talked about is covered here. Thank you Jameela!
4,Love the podcast,"I especially loved Demi Lovato’s episode, however there were numerous occasions where Demi would start speaking or telling a story to be interrupted and you could hear how she was put off of what she was saying which was a bit frustrating to hear."
5,I Weigh is *everything,"I cannot stress how good I think this podcast is. As a self-professed left leaning, woke (caucasian, gay, cis-male) listener I consider myself schooled, educated and my mind stretched by each episode. 

Practically the sound and vibe of the show is on point. 

Jameela dances through the most complex subject matters with ease and relatability. I literally feel like this podcast makes me a better person on this planet. 

Couldn’t recommend any more 👏🏼"
5,Amazing!!,These are some of most insightful and educational podcasts I have ever listened to. I highly recommend them to everyone! Just amazing!
5,Brilliant!!!,"Have listened to several of these now and am loving them. The one with Munroe Bergdorf though - wow!!! She is such an amazing woman, love how much you showed up for her Jameela."
5,Fantastic!,"As an avid podcast listener, I must say that this is one of my favourite of all time! I love how relatable Jameela is and the variety of guests she has are brilliant - a real eye opener to some serious topics and I feel I am getting an education as well as being entertained each week. Please keep up the good work Jameela, you make my day each week with this wonderful podcast ❤️x"
5,Great podcast,I love listening to this and learning about new things!
1,Please let your guest speak,Jameela repeatedly talks over her guest and makes the interview about herself. Frustrating to listen to.
5,The most engaging guests + conversations,This podcast gives you the opportunity to engage with a wide range of issues that are often neglected/ignored/mistreated in the mainstream media. The guests are always so interesting and the conversation is always refreshing and truthful with no holding back.
3,Good guests,"Love the guests and the potential behind, but I really wish Jameela would let them be the star! She talks over and cuts off everyone! Listening to Munroe be silenced was really uncomfortable listening at times."
5,Munroe ep x,"Adore adore this - so informative, have learnt TONS. Thank you so so much. Only small thing is did feel a bit like Jameela was talking over and for Munroe and not really allowing her to speak as much as other guests (probably bcos they’re good friends and she knows M’s story too)!"
5,You need this podcast in your life,"End of. You need to listen to this. It’s so informative, so interesting, so educational and so enjoyable. Just listen to it all, binge now"
5,Just love!,"I absolutely love listening to I weigh. It’s just such a beautiful podcast! I love hearing every amazing story. Some make me laugh like a crazy person whilst I walk my dog and others can really bring a tear to your eye and make you want to right all the wrongs. I just wanted to hug both Billy and Scarlet when they told their stories. 
Thank you for such honest, thought provoking stories."
5,Enjoying stories,I’ve been enjoying all the stories and experiences from different people. Glad we are normalizing them. I do with host would stop cutting off the guests mid sentence or mid story. Maybe letting them finish would make it even better and take it to the next level.
5,THANK YOU!,"Cannot thank you enough, love your podcast! Especially not shying away from the fact that women often perpetuate issues we’re facing. It’s so important to carry on these conversations. You weigh absolute tons to all of us for what you do, and for being true to who you are, especially as it’s not always making you popular. Lots of love! x"
5,Honesty,Love this. Love how honest it
5,Empowering,Every time I listen to this podcast I come away feeling so much more positive and powerful. The way Jameela talks about mental health is so accessible and accepting. I love it. My new favourite for sure.
5,Thought provoking and uplifting,"Only just got around to this and I’m really happy I decided to give it a go. Not a huge podcast listener usually but episode one down. Felt like I was sitting in on a conversation with friends and took away some really positive insights. Lockdown weight is real and this first episode has helped me feel more comfortable, I could also relate to so many things discussed. Thank you for being fresh!"
5,Thank you,"What a brilliant, honest conversation about mental health with Scarlet Curtis. We need more people like you in the world!"
3,Enjoying,"I’m really excited about this podcast and it’s guests, however, I have found that they are. A little host heavy and of course there’s so much to say but I think when there’s a rare and super interesting guest it’s a shame when they are cut off from a story mid sentence or story... that’s been frustrating really."
5,Loved it.,"Listened to the episode with Aisling Bea and I really loved the wit, laughter and honesty from both ladies.  Soo intelligent and thought provoking chat!"
5,Amazing!!!,"If you are looking for an authentic, real conversation between Jameela and her guests, then this is the one for you! For those who are saying that she is a man hating feminist, she is merely addressing the issues that women and minority groups often face that others are afraid to acknowledge.

This is an essential listen for those who aren’t in denial. I love that this covers an array of issues and includes a variety of guests representing different industries and communities. Will be continuing to listen!!!"
3,Elly27495,"Great podcast and format, however she does talk over her guests and doesn’t let them fully finish their points. This makes it a frustrating listen sometimes."
5,Essential listening,"I don’t feel as though I’m listening to an interview, it’s more like listening to two friends have an insightful conversation and Jameela has invited us to the table."
5,Iconic,The only complaint I have about this podcast is hate I am seeing towards it in the comments section. Jameela is incredibly well spoken and down to earth. Each interview feels so genuine and touches on issues that our generation need to speak about. Genuinely think I may have lost count of the amount of times I have punched my hand in the air and said “yes!” in reaction to things that both Jameela and her guests have said. I would give it a ten stars if I could!
5,The most incredible podcast,"I absolutely adore this podcast! The topics covered by such strong, inspirational women leave me constantly wanting to hear more.

I’m addicted and can’t wait to hear more!

Jameela is the finest host, bringing humour, sensitivity but also a relatability to even the most difficult topics. Im in love!"
3,Not for me,"I love listening to empowered women but this podcast doesn’t do it for me. Jameela seems to hate the world and men and rather than celebrate the world we live in, I found everything she discusses brings up the same patriarchal issues. Tried to listen to a few as admire a lot of the guests she has and wanted to listen what they have to say. Instead we are met with all the horrible and cruel things men do to control the showbiz industry.

Jameela interviews in a way where she tells a story and then hints at the guest to give their own opinion but because the story has created an extreme view of lack of opportunities for women, it would be outrageous if the women did not agree. Let them lead with their own opinions and then give yours, it would create a more genuine feel to the podcast."
5,Incredible.,Jameela is such a breath of fresh air. I adore her honesty and look forward to her iweigh podcasts every week. Really loved all of them so far. Feel like I learn so much from these women and constantly inspiring me to let go of my insecurities. Thankyou!! Everyone needs to listen.
1,It’s not all about you,"Brilliant guests and the makings of an excellent podcast.... if only the host would stop talking over the guests and constantly trying to make everything all about her. It’s unprofessional, irritating and downright rude."
5,"Informative, insightful, funny, calming - 100% worth a listen","I’ve found this podcast to be a little slice of calm in very uncertain/ anxiety inducing times. So far Jameela has had a great variety of guests who all have really insightful and interesting things to say on topics varying from body positivity, cancel culture, the concept of shame, and deconstructing patriarchal assumptions. 

The overriding theme is to be kinder to yourself and to not derive your self esteem from what is often quite an artificial and damaging social media. 
The issues she addresses could not be more prevalent than in a time of global pandemic in which we are geographically isolated from one another - forcing many of us to become more introspective and self-reflecting. 

I really look forward to each new episode as it comes out every week, and always come away with a big smile on my face after listening. ♥️"
1,Not for me!,Super annoying host bringing everything down to her 6th form level feminist agenda. Not intelligent nor funny. A pity really as I am a massive fan of Aisling Bea but I couldn’t finish this.
5,Thank you Jameela,"Jameela is reeeeal and I like it. When Instagram and publications are saturated with pressure to change yourself Jameela encourages you to enjoy your life and embrace yourself

Really grateful Jameela’s making so much content at the moment and can’t wait to see other changes she influences next"
5,Loving it!!,"I’ve listened to all the podcasts so far and I’m loving them! My favourite was Demi’s, purely because I loved the rawness of the conversation and how you were both able to be so comfortable to share how you feel. Definitely going to continue to listen to them because I love them. 
Keep it up Jameela! ❤️"
5,Love it!!!!,"I love your podcast!!! It’s the only thing keeping me going and giving me hope! I’m trying to love myself and love my body- it’s hard but I will get there. I’m so grateful for your podcast!!!🥺 I’m obsessed!! love it!! it’s my new therapy. You are outspoken and speak TRUTH!! I admire you so much!  Please don’t ever stop making your podcast, it has helped me massively. THANK YOU JAMELLA!!! so grateful to have a woman like you in the world who’ stands up for herself and make the world a better place xx 
Hope you see this xx 
From (Tabs from Twitter) xx"
3,Good but too much interrupting of guests,"I think the topics discussed so far are brilliant and very interesting/ inspiring but it’s the talking over and cutting off guests mid sentence at times that can be a little bit annoying/ disjointed at times but on the whole, it’s a good podcast and will be a staple in my library!"
3,Talks over the interviewee,"Enjoyed listening to Aishling Bea, she’s funny and insightful, but I find Jamil’s interview style irritating. She quite often talks over Aishling. Annoying."
5,absolutely brilliant!,I think I just found my new favourite podcast❤️
5,Thank you for this,"A breath of fresh air. Amazing inspiration in terms of your Christian faith and being real about who you are whilst being a Christian (no glossy image) 
I love it - so healing and beautiful words. Thank you both for sharing yourselves very openly."
5,Empowering,"During these uncertain times this podcast was exactly what I have been searching for.  The interviews are incredible, insightful and grounding. Thank you for such a rich production of knowledge and insight of film, TV and media but also of the people that represent the fantasy’s we invest our lives watching. I forget that the people behind the cameras are human too and more alike than different to you or I."
1,Give it a miss,Many better pods exploring these issues. Amateur effort from an unqualified c list celeb. Avoid
5,So brilliant.,Needed this in my life! Always feel much better about life after listening to an episode of this. Big up Jameela 👌
5,Fabulous,Such an insightful podcast thank you.  You shine a light in places I had not thought about.  You are a great interviewer.  Thank you.  Keep well
3,Good podcast but could be improved,"I love you Jameela Jamil and your vision however interrupting your guests quite frequently and interjecting your own stories has made me not want to listen anymore, you’re not the guest I was drawn to the podcasts for the interview with the guests but they don’t get much chance to speak at length."
5,Loved it 👍❤️,This podcast is incredibly insightful and thought provoking as well as being hilarious. Jameela is incredibly well-versed and empathetic. Definitely worth a listen!
5,Amazingly relaxed and honest,"If you are at all interested in people, society, mental health or body image - you should listen to this. It is so refreshing to hear people speaking so openly about a variety of experienced"
4,Refreshing,"I love Jameela and her attitude, I know she’s being real, but if she could just keep the F word limited then I can listen to it freely in front of the kids!!"
4,Great podcast - work on interruptions,"Love the podcast, great guests and really fascinating issues discussed. Jameela is such a well informed and empathetic interviewer. My one niggle is that she semi often interrupts interviewees preemptively. Often these interruptions are her interjecting with her personal stories and experience (all be them interesting). There is definitely a place for her rich personal experience on the podcast, but it would be great to gently probe and truly listen to her guests first and foremost. I understand this may be difficult via Skype calls!"
5,"Incredible, inspiring and Ideal for the lockdown","The topics and themes are so well thought out, amazing guests, and Jameela Jamil is so honest and hilarious on this. (Great theme tune too - I love it very much)"
5,Excellent,Bravo! Just listened to the first two. Beanie’s interview is fantastic particularly about body image issues and now she’ll possibly have to change her name thanks to Aussie slang. I was like a sponge listening to Vivek’s interview. So many really important points made. I love how Jameela is totally herself and brings her sharp wit but also personal stories and insights to the table. Looking forward to hearing more.
5,Brilliant,The loneliness episode is so well done. Brilliant 👏🏻
5,I love this so much! ❤️,"I love the way Jameela connects with the people she is interviewing and with me as a listener. Been following Jameela’s IG and iweigh IG and find them so inspiring.
Can’t wait to hear more!❤️❤️xx"
5,i weigh,I love you and everything you do. I weigh many things but today i weigh listening to you ♥️
5,I am WOWED,This is truly eye-opening and made me feel much less alone. Thank you for putting this out here! More power to you both⚡️
5,Love Jameela,Super inspiring. Lovely idea Jameela
5,Must listen!,What a great podcast Jameela’s brought! Amazing concept and loved the episode with Beanie and all the topics you all tackled. Love it!❤️
5,❤️,"i love this! thank you for sharing your experience, it means so much to me ❤️"
4,please listen more,this podcast is good and you have good message but please listen more to your guests and try to not cut off
5,Exceptional podcast,"Extremely human, vulnerably gorgeous entertainment, educating and opening up my mind to many new and important topics, thank you!"
5,Love this podcast 🌼,"i look forward to every new episode , Jameela seems to bring more interesting guests every week :)"
5,"Fantastic content, host & guests",Excellent choice of guests - each a very interesting person with perspective-shifting viewpoints on really interesting content. I am learning so much from Jameela and her guests and I hope this podcast continues for a really long time.
5,The best podcast to expand your horizons,"...and have a laugh! Brilliant selection of guests and frank conversations with an honest, clever and funny host. Every episode challenges listeners to become a bit more aware, to question their own prejudices and preconceptions, to think about ways we can all contribute to dismantling systems of oppression. Thank you Jameela for all your work. Keep it up!"
5,The best podcast of all podcasts ever!,"This podcast is life changing. At times it’s the only thing that keeps me going. I often feel understood on things I never thought I would. Several moments, when Jameela shared what she’s been through, became my salvation. Therefore I can confidently say, the world is lucky to have Jameela Jamil."
5,uno dei migliori podcast mai ascoltati,"ho scoperto questo podcast perché la hoster , jameela è una delle mie attrici preferiti nella ironica e sarcastica serie , the good place .
questo podcast tratta a mio parere di temi molto attuali e di cui bisognerebbe discutere ogni giorno apertamente senza avere paura di nessun ti possa giudicare per quello che stai dicendo e niente , adoro questo post . keep on jameela ❤️"
3,"Much needed, but how well is it executed?","I like this podcast, but it would be fantastic if Jamil stopped talking about herself and actually let the interviewees talk. I sometimes find it embarrassing."
5,A bright star amongst darkness,"If there’s a podcast that had to be made, this is it and no one could have done it better than the one and only Jameela Jamil. 
Do yourself a favor and listen to it."
5,Inspiring and necessary,I want to thank you for keeping this podcast going. I have learnt so much from this podcast. There are such few strong female voices who are uplifting and generally try to understand the realities of general people.
4,Love,"Love the show!
Please just check the photo of your guest Sarah Jones posted with the episode The Sex Industry. It doesn’t seem accurate to me…"
5,The best,My favourite podcast ever. Inspiring and encouraging.
5,Cream of the crop,"Fucking queen, mate. Nough said innit?"
5,Inspiring,This podcast is so inspiring and listening to it is the highlight of my week 🥺🥺
5,Wholesome!,"This podcast is so inspiring and heartwarming. I would say that it feels like a conversation with a friend who completely gets you.
Looking forward to the rest!"
5,More please!,"This first episode was so inspiring, very much looking forward to the rest!"
5,Thought provoking,"I am always looking out for an enjoyable insightful, thought provoking podcast, and this hits all those buttons! I love playing this in earshot of my pre teen son who asks thoughtful questions about the issues discussed. An important conversation starter."
1,Disappointing,"I used to really enjoy this podcast, but as time goes on I have come to realise that Jameela is actually toxic and problematic. She is just using the plight of others for self serving purposes and for attention. She really confirmed this for me when she supported Will Smith committing an act of violence and in the episode with JVN made me cry, she was so vile to them. 
If you are struggling with any mental health issues, I would suggest that you listen to podcasts that are put together by actual experts, not some C lost celebrity just trying to raise their profile. This podcast will ruin your day, it is so negative and not at all helpful to anyone. I would rate this a zero, but that’s not possible, so I give it a one."
5,One of my favourite pods!,"I adore this podcast. I love Jameela’s insight and perception of the world around her. Her guests are from such a wide variety of backgrounds and have such unique and powerful views on lots of different topics. Very educational and inspiring, a must listen."
4,I really like this podcast and would love it if…,"I really like Jameela a lot. She has a wonderful heart and so much compassion and honesty. I think her podcasting skills would be strengthened if she got some active listening training in holding space for her guests rather than cutting in with what she wants to say. You’re shutting off the gold, Jameela. Silence is a powerful tool. There’s so much value and love in this podcast and it could be extraordinary with some tweaks. Thank you for all your hard work, emotional labour, and bringing yourself fully to us."
5,5/5 pod but LET THEM SPEAK,This is an amazing podcast but at times the host doesn’t let her guests speak... she just keeps talking and talking :( as with the case where Marina was on
5,Subscribe now!,Brilliant!!
3,"Great guests, good topics, poor hosting","I love the guests, I love the topics of mental health etc and gives a new insight into these famous people’s lives. But please please jameela stop interrupting your guests and inserting yourself. Listening is much more then waiting for your turn to speak (and sometimes you don’t do that). Please learn and do better. Such a shame, could be phenomenal."
5,My favourite podcast,"Absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for being so open minded and curious, these conversations deserve all the attention they can get."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this podcast 💓 I feel like I’m learning so much while being entertained by Jameela and her great guests! You’re amazing Jameela, thank you for this podcast xx"
5,What we all need to hear,"Eyeopening, thought provoking, funny and honest. Very empowering and just and an amazing podcast by amazing, strong and brave women."
5,👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,"Was ambivalent about clicking on this but turns out I needed to hear it! Give it a go.... It was thoughtful, funny, casual and genuine. Awesome women ❤️👩‍🎤"
5,Genious,Love everything about this show
5,Love,Love
5,Outstanding,"This podcast is great! Every young woman should have a chance to listen to it. Many important subjects are touched and discussed, well done!"
5,Great podcast,I really enjoy listening to this podcast ! It’s so much needed and I really can relate to a lot of subjects ❤️
5,😍,I needed that! So positive 😍
5,Brilliant,"Love the guests, love the host, the topics are all acute and need to be amplified. I want a podcast discussing this podcast 🙌🏻"
5,Thanks,"Every episode is so brilliant, I just can’t get enough. However usually I’m  not into this genre of experience-sharing-interviews. Also Jameela’s voice and English pronounciation is really soothing. Greetings from 🇷🇺"
5,Fav podcast!!,"I don’t usually leave reviews on podcast app, but I’ve been listening to Jameela Jamil for a really long time and it’s just been amazing. She’s incredibly humble, and she approaches every topic with the attitude to learn. and most importantly, she is so unapologetically herself and this inspires me to be unapologetically myself. I love how excited she is about her guests and how she jokes with them. It makes the heavy topics feel slightly lighter, but doesn’t totally remove the seriousness of them. I listened to this podcast when I drive and just before I sleep. Or sometimes when I feel like I need to be grounded this is the one I go for. Thank you, Jameela Jamil you are awesome!"
5,What we all need,Thank you for being such a refreshing listen! Your podcast with trapyogabae had me crying. Thank you thank you thank you
5,A Must Watch for sure!,Really love her podcast! :)
5,Where can I find the subscripts?,Where can I find the subscripts?
5,Jameela you are an inspiration.,"I love your podcast. It's raw, relatable and educational.
I learn a lot from you Jameela."
5,The best!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,I wanna meet Mindy Karling in this show plzzzz
5,Like a big sister I never had,"Jameela distills complex topics into accessible, beautifully worded conversations, grounded in the recognition of human flawedness. As a 20-something year old, this podcast is a treasure — a door to self-awareness and a tool for navigating the challenges of womanhood."
5,Great podcast,"Great podcast, interesting guests. Love it!"
5,Wish I would’ve found this podcast sooner!,"This is literally the best podcast series I’ve ever listen to. I love that the language used is how actual people talk to one another and nothing is too embarrassing to talk about. Thank you so much for keeping it real, thought-provoking, and educating.❤️🙌🏻"
5,Best host!,"My favourite podcast!! Any episode I choose to listen to, I’m always sure I’ll get new insights and it will open my mind more and more. Jameela is so smart and funny, the best host! Thank you <3"
5,Love it,"Fantastic and important topics, with a lot of humor. Jameela is a great host. I wish this was something I could have listened to in my twenties but I’ll take it in my thirties as well. Also I wanna marry Beanie. Side note."
5,Love,Absolutely love the episode with Conan O’Brien.
5,my fav podcast,i just love it
5,Helpful in every way!,"Insightful, and painfully honest. Really challenges you to questions your own biases and beliefs about everything and encourages personal work and growth. Thank you, JAMEELA and guests! X"
5,actual best,"genuinely one of the best podcasts, i enjoy going on long car rides and listening to this podcast. i would love more famous guests."
5,❤️❤️,Love this podcast  big fan
2,Just because you’re famous…,"… doesn’t mean you’re interesting. I guess for some people, those two words are synonymous. Being famous also doesn’t mean you know what you’re talking about. 

These are not everyday, average people. They’re rich celebrities. They’re not in touch with actual real life. They don’t have the same problems as us and they certainly don’t know how to fix mental health issues. (My food budget for the next 6 days is negative $4. My OCD is so bad that I’ve started memorizing the periodic table in an attempt to keep intrusive thoughts at bay. I can’t afford a specialized therapist, ketamine treatment or even organic chamomile tea, for that matter). This podcast is just glossy, superficial quackery."
5,Great relationship guidance,"Great conversation coming from younger people who share important tips they have learned from their intimate relationships. Also, more conversation is needed directed toward males to help process their feelings."
3,Wanted to like it,But I can’t hang. Somehow feels like she is on a high horse speaking down on many topics in many situations.
5,9/3/24 episode,"Yeah. Shove that in your Forgiveness Pipe and cram it in a pulpit. 
You know who you are and what you did 😤"
5,Fantastic!,This pod has been recommended to me many times and I am so glad that I finally started listening!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5,Important and Interesting,A+ content on all the interesting topics. Just listen- you’ll love it.
5,Jameela Is A Treasure,Jameela is making history and I’m thankful for her. Is she perfect? No. Do I always agree with everything she says? No. But the wide array of topics she covers and her compassion and bravery are unmatched. She is truly a treasure.
5,*****,Great podcast!
3,"An interesting interviewer, but","She sometimes doesn’t rly internalize what her guests are talking about when they’re from disenfranchised groups she can’t personally relate to. She’s a lovable tryhard, she asks good questions of interesting guests and leaves them tons of space to respond without speaking over them. But if you read recent guest Clementine Morrigan’s sub stack, who just last month was concern trolling about trans kids and has been engaging with transphobes before by lending a “legitimizing” queer voice to their obvi phobic show? You get the sense that while Jameela Jamil wants there to be better discourse, she’s more interested in defending a bigot’s right to speak than, say, protecting the communities they are attacking. Jamil’s work walks a fine line, there’s bound to be missteps and she’s open about it, but why ask Natalie Wynn on if you’re not rly going to listen to her? It’s hard not to listen to ppl and cherry pick whatever confirms your own biases without challenging those biases, but Jamil says that is what her job is. So she should do that job."
2,Disinformation,"I’ve listened to this podcast for years and have mostly really enjoyed it, but in the recent episode “Unpacking Pop Psychology w/Seerut K. Chawla” Jameela makes several inaccurate and harmful statements about autism/autistic people while using outdated, ableist and antisemitic terminology and functioning labels. I would normally assume a person speaking this way is just uneducated, but she’s had multiple autistic guests on the podcast in the past year to speak specifically about autism. It feels difficult to believe she didn’t learn or internalize why her statements are problematic while researching for those episodes or during the episodes themselves. As an autistic person, I’m disappointed and simply don’t feel comfortable listening to a podcast that perpetuates this kind of disinformation."
5,Jameela Jamil for President,"I listened to the episode of Podcrushed where Jameela more or less interviewed Penn and I just needed more of her. She’s quick witted, so incredibly intelligent, seems to have a wonderful sense of humor — and those words don’t even begin to describe how amazing her soul is. I absolutely adore this woman and find myself more times than not nodding along as she speaks on various issues with her guests, or even outwardly and enthusiastically saying “yes” during these conversations. Jameela is astonishing. Her guests are superb. If I could give this podcast four trillion stars, I absolutely would."
5,This pod is a must-listen,"Only a few episodes in and LOVING the takes, the guests, everything. On the ‘cancelled’ episode right now and Jameela said something that I keep coming to as a teacher - kids are seeing what people say online and how we treat each other and they ARE bringing this to the classroom. I hear too many awful interactions that didn’t happen even a few years ago because even teenagers don’t see the difference. This is harmful and heartbreaking. Thank you for calling out the grown ups and reminding us how we need to behave to set a better example. We all deserve more humanity."
5,Challenging and comforting at the same time,"The array of guests on this podcast are fantastic and I can really feel the drive Jameela has for understanding and exploring other peoples experiences. Jameela is doing important, validating work in this space but also isn’t afraid of challenging topics."
1,almost,"wrong babe, we do not need men. we can absolutely take the power for ourselves."
1,Not true,No credentials lots of fake news cited
4,Great guests,"This podcast has some fantastic guests, who are funny, sparkling, and informed at talking about their areas of specialization. I have listened to several of the episodes. The host asks penetrating questions. One piece of feedback is that the host could listen to her guests instead of talking over, interrupting, or speaking for them. The episode with the dynamic and exhilirating Amanda Seales is difficult to listen to at times because of this issue."
5,Thank you!,"Thank you, Jameela. I loved you in The Good Place and on IG but now that I have listened to “Invisible Illnesses with Meghan O’Rourke, I am inspired! As a fellow hEDS-er, thank you for saying so clearly everything I’ve been feeling. I’m loosing forward to reading Meghan’s book."
5,Refreshing and so needed,"Listening to Jameela speak about literally anything is like drinking water and breathing air. This podcast has sincerely improved my quality of life. As someone with hEDS and a whole host of related medical conditions, I listened to this most recent episode multiple times because it was just so *good for the soul* to hear two fabulous women with hEDS chat about their lives! Thank you for everything Jameela. And thank you to all the like-minded people out there for keeping this show on the air."
5,Why did I wait so long to listen?!?,I have known about this podcast forever and finally started listening. I am binging it like crazy - thank you Jameela for talking about everything! 🥰
5,Great Host! Great Guests!,There hasn’t been an episode I haven’t enjoyed or haven’t learned from. Thank you. THIS is meaningful
5,"Fantastic, superb, lovely","Jameela, I am so grateful to you for sharing your wisdom and your heart. You are like the healthy friend I so desperately need. thank you a million times over for your transparency. You are such a role model and inspiration to me 🤍"
5,My favorite,One of my absolute favorites. Jameela has important conversations about developmental trauma ( childhood trauma) with real down -to -earth conversations. She’s a much needed voice in the mental health space! 💜
5,Rachel Bloom,"Just found out about this podcast because I’m a huge fan of Rachel Bloom. Really enjoyed it, definitely going to listen to more."
5,"Thoughtful, funny, and educational",I look forward to listening to new episodes every week because I always walk away learning something new. I am so appreciative of the anti shame approach to every topic covered.
1,One star for Aubrey Gordon,"I realize the Jameela Jamil is an actress. She’s not a scientist, she does not have any credentials at all, but she did at least claim to be against diet culture. Imagine my surprise when she has “glucose goddess” on the show. I thought it was a joke for a minute. This woman actually recommends that people drink apple cider vinegar. So instead of just enjoying a cookie completely worry, free, I can instead pair it with an ulcer in my esophagus and less enamel on my teeth. This platform claimed to be a safe space but instead is encouraging incredibly problematic behaviors around eating. So disappointed, I will definitely be unsubscribing!"
5,Excellent,"I have listened to three episodes and am blown away by Jameela’s intellect, thoughtfulness, honesty, and creativity. Very impressive. I look forward to listening to more."
5,F*#% the patriarchy,"I adore this podcast. When I feel so sad and defeated by the state of our society that I just want to run away and live in the woods like a feral cat, I give this a listen and suddenly I feel like the Kool-Aid man right after he busts through a stranger's wall, ready to rejoin the fight. Thank you, Jameela, for never giving up the fight. Your energy is so very much needed in this sick world."
4,Great,I am so happy I came across this podcast. It’s certainly interesting.
5,Thank you for identifying narcissistic behavior so we stop allowing it,"You have brought so much light of what to look for and how to get out if you’re in a toxic relationship, and how to see the red flags in order prevent getting sucked in again."
5,Wow.,"My goodness, Jameela! What a powerhouse you are. 

Although I’m your age, I listen to The View’s podcast daily (lol), and hearing you on there was the first time I got exposure to you outside of your acting work. I was impressed by how well-spoken and thoughtful you are, and as soon as I learned of a way to continue listening to you, I immediately subscribed to this podcast. 

I’m currently listening to the Sam Sanders episode (love you, Sam!) and you are absolutely brilliant! You’re a wonderful interviewer, a fabulous speaker, intelligent, and your heart seems so pure. I’m so grateful to The View for helping me (and I’m sure numerous others) to find your podcast! 

Thanks for the great work you’re doing. 💝"
5,100%,Jamel’s thank you for being yourself. I celebrate you (possibly idolize a little) and honor what you bring to the world. All my love. Thirteen thank yous. Thirteen thank yous. 💚 jocela mae Crawford
5,I love Jameela and I love this podcast,"Thank you so much, you add so much light to the world. The interviews are fascinating, varied and very fun to listen to!"
5,such a great show,so informative (
5,Very interesting,"This show is generally very interesting and engaging, but the episode on narcissism was SO GOOD. Such an important conversation to be having, and the style pulls you right in."
5,Inspiring,This podcast always makes me feel better about life!
1,Affluent Women Whine About Society,"Your typical modern-day feminist clap-trap. The patriarchy is keeping women down, despite the fact that more women graduate college than men, and make more money. Completely out-of-touch the average person. Depressing topics. If you're feeling a little down, don't listen to this podcast. You might just end it all."
5,"Not perfect, but still my favorite","Jameela, you’re wonderful. Thank you for trying to break so many molds in Hollywood, being as unrestrained and genuine as you can be, and for talking about topics other celebrities shy away from. Thanks for not being scared of being “cancelled”, and saying the truth. I agree, sometimes you bulldoze convos and talk over guests, but I can tell you’ve been working on it. Love love love love you. (Obsessed with the Cindy episode/real sex, Ricki Lake and Abby/birth control, and more)."
2,Bleh,"Let your guests speak without the constant interruption, yo. It’s so cringey that I can’t listen anymore."
1,Brutal,"One of the more depressing, low energy, man-hating podcasts out there. I can’t imagine what tired, lonely soul is listening to this bore of a podcast.  Come on women, be entertaining. This is bad, real bad."
1,Unlistenable,"Jameela Jamil is a shrill, nasty, deplorable harpy. The fact that she is famous for anything other than what she looks like reflects dismally on our society."
1,Rich women tell you how to live.,Narcissistic rich women explain how normal people are wrong for trying to survive while working a 9-5. Hopefully mental illness will take this podcast soon.
1,Phony,She is such a phony and this podcast will make you dumbers.
5,I bet you'll love this,"After just one episode of this podcast, I have completely changed my way of thinking about what I weigh, literally and figuratively 

Throw your bloody scale away and work on how you can find one thing to make yourself happier every day. Thanks, Jameela and all who work so hard on this exceptional podcast 
I love you"
5,Fabulous,"Fabulous podcast. Interesting, informative, and relevant."
1,Used to love this podcast,Platforming Tyler Henry and folks spreading misinformation about birth control has done it for me. I’m very disappointed as a long time fan of the podcast and of Jameela Jamil
5,I weigh,"I love Jameela. She has not only helped me with body issues, but also with cutting out toxic people. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
5,Great Ambiance,"“Feel good” and/but thought provoking podcast. Time well spent, always!!"
1,Psychics are scam artists.,"I’m a big supporter of JJ and always will be - her heart is unquestionably in the right place, but ultimately, I unsubscribed today after she brought on a psychic - psychics are scam artists who prey on people’s suffering and often cause major financial and personal damage. If you’ve ever been critical of Joe Rogan for allowing guests to spread dangerous ideas, then you have to be critical of her as well. Bringing on a psychic undermines the credentials of the medical professionals she’s also brought on the show and places them on the same playing field. JJ always talks about using her high profile responsibly, she’s not done so this time."
5,Love!!,She is a great interviewer and always discusses very important topics. My favorite podcast!
5,Great show!,"Jameela, host of the podcast, highlights all aspects of how important and interesting people manage their mental health and more in this can’t miss podcast!  The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
5,Fun Always (Especially Mike Schur Episode)!,"I love the vulnerability exhibited by both Jameela and her guests. The Mike Schur episode recently was so fun and sweet and funny! She talks with many guests who I haven’t known before, which is a great way to be exposed to new insights and cool people! Thanks Jameela! Your journey, honesty, and self reflection is lovely."
5,She actually cares,"Jameela is amazing just such a caring person who campions many who struggle to be heard, represented and respected. She’s like the girl in high school that sticks up for the unpopular kids without even caring or considering what the popular kids would say. I love her. The episode with JVN is incredible and had me crying on my way to work. Their interview was special."
5,"I love, feel supported, heard & learn from this show.","This show has helped me with my mental health journey. I appreciate the stigma breaking voice of Jameela and have learned so much and grown personally and emotionally from this content.

I also love the diverse guests. 

I can’t describe how what I’ve learned through listening has helped break old and harmful social ideas that have held me back in my life.

I can’t recommend enough! ❤️"
3,Let the guest speak,I want to like this podcast because there’s some great guest BUT Jameela doesn’t let her guests speak. I hear a lot of “I” when she’s speaking and she’s doesn’t let the guests finish a freaking thought!!! Let them speak and take a step back to actually “hear” what they are saying.
1,Another dangerous fat acceptance podcast,“Body positive” activists want everyone to be fat and unhealthy.
5,I love Jameela,I love what Jameela weighs!  She has introduced me to some gorgeous women who inspire and motivate me. She puts such positivity out into the world.  And I love how she does it while being so relatable and human and peppering in a few curse words. Love it!
5,One of my favorite podcasts,💕
5,Didn't know I needed this,"This is the podcast I didn't know I needed until I started listening to it. Jameela brings in so many guests with perspectives and life experiences that I wouldn't have been exposed to, and it has been really enlightening and helped me keep an open mind as I go through the world. Jameela is really putting some good into the world with this and her iWeigh movement overall."
5,Celebrate every Friday,"Seriously have more joy on the last day of the school/work week now because I know there is a new episode to join in on whenever I am ready. Have gotten my husband addicted to the shared laughs and learning on his work commute, too. This is the best coffee date with your favorite girlfriend and whoever she brings to the table. Keep up the great work!!! You are heard and appreciated!!!"
5,Iweigh,This podcast is worth every second.  It is priceless - an honest perception on our misogynistic culture.  The episode with Samantha Bee is a treasure and so inspiring!  Thank you!!!
3,LET THEM SPEAK,"Listened because she interviewed Natalie Wynn, depressed bc I didn’t get to hear much from Natalie Wynn. More of Jameela talking over an actual trans woman about trans & cis women’s struggles. I know she’s good intentioned but please please exercise some self restraint 🙏🏽"
3,I Listen… but Jameela doesn’t,"I want to love this podcast because I’m totally behind the movement and the conversations that need to be had, but Jameela… you need to stop interrupting and let the guests speak more. Almost every episode is more of you talking than the guests.
Often times they begin to fully develop the answer to your questions but then you bulldoze and attach a story with your own experience instead of hearing theirs out. It’s so apparent in every episode. I can feel the guests kind of thrown off and silent sometimes because it just takes a turn into the Jameela Show. I hope you take constructive criticism and allow your guests more time to speak and take time to just listen."
3,Changed my mind,This podcast used to be really empowering to women.  The last week’s episodes have been real soft balls. Rating is ehhhh.
5,Girl Crush,"Thank you Jameela. Thanks for your honesty, activism, humor, and willingness to go there, wherever there may be."
5,Breath of fresh air,"Always liked Jameela Jamil in the Good Place, was totally thrilled when she had on other women talking about the experience of chronic pain. Personally it was definitely the first time I could look at a celebrity (including the woman they had on to talk about her experiences; I’m blanking who it was) and see someone going through/went through the type of issue I am going through. Especially chronic illnesses are a taboo topic for women in some way. I feel like more upbeat (not doom mongering) discussion is necessary in our culture. Anyway, it’s a nice listen with lots of positive episodes."
5,Love Jameela so much!,This is the most calming educating lovely podcast! Love the guests and I would listen to Jameela solo too. Get it
5,Makes me happy,"Listening to Jameela makes me feel so happy and loving of myself and others, I love it and love her :) thank you Jameela!"
5,always worth listening to,"I love this podcast. Jameela is brilliant, funny, authentic and brings out the same in her guests. She centralizes topics that aren’t frequently discussed in pop culture, normalizes mental health conversations, and has super interesting people on from any number of backgrounds - both famous and well-known guests, as well as lesser known people who she feels ought to be given a platform. I always find her podcast worth listening to, even if it’s a topic i already know something about, because it goes deep and personal, giving me food for thought. Keep it up, Jameela!"
5,Down to Earth and Informative,"I love Jameela and the guests she brings on. For me, it’s a mix of people I love and people I’ve never heard of. Each person brings something different to the table and teaches their listeners something important. Highly recommend a listen ♥️"
5,A true Gem,"I stumbled across this when the host was on Demi’s podcast. I had only known her from “The Good Place”. But she is so much more than an actress, comedian and pretty face! This podcast speaks to all the issues people won’t/don’t talk about. Her blunt opinions resonate with me and gives me a better outlook on society. Love love love!!!!
PS i weigh two beautiful children who may or may not be addicted to Netflix, the ability to see the good In most anything (not nazis) a glass is half full attitude and bake a mean pie."
1,LOST ALL RESPECT FOR YOU JAMEELA,You should have done more to speak against the injustice against the Palestinian people. SHAME ON YOU.  Be the woman you pretend to be and make your living off of pretending to be. I expected so much more from you. You’re a fraud canceling all of my subscriptions and will never support anything your name is attached to. Completely disappointed.
5,Jameela rocks,And I want to be her friend!!
5,Thank you for a great podcast!,"Jameela, I love this podcast SO much. Your vulnerability and honesty make you totally relatable and I listen every week. I have not stopped thinking about what Natalie Morales was describing regarding ADHD in women. I had never even considered there might be an explanation for my procrastination, clutter, difficulty finishing projects, and interrupting, other than their being character flaws. I have something else to explore about myself now."
5,"Inspiring, informative, and inclusive",It’s like hanging out with a group of friends on Podcast.
5,Loved ! LoVeD!! LOVED Nikki Glaser!!,❤️❤️❤️MORE PLEASE!! ❤️❤️❤️
2,Why Even Have Guests?,"I so badly wanted to love this Podcast since I love Jameela so much, but I found it to be impossible to get through as she continually interrupts her guests with her own personal stories, sometimes in the middle of her guests responding to a question. For example, she will ask a question related to where an insecurity a guest has experienced stems from and Jameela will then interrupt mid-answer to share how SHE had something similar and how SHE pinpointed it, got over it, and her own takeaways from her own experience, then she moves on to another question. 

I was so excited to hear from Kelly Rowland but I feel as though I never got to listen to her finish her thoughts or share her complete story about her experiences. I truly believe I know more about Jameela than Kelly after listening to the interview.

I understand that Jameela’s personality is dominating, but I hope she goes back and listens to her own podcast episodes and tries to understand how to better move forward with these interviews. An interviewer should not usually be speaking more than the guest."
5,Niki Glasser ep,"The best, most honest guest. Very relatable story lines in her life and yours as well. I am in recovery from anorexia but very much still struggling. My life long battle. Today was a good day tho. Hopefully tomorrow will follow suit. 
Thanks for your pod💟"
5,More Gunter.,"Love your podcast. I especially love when you have Dr Gunter on. You should have her on at least once a quarter. She is in interesting and entertaining. Your other guests are great too, but she is especially awesome."
5,Thank you!,"I have been listening to this podcast since it’s beginning. Last year. I love to hear them! I listen with my son ( 18). We  just finished the Jane Fonda pod. She Is a brilliant person. I understand  your fan girl ideas. Rest assured, during the interview you were quite coherent.
It is ok to have emotions show. We Americans must be rubbing off on you."
3,"Love the aim of the pod, wish we could hear more from guests",I love the choices Jameela and team make with guests and topics. The podcast is addressing a key gap in public discourse. I respectfully suggest that the aims of the podcast would be more holistically achieved if the guests were given more space to speak - less interruption and less (well-intentioned) efforts to demonstrate how the host relates to the lived experience of the guest. Thank you!
5,Thank you,"This podcast brings strength, inspiration, and reminders about what truly matters! It is the most meaningful podcast I listen to."
5,Love this so so much!!,Jameela is first off an INCREDIBLE person! Her story is beautiful and inspiring and motivational and makes it feel like your not alone :) The topics she addresses are so important and having a podcast about it is amazing!! I can't get enough of it and she teaches about so many important things while still doing it in an entertaining way!
5,I just love her,"Jameela is one of those people that I’m just happy to be alive at the same time as. So much of what she says really resonates with me; I feel like she’s a best friend in my ear agreeing with me that the world is horrible, and also still worth trying to survive in. She’s also just really funny and I like her a lot. Thankful for her podcast."
5,Jameela Jamil is a fantastic role model,I appreciate the perspectives this podcast has brought me. I feel included in the conversations and learn something new about the world or myself every episode. I really admire Jameela’s ability to bring up personal questions in a safe and encouraging way. She is so eloquent in the way she’s speaks while still being so relatable. Great pod.
5,Love this show and all the guests!,"I’m a huge fan of Jameela’s sense of humor and they way she unapologetically speaks up against injustice and bigotry. I especially love the guests she chooses to host and all of the amazing people I’ve been introduced to through I Weigh, particularly those from the LGBT+ community. Go listen!"
5,Thank you!,Thank you for everything that you bring attention to! I am a 25 year woman working as a bartender and I get sexualized by men constantly. This podcast makes me feel empowered and more capable of standing up for myself. It has inspired me to educate myself further to feel more confident to talk about these issues. I most of the time feel like I'm annoying to people when I do bring these things up. I love that you don't care what people think. I would love to meet you some day just to have a chat about the world and how we can make it better! You are doing something wonderful and its so important! Keep it up!
5,Learn something new each time.,"About one of her guests, about women’s bodies, and so on.  I especially love her guest intros."
4,Women’s voices!,"I have a great deal of respect for Jameela Jamil and her activism, and her guests are great. I wish she would give those guests a little more room to breathe - she often interrupts or steamrolls them in conversation, which disrupts the listening experience. It’s like she’s using her guests to make her point instead of letting them come to that point through the course of the interview. Despite this, it’s a great show and I recommend it to both women and men out there!"
4,Inclusive Podcast!,"I fully enjoy this podcast and I love that it's hosted by a woman of color, features BIPOC folx and other underrepresented communities and really goes in depth on mental health, the toxicity of social media, the problematic patriarchy and other amazing topics. My only feedback is Jameela is so excited and passionate about her guests and topics, that she often cuts them off and does a lot of talking. She uses her opening to talk about where she's at, etc. so I wish for the majority of the interview to be about her guests, their experiences and their voices 🙏🏽"
5,Women empowerment,Love this podcast!!!
5,Refreshing,Thank you for being not only suppportive but hugely informative.  Thank you for all the time and hard work preparing for and giving  great shows.  Please consider (and this is only because I love you all so much) maybe having a podcast mashup with the ladies from POOG who are also smart and fun to listen to.
5,Brilliant,Brilliant conversation. I love the realness of what Jameela and her guests talk about.
5,10/10 Recommend,I love Jameela before but now I love her even more! She is a thoughtful I host who really tries to connect with her guests. The episode with Demi Lovato is my favorite :)
5,The absolute best,I loved Jameela from the Good Place so when I checked out this podcast it made me feel heard and seen and I fell in love. Jameela is someone I idolize so much and hearing about her life and her struggles and having these open conversations with other people I find important and fascinating I just. Thank you Jameela!!! ❤️
5,Dolphin 🐬,"I just found your podcast or it found me. I’m in love with the authenticity, honesty, humor and intelligence between you and your guests.  The color of my 🚙 is Dolphin Gray!!! I paid her off yesterday!!! A great release of “dolphins”. Listen 🎧 to this episode to understand."
5,Love Jameela and guests,"This podcast is so enjoyable, I love the interviews and how she combines so many issues I care about with interesting guests and interviews. I love learning more about people I’ve admired and being introduced to some really fantastic people who are new to me!"
5,like a conversation with a friend,"I love Jameela! She is such a gem. Some of my favorite episodes include her interview with Dr. Deepika Chopra on Optimism and with Dr. Vivek Murthy on Connectivity and the Loneliness Epidemic.

She is so authentic, hilarious, and empathetic, and undoubtedly we need more of these people in what can often feel like a harsh world filled with expectations for what kind of people we “should” be. Thank you Jameela, we all appreciate what you put out there :)"
3,i know she’s trying,"i know jameela jamil is trying to help normalize mental illness, especially eating disorders, but every time i listen to an episode i end up feeling disappointed. i have had binge eating disorder since i was a small child, and it has never been discussed on this show or even mentioned in passing. it perpetuates the idea that the only eating disorders are “thin/healthy/desirable” and ignores the fact that you can have an eating disorder which further alienates you from “normal/straight size” society the longer you have it. also, fatphobic things and ideas come up way too often with her guests and are left unchecked or are even upheld as facts, and i wish she’d talk to more experts or people with real, scientific/psychiatric knowledge. i really wanted to like this, but i have to unsubscribe because this just makes me feel so bad about myself every time i listen to it."
5,So much love,"This show is my therapy on the days I don’t have therapy. I love it so much, thank you for having these conversations 🙏🏼"
5,A place for everyone.,"If you’re a human with any semblance of an open mind, you’ll love and benefit from this pod and the instagram community."
5,Fabulous!,"Just listened to my first episode, with Dr. Gunter. Very informative and engaging."
5,LOVE this podcast,Absolutely love this podcast. So informative and and real. Jameela for president.
5,A joy,I love listening to this podcast- so positive and empowering. Feels like a form of self care each week
5,LOVE this podcast,Incredible guests and super informative!! Absolutely love tuning in.
5,"So incredible. Seriously, listen now.",This is a recent favorite of mine. I listen to this podcast on the regular but perhaps the greatest part of this is the mental health supportive conversations and the interesting guests that she brilliantly interviews. We all deserve this podcast because we all deserve to love ourselves more and then spread that joy to our surroundings.
5,What a gift.,"This podcast is phenomenal. No shock since it’s hosted by a phenomenal woman, Jameela Jamil."
5,Just what 2020 & 2021 needed,"This is one of my favorite self-care shows for re-affirming progressive, compassionate beliefs and finding empowerment."
5,Absolutely inspiring,This podcast continues to challenge me to continue to undergo personal growth! Thank you💕
5,Lou M 2021,Fantastic! Thank you!!
5,Amazing! Theeee Greatest!,"Thank you Jameela and guests. Every episode is so important, transparent, self-conscious, and brilliant. This podcast has what I need when I need it. I am grateful for the work you and your guest are sharing with world. It truly is meaningful. So much love to all. 💜"
5,The optimism doctor- best episode yet,"I so loved this episode and have loved them all. The conversation about making mistakes was so important. Especially as it relates to social justice and being an ally to BIPOC community. It allowed me to think about a mistake I recently made and not get caught up in shame, but to see how I can move forward and do better ( as a white person)."
5,Refreshing,"Ms Jamil talks about hard things on her podcast, and it's helpful to hear that even celebrities are like the rest of us."
5,Full of healthy ideas,Listening to ‘I Weigh’ is good for your health 💚
5,Incredibly inspirational and entertaining,Jameela will elevate and inspire you during her interviews. I found myself wishing I had people like her in my real life! I am truly changed after just one episode. I am so happy I found this podcast and I can’t wait for more.
5,Love,Love love love this podcast. It is so real and educating. Please have Rep. Ayanna Pressley on the podcast! That conversation feels so necessary.
5,AMAZING,"This podcast is absolutely amazing!! This has made me more confident, happier, and has taught me important lessons that i think everyone needs to know. thank you Jameela Jamil, and much love."
5,Simply phenomenal,"Funny, smart and thoughtful."
1,Liar,She’s a pathological liar.
5,Real talk with a real person,I just love this podcast! I have learned something from each episode. I feel like I’m truly part of the conversation. Jameela is such a genuine and down-to-earth. Thank you!
5,Thank you!,Love love love this podcast and the honest conversations!
5,"Love, love, love this!💕",Got hooked on Jameela while watching The Good Life during the early days of COVID lockdown. Was even more intrigued after reading a lil bit about Jameela’s background and all the crap she’s been through. I recently started listening to this podcast and all I can say is  “Wow! Fantastic podcast with great guest and fabulous topics. Carry on...👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
5,Honesty,Love the honesty of the host and guests!! Enjoyable to listen to!
3,Grateful and confused,"*I’m editing this review to say: if you have experience with an eating disorder maybe avoid the episode with Caitlin Moran or proceed with caution. There are many details that can be very triggering and unhelpful, as well, not HAES informed (the O word is used).*

I genuinely think Jameela is doing great work and I’m grateful for her public self reflection and vulnerability. I hope she continues to role model  how to give ourselves permission to learn and unlearn as fast or slowly as we need. I also think she speaks to an AMAZING range of incredible people. With that said, as someone who is deeply concerned about, and recovering from diet culture and deep into learning about dismantling it, I’m disappointed that I get frustrated with the ways she still seems to miss the mark. I think it’s okay to say this because it’s different when talking about someone you know versus someone with a huge platform who talks about this stuff intentionally using that platform. Maybe I’m being too picky but it’s these things that make it hard for me to listen sometimes: examples: when interviewing Aubrey (Yrfatfriend), she interjects to share about how she can relate and talks about her chubbiness in childhood; about how she loved her tummy and would intentionally show off her “food baby” or “stick it out”. The thing is, I wanted to hear about Audrey’s experience not about how their experiences are similar. Because they *are* different and that was Aubrey’s point. Someone who can actually “stick their tummy out” or show a food baby is not the same as the kind of fatness that gets oppressed. Many people cannot choose when they want or don’t want to stick their bellies out and a “food baby” only really shows when your thin enough that eating will make a difference in the shape and size of your belly. This is just an example but instead of always relating it back to her moments of undoubtedly difficult but normal weight gain I wish we could just embrace the fat experience. Next, the ads. Why are they all wellness ads? And I don’t mean the kind of wellness that is counter to “wellness” and diet culture. She says she takes Ritual vitamins because they are *clean* (this is a harmfully ambiguous and notorious “wellness” culture term that falsely demonizes large groups of foods and harmful for those with orthorexia) also she says she takes them because she is lazy and isn’t always a nutritional expert. I know she’s being silly but its actually a “wellness” culture marketing technique (pulled from diet industry) to play on our vulnerability of not being nutritional experts to get us to spend money on expensive vitamins that we’re probably already getting from our food. They target those who can already afford to get their needs met through food but often don’t because elite wellness culture preaches restriction. No one should have to be a nutritional expert to eat and be well and that’s what is wrong with our culture. That’s the whole point against “wellness” culture. Lastly with the vitamins, you can take them on an empty stomach! Incase you don’t eat breakfast I guess? Again this is not meant to pick on Jameela, I am in full support of her but I couldn’t help but notice the bad feeling I get again and again when I hear these things. I know there must be others in recovery who feel the same."
5,Yaaaaaaaaas,"Yes. So needed. Great pod. Amazing. Relevant and helpful and awesome guests. Could you please list the websites and social media tags and links (when approp) of the guests in the show notes! That’d be extra helpful
THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING POD
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
5,Amazing,Amazing amazing amazing! the revelation! The personality! Love love! I’m obsessed
5,Excellent!,This is one of my favorite podcasts and I look forward to it dropping each week.  Jamila has excellent guests and excellent discussions and we all need more of the transparency and humanity that is shared in each episode.
5,Highlight of my Friday!,"I look forward to new episodes every week. The guests are so wonderful, and I feel like this podcast constantly pushes me to love myself and love the world better"
5,Queen,"Just utter positivity and uplifting	 messages from this podcast, and I could listen to Jameela Jamil’s voice forever."
3,I feel cheated,"I love how open and enthusiastic you are and I feel cheated this week. I was very excited to hear from the guest yet my experience was you were asking follow up questions then answering with your own experiences and advice. I felt you did most of the talking. I felt cheated out of expertise from a guest I was excited about.
Again I love your enthusiasm and candor,,please consider listening to this week’s show. What would you do differently?
Thanks again."
3,Let guests speak!,Love Jameela’s opinions but would love to hear that if her guests too. She interrupts and talks over them a lot.
4,Love Jameela and agree with comments about interruptions,I love Jameela and how she is using her iweigh platform to advocate for really important issues. I do agree though that sometimes it’s hard to get through an episode because she often interrupts guests in the middle of their responses. I feel that her comments/experiences are valuable and there can be a more thoughtful way to engage in dialogue that allows space for both participants.
4,Yessss,"Love to hear from outspoken women! Suggestion to include a photo of the guest as the episodes thumbnail, similar to Armchair Expert. Sometimes I recognize someone’s face but not their name, might entice me to listen! :)"
5,Podcast for Badasses,Out spoken femmes.  I am hear for this!
5,Love love love,"Jameela is a fabulous host and I love the guests she chooses and the conversations are always funny, informative and interesting. 💕💎"
5,iWeigh has weight,"Jameela has amazing guests on her show who advocate for important causes and it’s lovely to be introduced to these people. I’m glad she uses her influence to promote others, especially Black women."
5,Love!!!,"I absolutely lOVE your podcast. Being a New Orleans girl, BIG FREEDIA!!!!  And omg Gloria Steinem!!!  Keep up the great work!  And I love how relatable and real you are!  💕✊🏼"
5,Jameela is a gift to the world,Jameela discusses in depth so many niche topics that need attention and she chooses her guests with care. I love the episodes with Alok and Beanie most but each one has its own unique purpose and conversation!
5,Great space to learn,So many great topics tackled by the lovely host and guests.
5,Judy Collins would be a great guest!,"She has dealt with suicide, alcoholism, anorexia and bulemia!
junket33"
5,5 starts,One of my faves.
5,Learning,"I love this learning space; This is the space where we set aside self interest/system-serving to, instead, build healthier more equitable ways of thinking and living. Smash the system!! Thank you!"
5,The podcast I was looking for,"I am in love with this podcast. If you’re looking for a podcast about frank, deep conversations about mental health and all things around that, then this podcast is for you! I also love the humor. Let’s learn together!"
1,Unsub re visit to M/H,"I followed you for a long time.

As I am a hardworking - unprivileged - white woman - abused from coaches when young, raped at 16, attacked by police and bosses in my industry - while being held prisoner and fighting - I find it fascinating that you would champion the two Sussex clowns when she has not lifted a finger but to handle her own ways and means.  

Turn it around.

I’ve been driving deliveries 14 hours a day and trying to help my sons as well as working underground with far more groundbreaking individuals"
5,What an inspirational podcast,I just started listening to this podcast after listening to Jameela on Conan’s podcast. I just finished Debra Messing’s episode. I loved it. I cried at the end. After Jameela asked what she weighs I fully expected her to say a number. I didn’t know what the ending response was going to be. Such an inspiration. Thanks so much for doing this amazing podcast Jameela. You are an amazing lady.
1,doesn’t let guests talk...,"sadly, she talks too much about herself..."
5,Therapeutic empowerment,"This podcast is as addictive as it is real and funny. It’s helped me rethink and revisit parts of myself I thought were healed, and put me on a journey of empowerment and self growth I never knew I needed.

I’ve recommended it to every one of my girlfriends!!"
5,Love Jameela!,"This podcast is funny, informative, and awesome!"
5,The voices we need to hear!,"Love Jameela, love this podcast. ALOK’s episode is by far my favorite - these are the conversations we need to be having. My only teensy observation is that Jameela tends to talk over her guests a lot when they’re clearly trying to speak, and often goes on at length instead of leaving space for the guests to talk and share their own experience."
5,Very interesting,"The guests are always so funny and they just chat so honestly and seem so genuine
the episode with Aisling Bae is probably one of my favorite episodes of a podcast of all time🙌🙌🙌"
5,Truly uplifting,"I love this podcast and I love I Weigh. You make me feel heard and seen and valid. Thanks for being such an advocate to so many diverse and overlapping groups - and thanks for relentlessly speaking up. And finally, thank you for introducing me to so many interesting and diverse guests and points of view. I’m still learning and evolving as a person. Your pod is helping me explore so many other people experiences and voices. It’s so powerful. Thank you."
1,Waste of time,"If you’re gonna treat your opinions like facts, at least don’t be a jerk about it"
1,Can’t support a podcast that promotes outers!,iO TW? REALLY JAMEELA? Someone who falsely publicly outed a child TO GET ATTENTION? So grossed out and disappointed!
1,Supporting Abusers and Liars,Filth.
1,How dare you,Give a platform to a liar! IO Tillett Wright is a toilet mouth! Shame on you!!
5,iLove,"I’ve been meaning to listen for so long, and now, months into the pandemic, I’m finally here! Do not wait as long as I did! Because of all the isolation everyone is feeling right now, I am so grateful to be able to listen to voices like Jameela’s and her inspiring and insightful guests. Each episode has challenged the way I look at at least one thing or another in the best way. (And she has such a great sense of humor!)"
5,Important things being said in this podcast!,"This podcast is so beautiful. Jameela Jamil is an outstanding host and has so much empathy and care for her guests. I’ve learned so much from her and her conversations with these brilliant people! Thank you for this, and thank you for the openness and genuineness."
5,Happy Heart,This podcast makes my heart so happy. Amazing guests and the most genuine conversations.
5,Amazing!,Thank you so much for creating your podcast! Keep up the amazing work! It is truly a pleasure to listen to you
5,Binge Listen,I can’t explain how much I love this podcast! It covers so many important topics with amazing guests!
5,this podcast is truly healing,"Where has this podcast been my entire life? I am enjoying these conversations so thoroughly and feeling all sorts of empowered after listening. Thank you, thank you, thank you to Jameela and guests."
5,IWEIGH podcast,"I LOVE THIS PODCAST. so educating, vulnerable, and overall a loving environment. would definitely recommend to anyone and EVERYONE!"
5,Breaking the walls of the once Taboo conversation on mental health,"I’m currently on my mental health journey and it’s so refreshing to hear the vulnerability of Jameel and how she creates an open dialogue with her guests to also be vulnerable and share their truth. Listening to these episodes I feel all the feels; happy, empathetic, validated, educated, relieved, impressed, and proud. This podcast is helping to break the walls of the once taboo conversation of mental health! Thank you!!"
5,Wonderful,Jameela is a wonderfully refreshing voice the the white male dominated world of podcasts. I love her honest conversations with guests and focus on mental health as a huge priority in ones life.
5,Fantastic human representation,"Such a wonderfully inclusive and acceptance embracing show, Jameela is delightful in every way! ❤️

Also, I would love to see Ruby Gettinger on the show! She has one of the most radiant personalities and would be a great guest in my opinion! 

Keep helping,
Loyal Weighter"
4,"Loving the content and guests, but stop interrupting, Jameela!","Love the topics and the guests of the podcast, but noticed Jameela does interrupt guests frequently. POC are interrupted more often than white folks, and I wish Jameela would let them complete their thoughts before interjecting with her own."
2,Stop interrupting and centering yourself,"I really wish someone else would host this podcast. jameela always seems to interrupt her guests and ask questions that presume her interviewees experience (eg you must have felt some type of way being X identity your whole life). she also interjects and projects her own trauma onto her guest’s narrative, it’s very cringe worthy. she positions herself as an ally but it all seems performative since she doesn’t uplift the voices she claims to make space for."
3,I love the guests AND...,"I wish that Jameela Jamil would take up less space when she interviews women. I started the Munroe Bergdorf episode so excited to listen to a trans woman of color who is from a different country and thereby experiencing something I’m unfamiliar with so I can learn more about how to show up for our trans family better in all facets of legislation, and I just listened to Jameela talk over her at every turn. It’s disappointing to watch someone who says they are there to amplify voices when they drown those voices out with their own."
3,Give the guests a bit more space,"I love Jameela and the guests she’s chosen to highlight. I wish she’d give them a bit more space to speak and tell their stories. She’s a very empathetic listener, which unfortunately seems to prompt her to chime in a tad over much with her own takes, experiences, opinions, etc. Still a good listen, with interesting people whom I’m never hearing from elsewhere."
5,Fantastic,I love that she talks about bodies in a real way!!!!
5,Brilliant Brave and Hilarous,Thank you Jamila and your incredibly wise and truth speaking guests for this podcast. As a white gal in recovery this is part of my support plan. Love it!
5,I can’t believe Nicole said that 🤣🤣🤣,Nicole is funny
1,Irony,The irony should not be lost on her listeners that while she champions lgbtq+ and has called herself queer before-she posted a video praising Louis Farrakhan who’s known 1st for being anti Semitic and 2nd for being homophobic.
5,An inspiration,"Jameela is brilliant, humble, hilarious, and inspiring. The world is a better place with her and this podcast in it."
5,This has quickly become my favorite podcast,I love Jameela and her vulnerability/honesty. She does a great job of bringing that out of her guests as well. I always feel uplifted and better shout myself after listening.
5,So Inspiring,iWeigh is such an empowering listen and perfect to stimulate me during the boring work days and helps me be a more informed feminist!
5,LOVE THIS PODCAST,"Great talks, great interviews, great celeberties."
5,Love you,Love Jameela
5,It’s like free therapy,"She is so genuine and authentic; easy to relate but each episode inspires me to try harder, reach deeper or to feel confident to look in the mirror and say “I’m amazing!”"
4,Amazing,"Just real, deep, powerful conversations filled with love and respect. 
Thank you for this exploration of life. It’s beautiful."
5,Empower Hour,Such tasteful navigation of really tricky topics. I have found such love and support in this podcast in knowing this is a community of other people feeling the *feeling of* insurmountable weight of being human. Can’t wait for more!
5,Best Podcast Ever,"She knows how to help the others, she is awesome, brilliant and empowering to everyone, not only women but all genders. You’re the best Jameela."
5,Deeply Honest,This podcast manages to cover some very intense subjects with a perfect balance of levity and respect. It’s a hearty dose of empathy for listeners who have faced similar challenges in life. Hearing folks talk openly and honestly about their damage makes me feel less alone with mine.
5,Best podcast this decade!,"Hands down the most pleasant, important, and informative podcast I've ever listened to!"
5,Thank you ❤️,"This is my new favorite podcast, that I actually listen to every episode of. I really appreciate the authenticity and the whole underlying intent, and I’ve really enjoyed the choices of guests so far. I’d really love to see a crossover at some point between this one and my other favorite, The Mental Illness Happy Hour—it would be really awesome to hear you and Paul interact ❤️ Anyway, thank you so much for doing this show, for being brave enough to put yourself out there and be an example of vulnerability and honesty."
2,Cringeworthy,"I really enjoy this podcast for the most part but good god, more often than not it feels like Jameela is trying to one up whoever she is interviewing. “I’d love to hear you talk about your trauma but first let me tell you about MY trauma and how and why it’s much more interested than yours!” The topics discussed (or attempted to be discussed) on this podcast are important, however I feel genuinely bad for Jameela’s guests. I am listening to this show to hear about THEM and THEIR experiences, not hers."
5,Thank you,Thank you Jameela Jamil for being my favorite superhero and empowering us all. I could not love you more and I hope you NEVER stop clapping back!
5,Breath of fresh air,Incredible. New favorite podcast for sure. I love how real and honest this is. The conversations are so important.
5,Revolutionary,"I love the way Jameela Jamil talks about such controversial subjects as weight, mental health, feminism, and other issues that have arisen in our lives due to the many faults in our social systems. She’s so open to exploring new ideas—even if it means getting things wrong and having to apologize and learn from it—and it’s easy to see that she comes from a place of love. The variety of guests and wide range of discussion topics round out the show, and Jameela’s easygoing conversation style makes it feel like a safe and welcoming place. I look forward to listening to future episodes and learning along with Jameela. This podcast has already become a part of my weekly routine, and it will hopefully be a big part of expanding my own understanding of myself and the world."
5,everything I wanted it to be,Incredible. Honest. Open. Uplifting. Real. AMAZING!
5,"Touching, funny, real","Jameela is able to bring in guests we know or find out we want to know, and get them to open up about subjects that are usually taboo. Weight issues, food issues, mental health, periods... she gets stars to talk about things that, yes, everyone experiences. She also tries to get to the root causes of these issues (mostly it's the patriarchy). 

Jameela is a good interviewer in that she is very open, which makes her guests feel able to share their experiences. However, sometimes she talks over the guests. She has already gotten better at letting her guests finish their thoughts in the first few episodes, and I know she will continue to improve. Jameela knows she is a work in progress, in this podcast and everything else, which is what makes her such an inspiration!"
4,Let your guest talk!,"I love Jameela, but she tends to talk over her guests A LOT! Please stop talking for them. It’s super cringe and I want to love this podcast so much. Just ask the questions you want of your guest and please let them completely finish their response before interjecting with your answer or your take on their answer. Thanks!!"
5,Get HIP to Jameela Jamil,"If you are not hip to Jameela Jamil yet... THEN YOU MUST STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING. Follow her on IG, try to follow her on Twitter and most importantly listen to this podcast. Her message is of STRENGTH, EMPOWERMENT and it speaks to everyone who is against everything hate fueled. My advice is open your ears, heart and mind to this podcast!!!!!"
5,Love it!,Thank you!
4,Needed to Hear,"A lot of these are important and perspective changing interviews and I’m glad I finally clicked play on the episodes. Demi’s interview in particular and her talk about legalizing food and her rallying cry for forgiveness culture really resonated with me. You can’t be everything that everyone wants you to be; you can only try to be your best self, as you define it, and be kind to yourself and others. This podcast really brings a necessary voice to that message.

To the people criticizing Jamil’s interview skills- she’s been doing this most of her 10+ year career. Just because you only heard of her recently doesn’t mean she’s new or untested. She’s bringing her authentic self to these conversations and, whether it suits you or not, she’s communicating compassion and understanding when she shares her stories with her guests. I, for one, appreciate hearing the different aspects of difficult issues and getting insight into how people cope and often struggle with these difficult experiences. I don’t want her to stop sharing her stories, because it helps define the same-but-different aspect of mental illness, eating disorders, body image, and other important issues. It’s a complete value add as far as I’m concerned."
5,So positive and important,I love Jameela and Aisling together so much. This was such an important conversation. And funny!
5,absolutely incredible,"i discovered jamilla jamil through watching the good place, but now adore her iweigh movement.  she’s one of the most inspiration humans i have ever seen and i love her and her guests raw honesty on this podcast.  hope to see more episodes and love all you stand for!"
5,Empowering,"Every other day, I go on a walk (social distancing) while listening to this podcast. The way Jameela is able to explore these sensitive issues with others is empowering. She doesn’t have all of the answers and doesn’t pretend to. She simply wants to learn with us and help us be more aware of our surroundings. As a teenage girl growing up in an increasingly digital world, I’m so grateful that these conversations about body issues, loneliness, and eating disorders are being had.

The world is a scary place but i_weigh helps me conquer it. 

Thank you Jameela"
5,Favorite podcast,"Jameela Jamil has quite a unique personality, and I love hearing her life story and the stories and opinions of her guests. This podcast is real, and the message is so powerful. It is absolutely my favorite podcast!"
2,Too hard to listen to,"I’d never heard of this interviewer before but the Reese Witherspoon episode was so good that I thought I’d follow her. 
This latest episode with Aisling Bea was terrible. I had to stop ten minutes in. The constant interruptions and talking over one another made it unbearable to listen to. Learn some interviewing techniques and stop and let your guest speak."
5,Love it!,"I just found out about this podcast, Jameela is fantastic, I’m obsessed with her!"
5,Inspiring and a role model,I love jameela and she’s truly inspiring so when I heard she was coming out with a podcast I was so excited and the moment it came out I listened to the first episode and it has been my favorite podcast since❤️
5,So funny and interesting,Super fun to listen to - I love Jameela’s humor is so funny and she manages to approach big topics in a truthful but light fashion.
5,Unapologetic self acceptance,"I truly enjoy Jameela's theme of unapologetic self acceptance in this podcast.  She is candid, funny, and genuine.  Her guests are thoughtfully selected and have meaningful perspectives and voices for women.  I particularly enjoyed Reese Witherspoon's episode.  She is a trailblazer.  I'd love to see Kesha or Megan Markle as guests in the future."
5,"Great conversations, less interruptions would be nice","I love Jameela’s candidness and humor in addressing these very important issues and really connecting with the guests in open conversation. However, I did notice the interrupting as some other reviews mentioned and it is kind of annoying as I would like to hear the guests full response. I don’t mind having a millisecond of silence between answers, just let them finish speaking."
4,Interrupting,"Very important podcast for women to hear. If I could give one tip, it would be to please stop interrupting other women to tell your own stories while you’re interviewing them."
4,"Less interruptions if possible, please!","Love Jameela’s insight, but she frequently interrupts her guests as they’re in the middle of an answer. The show picked good guests, would like to hear their full answers!"
5,Truly brilliant,10/10 don't event hesitate to subscribe. A must listen for any human who has ever felt self conscious about how they look to the world
5,Love!,Just listened to the episode with Demi Lovato and appreciate the openness and vulnerability of the conversation. It makes it feel very raw and unfiltered. Thank you Jameela for creating this much needed podcast and movement! I am looking forward to seeing the growth of the show. I also think Jameela has improved on letting her guests speak more and is on the path to becoming a fantastic interviewer!
2,An undertone of weight stigma,"I have been impressed with Jameela’s work in the past and was excited for this podcast personally, and as a resource to offer the teens I work with.  The interview with Beanie left me uncomfortable, as I felt Jameela was trying to differentiate herself from Beanie and assert that she was smaller.  By insisting that she only wears a large or saying “things there don’t even fit me”, it felt patronizing.  I really enjoyed Beanies sentimate of saying her weight was the least interesting thing about her and I felt like Jameela just kept pushing to talk about size. But, perhaps that’s the point of the podcast. Worthwhile listen for those using critical thinking but could feel belittling to people in recovery or struggling with body image."
5,Love the message behind this show!,"I’m SO happy that Jameela started this podcast! I wish there were more episodes so I could binge listen to it- the guests share such relatable stories about their past struggles and it reminds me that I’m not alone in what I’m going through. This show reminds us that being human is not being perfect, it’s about so much more."
5,Excellent and fun,I love the work jameela does and hearing her have frank conversations with such interesting and passionate people is a delight!
5,Dear Jameela,"Jameel Jamil, first of all, thank you for creating this podcast. I’ve been somewhat silently suffering with an eating disorder for a few years now, and although I’ve received a bit of clinical help, I’ve ended up learning more about how to feel better and accept my body just by listening to this podcast. You and your guests are such a breath of fresh air for me. You hold so many of the same values as I, and there’s nobody who I’m currently surrounded by in my quarantine that thinks the same way about beauty standards or body image or ideas of femininity. So this podcast has truly done a lot for my mental health in the past couple days. Thank you for being so unfiltered in the best possible way. I wonder if you’d be willing to take questions from your listeners to ask your guests?"
3,"Love concept, execution needs work","I love the concept of this podcast and I adore Jameela. I think the podcast will go from good to great once Jameela refines her interviewing skills. She tends to cut guests off and starts talking about herself. It’s typical of people who have poor listening skills because they are too caught up thinking about how to respond. Being an engaged listener while keeping an interview on track, no doubt, takes practice. It’s is a skill that has to be refined, and I look forward to listening to the podcast as it continues to evolve."
5,Love it!,"It’s great! I love that the questions she asks are so different than normal interviews. I feel like I get to know the people on a deeper level. 

Thank you Jameela for your work and activism!"
5,Insightful and fresh,"I have listened to all of the available episodes and really enjoyed and felt refreshed from this content. Jamilla is smart, funny and empathetic. Her guests have interesting and empowering messages and I’ll continue to tune in each week.  Also, the theme music whimsically melancholic, a breath of fresh in my life right now. I walk away hopeful"
5,The best!,I love this podcast. Jameela has such an amazing personality and puts her spin on everything. I love that she opens up about her past and current struggles. I really connect to all the topics and find it super informative. Thank you for making this and using your platform to further your word with mental health and woman/ people empowerment. I have been telling everyone to listen because it has something for everyone.
3,Interviewing is a skill,"I really support Jameela and the impact she’s working to make in the world and I hope to see this podcast get better as her interviewing skills improve. Like some other reviewers, I agree that the show would benefit from the guests being allowed to speak more fully and complete their thoughts, and for Jameela to hold back a bit on her opinions and experiences. While a back and forth can bring out more in the interviewee, the best interviewers put themselves in the background and focus on actively listening to their guests. Wishing this show all the best 💖"
5,So excited!,I love Jameela Jamil and her outspoken unwillingness to sit quietly. I’m so excited to see her expand her I weigh platform to a podcast. I really look forward to hearing more of her.
3,More time for your guests to speak,It would be lovely if guests have more time to speak and finish their thoughts.
5,This made my day!!,"When I heard Jameela on the ‘Life is short with Justin Long’ podcast, I thought to myself how much I wished she had her own podcast. I found this podcast last night by accident and couldn’t be more excited. 

Jameela is hilarious and real.  It’s so rare and exactly what we need right now. Thank you!!"
5,Amazing podcast amazing woman,Jameela is doing Gods work with this podcast.  Love it!
5,Also Enjoyed the Info,I found Jameela’s use of the F bomb extremely necessary and I’m positive that I’ll listen to another interview. I really like Reese Witherspoon and what she has to say.
1,Good but could be great,"I’m a big fan of Jamila’s work and I enjoy listening to her talk on other podcasts, but she doesn’t seem entirely comfortable in the role of interviewer. I wish she would ask a question and then leave space for the other person to talk rather than asking a question, getting a brief answer, then stepping in with lengthy commentary about her own opinion on the subject. The whole point of an interview is to get the interviewee’s take on things, not the interviewer’s. I’ll check back on later episodes because I want to like this podcast and I think it’s a space for important conversation, but it’s a missed opportunity to have an illustrious guest on a show and not let them fully tell their story."
5,A proper buffet for the mind,Thank you for this podcast. Listening to the conversations here is like pulling over on a road trip and stumbling upon the most wonderful buffet of goodness.
5,A true gem,Loving this podcast! Thank you for talking about the things we need to have conversations on. You are fantastic inspiration and example girl. 👏🏽
4,Enjoyed the info,I found Jameele’s use of the F bomb really unnecessary and l doubt I will bother listening to another interview. I really like Reese Witherspoon and what she had to say.
5,Thank you,These podcasts came out at the right time. Thank you for making these.
3,IWeigh,"This is a great concept, and I really enjoyed the first 2 episodes. However, Jameela’s interview style is somewhat grating. She constantly interrupts and talks over her guests, and it was really apparent in the Reese Witherspoon episode. Reese would be talking and Jameela just cuts Reese off and starts talking about herself. Reese is so knowledgeable and has so much more experience that it was frustrating to hear her get run over by Jameela’s (often inappropriate) rambling. I could tell Reese was frustrated by it too; especially when she tried to correct Jameela’s incorrectly stated “statistics” about women in healthcare. I had to turn it off after that.  Will give it another chance though!"
5,Great Find,"Powerful, vulnerable, and honest. Such great conversation that can open peoples hearts and minds. Love it."
5,LOVE,"This podcast is a breath of fresh air at a time when everything feels so chaotic and uncertain. Jameela and each guest discuss topics that enlighten and empower the listener.  I’m so glad to add this incredibly positive, candid podcast to my weekly listens. Thank you for all you do."
5,So much honesty,This podcast has already helped me so very much and makes me feel known. I absolutely love Jameela and how upfront she is about such critical issues that more people need to talk about. Thank you so much for making my life and day better!
5,Thank you,Listening to Jameela’s podcast for the first time with Reese Witherspoon. Two incredibly influential women being vulnerable with each other. I appreciate Jameela’s openness and asking such great questions to her guests. I have felt such great anxiety and waves of depression from the news of how our society has created these toxic cultures and to hear and see women who have made cracks of light in so much darkness has been a godsend. Thank you Jameela for being you. Thank you to the guests and their openness and allowing more light to peek through.
5,Grateful for conversations like these,"One of the most necessary podcasts right now. Jameela doesn’t hold back in asking the questions that no one dares to ask. She makes sure to celebrate everyone for what they’ve accomplished and who they are than focus on superficial aspects. I highly recommend this beautiful, emotional and overall expanding podcast to anyone who wants to open their eyes. Thank you jameela for you light, you’re the goddess we need in the entertainment industry 🙏🏻✨❤️"
5,One of the Best Podcasts I’ve Found,"Jameela is so open and honest. She seems unafraid to approach any subject, regardless of the level of vulnerability that subject might possess. I’ve listened to one and a half episodes and I’m already hooked. I can’t wait to see who else she interviews, where else she goes, thanks Jameela for sharing your world with us"
3,Ok,Would like to see not just racial but political diversity also pls
5,YES,"love everything you do, babe, so keep doing things!"
5,Love!,Felt particularly refreshed after listening to the episode with Beanie. Really loving the content. So honest and rejuvenating. Excited to hear more!
5,Fantastic,I absolutely LOVE this podcast. I can tell that Jameela takes her time to pick the topics that are discussed and they are also very personal to her. Thank you for allowing yourself to be so vulnerable in order to help everyone else. ❤️
5,Loneliness Episode,"I love learning and this was wonderfully informative, especially since I am quite lonely and this time of quarantine has only capitalized on it. Thank you, Jameela!"
5,Empowering and thoughtful,"Every woman, every daughter - everyone should listen as Jameela brings such a refreshing view of how we should look at ourselves and not accept what society wants us to be. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
5,Vitek Murthy,"Love his insight into loneliness. Great speaker.  Jameela sharing her own experiences helps us understand we are not the only ones that have felt this way. 
Love her podcast!!👏👏👏👏"
5,You are wonderful!,Thank you for being so genuine and giving mental health the airtime it deserves.
1,Hate this so much,So dumb. Can’t see how people come to believe these things. DON’T LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST.
5,LOVE,"This podcast came out at the perfect time. As some who is figuring out her own mental state a little later in life  (36 years old), this is a beautiful podcast. Breaking a lot of stigmas and making the topic of mental health easier to speak on and digest. Thank you Jameela ❤️❤️❤️"
5,👏👏👏,What!? Yess!!!!!! Love this ♥️♥️♥️♥️
5,The best!,This podcast is just what we need right now.

5,Amazing first episode!!!,I loved the topics discussed and how thoughtful both the host and the guest were when discussing difficult but important issues. The energy of the episode was very warm and calm—definitely felt like I was listening to two friends talk about serious and funny things. I’m so glad this podcast exists and Im really looking forward to the next episode. Oh and the theme music is calming and lovely.
5,Tv,She’s on a show on tru tv misery index
5,An Icon Interviewing Icons,Jameela Jamil did THAT! The podcast we all needed for these times.
4,💖💖💖,"Loved this first episode with Beanie, she really does radiant joy. I also obviously love Jamila and all that she does. The podcast is truly what we need right now! Sending so much love and success to this podcast. 

My only critique would be cutting the speaker off occasionally and talking over them. I know this is completely unintentional but there were many moments during the episode where it felt like Beanie was cut off in the middle of saying something and I wish she was able to fully speak and share her story with fewer interruptions. Again, it’s minor and I don’t mean to point fingers but I think this is really heightened in podcasts where the listeners are only hearing the dialogue."
5,I love this so much!,Exactly what we need right now❤️
5,So excited for this podcast!!!!!,"Thank you, Jamil, for starting this inspiring and timely movement and podcast about body image, mental health, female power and support, you name it! Can’t tell you how many women will benefit in ways they never thought was possible after hearing what you and you guests have to say. Really looking forward to more :)"
5,Love you Jameela 💜,So excited for this. Love what you do and how you do it ❣️💜
5,Radiant Kindness,There is so much positivity and kindness and love here—a soothing podcast that makes me feel heard and understood. Lovely!
5,All the feel goods,She touches on every aspect and is totally real with herself and the guest. I know it’s the only first episode but I know it will only get it infinity better!!!
5,So positive and uplifting!!,"Excellent interview and so important for young people to hear positive thoughts and advice. Listening to discussions of sexuality and weight acceptance make me wish I had podcasts to listen to like this one when I was growing up. Society has a way of pushing people down, but having outlets to lift us up is so very important. Thanks for a great interview!"
5,Yes yes YES!,Already recommended it to everyone I know! This is amazing and I’m so excited to see where this leads!
5,What we need in the podcast world,"Real, uplifting, thought provoking, encouraging conversation. Listen to get your “girl power” fix"
5,Jameela is my hero,Love!!! 💗
5,Excited,I’m so excited for this podcast! We need this! I need this! Thank you so much Jameela 💜

5,Can’t wait,"I just listened to the teaser clip with Aisling Bea, and I am so ready for this podcast to exist. This is what humanity has been heading toward."
5,YAY 😍,"Subscribe. This is going to be amazing! I mean, from the sneak peak alone— two of the most hilarious, charming and best-accented people on the planet chatting and crying about the real stuff together. I am beyond excited to hear what will come from this!"
