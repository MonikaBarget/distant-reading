If he was going to share that, he needed to have explicit consent from the aforementioned parties, and if he did indeed have that consent he should have shared that with the audience so we weren‚Äôt left reeling and horrified at the blatant disregard for the ethics surrounding his work with his clients. 

He shouldn‚Äôt have shared this information, let alone shared it and made clear exactly who he was speaking about, and because he did, Amanda should not have posted this part of the episode.

Thank you for all your deep dives and time in research to prepare each episode and provide resources for someone that, like me, has limited resources to get test after test to find root causes and get better.

I was on birth control from the age of 14-25. I had no idea that I could have been supporting my body from that young of an age. I feel so thankful to finally be learning how to properly care for myself, and love my body in the process. I am learning that I can actually *eat more* (enough to be filled) and not feel guilty about it bc my body needs this. I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt have a super long attention span.

I also love that Emily and Amanda discuss the importance of minerals while emphasizing the significance of mineral ratios and how various minerals interact with each other.
