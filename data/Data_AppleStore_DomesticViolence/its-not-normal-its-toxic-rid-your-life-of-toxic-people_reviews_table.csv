8947661388,1,Toxic mother,"What an ungrateful daughter. She is the toxic one. Imagine bringing up a daughter who encouraged her children to distance themselves from their own grandmother.
This young woman has a huge chip on her shoulder, hateful, nasty person.
She is not kind, or a giving woman. 
Mothers should be treated with absolute respect. Yes her mother is dead to her. Karma will come back.",2022-08-05 06:56:01-07:00,,Kerry Hodges

I’m so f...ked up now I’ve become a recluse. 
We are addicted to the chemical oxytocin, dopamine, endogenous opioids - cognitive dissonance  - it’s no wonder we are confused

6891381892,1,Dangerous,I have recently been cut off by my sister who says our relationship is toxic. I listen to this to understand why as there is nothing but love and kindness between us prior to her change in perception. She suffers from depression and anxiety and has found 2020 incredibly difficult - it was at the end of 2020 that she cut me off after I asked her if we could meet up (when restrictions were looser). It’s clear to me now that she has been influenced by content such as this on here and on you tube and other social media and has applied what she has learned to almost all of her relationships. She has no friends and has cut off her entire family. Her fiancé will likely leave her. She has one son who is also now completely isolated. I actually realised through this podcast that she is the toxic person leaving nothing but destruction in her wake. Despite the pain she has caused to me and my family I only have love and compassion for her - she is a wounded and impressionable soul who has got lost in the darkness. There are toxic relationships out there some of which we do need to move away from - but there are also normal relationships with flawed people that can be improved if we work at them. You are what you eat - Be careful what you consume.,2021-01-20 00:10:31-07:00,,Revierererer

I’m pretty certain regardless what kind of title you want to put it I’m pretty certain my partner is very narcissistic. Tell that my father is very similar. It seems like it’s a pattern I go through of dating the wrong guys and trying to find that love I so much craved from my father. I never got his approval and so I searched and searched to find love. I’m on my self-love journey but at the same time I’m still stuck in limbo. I’m going back to the same guy who treats me like garbage everyone says just leave and block them but it’s, like losing a piece of yourself when you’ve been with them so long I guess with mine situation I feel like I’ve lost part of myself and someone told me going through a toxic relationship.

Also, you have to wade through her spiel at the beginning, sometimes 10 minutes of it, to get to the topic at hand. Plus the volume of the intro and ending is much higher than her voice and I’m constantly having to adjust my own volume. And she talks very fast, so it’s sometimes hard to follow her. I would feel more comfortable if she added some certification to work with individuals in a mental health capacity.

3544966466,5,Respond to Dec 7 review,"I’m sorry you perceived it as you did. I teach from a level of educating yourself so you do not repeat the abuse cycle. I am not a counselor, I was a victim so I would not speak from the point of view you interpreted!  We all end up there not knowing how we got there so if I was speaking about education it is for further prevention! Thank you so much for listening and for the review.",2018-12-18 06:05:05-07:00,,drbrocke

It concerns me that a counselor specialized in toxic relationships has the view point that if you aren’t aware of toxic traits and you end up in a toxic relationship it’s your own fault.,2018-12-07 14:51:35-07:00,,ydueyehastoo
