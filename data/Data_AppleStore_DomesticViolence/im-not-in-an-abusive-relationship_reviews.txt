Love what you’re trying to do

Just want to say that although I LOVE the work you’re trying to do, some of the information in episode 54 in particular is not correct. Importantly, traffickers all too often DO have intimate relationships with those they are trafficking. I don’t want to bash the girls you brought on the episode because I understand that they’re well meaning and some of the info they presented is spot on, but as the owner of a business that consults on trafficking issues and trains on anti-human trafficking measures, I also understand that IPV and human trafficking are far more interconnected than than this episode suggests. I would have loved to see you discuss more about how victims are recruited and the signs that someone is being trafficked!

Needed this

Thank you for making a podcast that can help people who don’t even realize how toxic things have become. Helps put a lot into perspective especially what’s been normalized in relationships these days. Thank you so much.

You blessed me

I listened to a few of your episodes but the one that got me together was where you were discussing the factors behind shame and guilt when being molested and raped. I have a sexual abuse platform I’m building called Survivor To Overcomer... S2O so when I hear this particular episode, I shared it to help others! Just because your body reacted in its natural form does NOT mean you endorsed what was being taken! I didn’t personally deal with that! But i wanted to share it because I never even thought about that! Men becoming hard or women becoming wet... And I was molested and raped as a child! I say all of this to say PLEASE continue to educate the culture! My motto is “NO FINE LINES!” Please continue to help make we’re creating healing for the overcomes, understanding to those connected and society, and distinct ways to determine what’s what!

A needed resource

Thank you to the organization behind this podcast, Domestic And Sexual Abuse Services of Michigan, for having the foresight to bring stories of hope to those in need. Claudia has such a great way about her. I can tell from the first episode. This is a needed resource in the world!
