Domestic Violence Prevention

We need to make people of more awareness of domestic violence.

I hope you continue with this

As a survivor myself I know that other people stories really helped me find strength as I was getting out of my situation and healing and I hope that you continue on that journey because the only way to stop the violence is to stop the silence
