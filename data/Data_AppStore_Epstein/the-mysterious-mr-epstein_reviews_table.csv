This excellent work makes you consider how rotten the people who swore to protect society were? are? We can but hope the truth will out. Depressingly this tells the tale of a man who thumbed his nose at the Law and got away with it too often, for too long. Lady Justice must have wanted to fall on her own sword. Plaudits to the victims who spoke up, the journalists and law enforcement who at personal risk championed them and stood up and the producers/presenters of podcasts like this who keep the injustice forefront In our minds and aim dig beyond redaction and spin.

10460042852,5,Top-notch research and excellent presentation! Definitely listen!!,"I am VERY picky about podcasts and I positively DEVOURED this one in one day! It‚Äôs a fascinating and unflinching- not to mention horrifying!- post-mortem of Epstein‚Äôs life, crimes, and ultimate death. Each episode fearlessly strips away the mountains of excuses and ‚Äúbuck-passing‚Äù of those who should and could have stopped the monster and lays bare the legal/judicial failings and free passes, financial shell games, extortion, and intricate web of political and personal grooming, manipulation, pay-offs, pattern of trading favors with those in power, and careful coercive control employed by Epstein to amass his fortune and gain his ‚ÄúUntouchable‚Äù status. The importance of this examination cannot be overstated! While the subject matter is often difficult to listen to, he is always respectful of the survivors of Epstein‚Äôs reprehensible crimes and we need to know how this happened in order to ensure that it never happens again, and it‚Äôs plain that THAT is the mission of this podcast. 
The narration is engaging, -he doesn‚Äôt go off on too many tangents but he does interject at some points with appropriate comments that you‚Äôre almost certainly thinking yourself (for example, if there‚Äôs a quote from someone who‚Äôs lying through their teeth, he‚Äôll say something like, ‚ÄúCOME ON! We ALL know that‚Äôs a lie!‚Äù)- fast-paced, always clear, and easy to follow. With the energy of a drama, you will almost definitely be yelling at whichever device you‚Äôre using to listen to this podcast at pretty much every twist and turn!!

and can identify with this story on so many points. I was Molly after the first time when I was 42 and had been married for 24 years. I was so at loose ends and wanted a connection of some kind and needed crazy sex all the time. I did things I would never had dreamed I could do and have never regretted my choices. After my second husband of 22 years  died, I was much more sane and had had such a fulfilling marriage with him, I feel no one else could ever have my heart again. He will have it forever. After having had eight years of being wild and crazy, I had married the soulmate I had always dreamed of since my youth. Even though he has been gone for six years, he is with me every day  and I look for his guidance in everything I do. Congrats on doing a podcast that shows the humorous side of cancer, because you need plenty of humor to endure what the different stages bring.  You also captured the rawness of this gut-wrenching disease that makes you feel inside out at so many times during the journey. Everyone wishes to have you as a best friend.

Overall this podcast has struck the right tone on a consistent basis, and the only reason I can fathom that this episode is presented at all is to show the culture of NYC society and the media culture that permitted the perpetrator to operate unimpeded for years.

There is way more time spent with the businessmen Epstein was running with and his closest associates. No one was kept from scrutiny.

4870637253,2,One slight but expected flaw,"It‚Äôs not surprising that one president‚Äôs name was inserted and his voice played as often as possible to associate him with this case while former President Clinton, who molested an intern and who was ENTERTAINED by Epstein,  was mentioned maybe twice so far (-3 stars). The media is quite predictable these days. Anyway, other than that it‚Äôs a 5 star podcast.",2019-10-01 14:12:33-07:00,,Fluffygooey
