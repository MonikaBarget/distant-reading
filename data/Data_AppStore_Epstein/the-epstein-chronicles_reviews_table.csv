8464703078,5,Interview with Maria Farmer - ESSENTIAL listening,"I love this podcast because it provides a synopsis of SOME of the news…….Bobby however digs deeper and gives a broader view on what should be dominating headlines everyday. There is so much more to this story and in the episode with Maria she details from a first hand account just how Epstein, Maxwell & everyone else are connected. I found it to be deeply disturbing and cannot comprehend how the others appear to not be spotlighted. I do hope that there are more interviews.",2022-03-17 03:36:47-07:00,,David Rhys

8184695777,2,dangerously obsessed and filled with hatred,"I listened to a couple of these shows and was struck by his sheer hatred for ghislane maxwell and the rest of these characters in this grisly tale which unfortunately overshadowed the actual genuine facts , we all want to see justice served on these people but this podcaster seems to have a personal vendetta  against them and personally I’d be worried about his mental health with this dangerous obsession.

8108348061,1,More facts less opinion please,I wish the host would provide and concentrate more on the facts and less of his own opinions. He’s supposed to be reporting on a court case after all,2021-12-08 07:02:54-07:00,,-lebowski-

I’ve learned so much from your podcast — more than I wanted to know about human trafficking, money laundering and financial crimes. But it’s all there, and now that you’re reading court documents, we hear in unfortunate detail what that sexual predator did to ruin many young lives. Should have been a RICO case.

I guess if you like rage tweets and dehumanizing absolutely everyone who has anything to do with them u will enjoy. It always makes me laugh when someone in the media denigrates the media, so I did get that laugh. All he does is rage read other people’s work and then insult both them and the subjects.

8937569170,5,Great content,"Been following Bobby since 2019. I , as well as many others I’m sure, went down the rabbit hole with all the odd and weird conspiracies when it comes to the Epstein connections. I really do
Enjoy that he doesn’t touch on stuff he doesn’t have facts on or news that just seems just too far out there. I enjoy that he reads articles and news spur of the moment and gives his side comments as well. So many deep dives with people that are connected to shed light on the rest of the snakes that are still out free roaming around. I try to donate to his go fund me page as well since he does so much research and basically does the homework for me lol. I feel like out of all my friends, I make sure to share updates and new news when it comes to exposing all the co conspirators  within the ring. Much respect, Bobby!

8913774522,5,Quickly becoming a favorite,"Most podcasts covering non-mainstream topics tend to have some level of bias built in to the analysis they provide. The Epstein Chronicles covers a variety of important topics without any of the framing that typically clouds discussions of this type. Episodes are published frequently and even the republished Look Back episodes provide value. Thanks for the hard work, Bobby.",2022-07-26 07:23:23-07:00,,TheOctoberSurprise

8105661641,2,Too Much Opinion,Too much talking & personal opinion.  Just give me the facts & cut out the nonsense. It’s hard to stay focused because of nonsensical addition of words.

8103341325,5,Best Epstein/Maxwell podcast out there,"Bobby has me hooked. Yes he goes on his mini rants or tangents sometime as other reviewers mentioned, but he is rooted in FACT and knows how to separate his opinion from FACT. He will sideline his opinion, which is basically — take it or leave it. Do with it what you will.

Bobby’s earnest about this topic and his passion shines through as I binge his episodes endlessly. Thank you for talking about these missing girls and these disgusting crimes. Thank you for doing investigations and sharing your knowledge.

Give it a listen if you want to go beyond the surface level with the Maxwell trial…",2021-12-06 19:55:13-07:00,,GottahLuvDhisKhidd

8095656182,5,Credible Sourced Pod,"What I love about this podcast is that the journalism has been done and is on record in a way that is accessible, and Bobby is there to read it and give information on the people in the articles and also show the way they or their corporations or their peers are connected to this atrocity. I first heard of Jeffrey Epstein in 2017 and will never forget my husband telling me at dinner that it was a conspiracy that people would think I was nuts and I said it’s on TV and he said what is and I pointed at the tv and there was Epstein. Getting arrested. And when I found this podcast in September of 2019 I have listened faithfully and sent episode out to share and also the articles read have been shared. Nooooowwwww people in my circle who I literally quit talking to because they made fun of me and had dinners to laugh behind my back and text my family members to see how they even believed me are all seeing that it was true. And if media and politicians hit this then what else is being hidden? Sex traffic and human traffic is a scary thing to know our government has been complicit in. I am so thankful for a podcast that has been transparent and given such detailed information. Don’t stop Bobby ! And your partner is a trooper with all she’s gone through as well.
