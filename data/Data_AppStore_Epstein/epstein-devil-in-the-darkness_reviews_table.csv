2019-09-15 06:20:32,This sounds great and is very entertaining. They have some good interviews in episode one. I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight but I‚Äôm going to have to do some soul searching about whether I should listen to any more of this. Dylan Howard aka mate of Harvey Weinstein is the EP.

Many of those interviewed live in the same bubble as Epstein, equally insecure, and unable to be outside this world of the soulless, and emotionally vapid. Epstein just got ‚Äúcaught‚Äù.

2021-05-27 21:52:57,"The stories and life of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs escapades is so disturbing. And I feel terrible for all his victims. But something seems odd to me with this podcast.  I know there were countless girls abused and raped, but when these actors read the diary journals there is no way on earth that 16 girls talk or write like that. The wording, expressions and thoughts quoted just don‚Äôt sound like a 16 years old.

Also, the fact that you can be charged for soliciting prostitution of an underaged person is insane!  By virtue of the fact they‚Äôre underage they can‚Äôt give consent. Therefore it‚Äôs not prostitution it‚Äôs trafficking, rape, sexual assault, etc.",5,Pepper529,Careful with words

You get to hear the story unfold from the horses‚Äô mouths, so to speak, with good editing. To the reviewers who complain there is not enough Clinton names in that expos√©: are you serious? Clinton is mentioned many times, since he was on the Epstein guest list many times. Many other prominent people were too, and their names come up too.

However, in my honest opinion I think this could have been done with a couple less episodes. There were several times when I looked to re-check I wasn‚Äôt replaying an older episode because some of the interview recordings are used multiple times for different episodes. I see where it might have been for emphasis but it seemed like they were running out of details to support the episodes.

Somehow, but very much to be expected, the host & a whole swath of guests manage to turn this into an indictment of Donald Trump & Bill Barr. And it heavily features Lisa Bloom who was a big defender of Harvey Weinstein which is only mentioned in passing. And no mention that her mother is Gloria Allred who‚Äôs a fame chasing media celebrity herself. 

The story is nothing you don‚Äôt already know. And this serves up all the conspiracy theories you can digest. Production is ok but nothing special. The host is quite annoying in her presentation which detracts from everything else.

2020-01-17 16:21:53,"There is some interesting information in this podcast but I found all of the repeated sound bites annoying. I guess they needed to fill up the time and didn‚Äôt have enough new information, so they just kept pasting in the same lines from the same people episode after episode. Also, is Alan Dershowitz a personal friend of someone involved in this project? Why else would we hear repeatedly from this guy who has made a career out of defending misogynists? So, we know Epstein was guilty and that Prince Andrew is very likely guilty of having enjoyed the services of Epstein‚Äôs underage sex slaves, but we are to believe that Dershowitz, who has been directly accused of enjoying Epstein‚Äôs services by Virginia Roberts Giuffre is innocent? All he did was attempt to broker sweetheart deals for Epstein when he was arrested for sex trafficking the first time. Seriously! The fact that you give Dershowitz so much air time in the podcast is offensive. And now he is on the Trump (also accused of raping an underage girl at an Epstein party) impeachment defense team.

2019-09-28 15:43:07,"It‚Äôs a terrific story. And I‚Äôll keep listening. But because information is presented non-chronologically - and sometimes with no date at all - and because information on the same topic is presented in different episodes, the podcast is confused, confusing, and, occasionally, apparently self contradictory. As a result, the podcast raises more questions than it answers. Michael Dugan‚Äôs story, in the bonus episode, is an example. 

Dugan says that he obtained copies of Epstein‚Äôs blackmail videos from the lead investigator in the Palm Beach case; that the investigator died mysteriously shortly after Epstein‚Äôs arrest; that the FBI, claiming to have a sealed indictment, searched Dugans house - and, inexplicably, without arresting Dugan despite the claimed indictment - seized the videos (presumably Dugan copied them and concealed copies); that the tapes and their decryption codes are now with persons in 5 countries; but none of them have both the codes and tapes; and that Dugan has set up a plan for videos to be disclosed should anything happen to him. Dugan ? In the Russian Federation under a grant of asylum, fearing for his safety and his family‚Äôs. 

Dugan‚Äôs story - for which Dugan offers little evidence or analysis - reads like a Tom Clancy novel. But not a word of it, to my knowledge, has been reported in the U. S. media.",4,JoJo 8ball,Interesting But Hard To Follow
