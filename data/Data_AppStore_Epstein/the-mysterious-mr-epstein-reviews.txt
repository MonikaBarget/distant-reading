Wish the rest was available for free

I don't mind lots of ads so the podcast can create income, I understand that people took lots of time to work on this. Please consider letting the rest be free with a bunch of ads in it for income

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subscription??!!

Why can‚Äôt I listen to this for free anymore??!! 
VERY disappointing!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way too many ads

Absolutely ruined an ok podcast with the ads don‚Äôt waste your time!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want more than the first 2 episodes you have go to their website and pay $

After getting the first 2 episodes I am hooked, but the rest of the episodes are unavailable without paying.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wonderful

Another Wondery masterpiece. Amazing story telling and detail. Highly recommended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant Series

I am riveted!! Hanging on every word. Thank goodness he took his own life. Coward. At least he saved the American people the cost of keeping him incarcerated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Get the facts not the hype

Epstein maybe dead but Wondery does a superb job of bringing you all the facts without the overblown hype.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent yet Disturbing

A terrific journalistic piece crossing 6 episodes, but still disturbing in its travesty of justice, ability for the rich and famous to escape justice and their cowardice in facing up to their crimes and bad behaviours

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lost credibility

This podcast lost credibility when they said Jeffrey Epstein had a temple on his island that ‚Äúappears to have a door that locks from the outside‚Äù. This appalled me so I checked the drone footage, and the ‚Äúdoor‚Äù is a painted tromp le‚Äôoil. Its actual door is a glass sliding door - very normal. A great example of how to be technically telling the truth but actually misleading. Now I have to wonder how many other things that I think I know from this podcast, are not true. Surely this guy is horrifying enough that you don‚Äôt need to exaggerate anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a joke

Wayyy too many adds for the length of episodes. Other podcasts available on Jeffery without all the interruptions !!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addicted

After listening to this I am more certain than ever that he didn‚Äôt kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another great Wondery podcast

Loved this one - really engaging and well reported. I actually liked having the ads all in the middle too as I could skip or listen to them all at once, rather than having a shorter ad interrupt the flow every 5-10 mins like other podcasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essential listening

So much of this has been covered up. This is a riveting podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TigerPowerrrrrrrr

What a rege ripper !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads ads ads so annoying

3.5 mins of ads within thirty min episode. Ridiculous. You can‚Äôt just set and forget it.
Most annoying because the narrator does the ads too so you can‚Äôt easily skip them over as you have to listen to see if he is selling a stupid product or informing us of the story.

The content is good though. Very well researchedz

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way too many ads

The ads-to-content ratio for this series is way off. Really disrupts the flow and makes it feel like a 60-minutes piece.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was just OK

It was an easy listen but honestly such surface level information. This is such a complex story that goes on for decades and I don‚Äôt feel this Podcast dived deep enough into the hollows of this complex story. Although interesting- not detailed enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant!

Well done. Compelling listening. Please investigate his co -conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. She needs to be held accountable for what she has done as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loved it

Well researched and informative. I‚Äôm sad that it‚Äôs over.
Everybody needs to chill about the ads. If they don‚Äôt have sponsors we don‚Äôt get the podcast. Get over it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding

A compelling look into the life life and crimes of this predator who managed to operate in broad daylight for decades.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing.

Incredible choice of sponsor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mysterious mr Epstein

I just can‚Äôt get enough of knowing about Geoffrey Epstein. Great podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great journalism

Brilliant and terrifying

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More to the story then I first thought

Good investigative journalism.  Fascinating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent

I love an intelligent and informative podcast that is also cool and unique. Very rare, well done üëçüèª

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good but too many promo‚Äôs.

What a creep!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good content. Excessive advertising content

I really appreciate this series shedding light on atrocious crimes and giving power back to the victims. 

The ads are excessive, repetitive and intrusive to the narrative. Really make it a hard listen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Voiceover on headphones problematic

The podcast switches between both ears of the headphones for a conversation (surround sound style) which whilst dramatic is irritating and a bit surprising. A few times it has made me jump.

Great podcast but this feature is not good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good content but WAY too many adverts

Good content but WAY too many adverts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOAT Creep

As always this is a well researched and delivered podcast from Wondery. You‚Äôll find yourself either simply with jaw open or yelling at your phone over the magnitude of this mans profound creepiness and the willingness of the rich & powerful to embrace him whilst sweeping his crimes under the carpet. Shame on all of you . Thanks again Wondery .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must Add

Great, informative podcast. A must add to your library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best of the current Epstein Podcasts

Great production and narration and obviously well researched so far (ep3). This is one of those podcasts I look forward to each ep.
Two criticisms: way too many ads, which are quite long, interrupting the flow of the story. It‚Äôs a big turn off as I had to keep rewinding back to remember where we we at. The length of time between publishing each episode is long üòä

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant!

Love the narration- Wondery never ceases to excel !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº

Brilliant!!! A must listen üëçüèº

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
????

How did this happen? I don‚Äôt understand how so many people knew what was going on yet nobody did anything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another evil genius brought down by his penis

Countless evil rich  psychopaths have fallen from their towers because they can‚Äôt keep their sexual desires in check. An evil genius with a low libido- now that‚Äôs an unstoppable force. Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode. First class podcasting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intriguing

Very interesting. Looking forward to the next episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ad complaining is a joke!

This is obviously a well made podcast which means 100‚Äôs of hours for a 30-40min episode. To think that a couple of 15 second ads make it difficult for some people to listen. Go put your phone on record and talk for 30 minutes and listen to it then you‚Äôll really see how boring you really are! 
To all the other people that appreciate true journalism this podcast is epic!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great ... but can‚Äôt

I‚Äôd give it a five if it didn‚Äôt have so many ads... hell if I‚Äôd known it was as good as it is I probably would‚Äôve paid for it ...
Ads make this impossible to enjoy ...
Same VO for the Ads as the story ... not a good idea.
Pity... excellent reader , good production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many adverts

So hard to follow podcast due to advertisements interrupting plot .
Very disappointing as it‚Äôs not in the true format of podcasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads

So many ads it‚Äôs actually difficult to listen to. Wish I could keep going, but it‚Äôs too much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way too many adverts

There are way too many adverts interrupting the flow of the podcast
Very distracting
Hard to concentrate on the story with the constant adverts 
Pity - could be a great show

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why do you need a subscription

Was great until you can‚Äôt listen without a subscription

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Boo

Where are all the episodes?
Lame

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great content but Wondery is too expensive

Since Amazon bought Wondery, why is it not included in membership?  Amazon is way too greedy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What a great listen!

Well done and informative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disconnected

Story is disconnected by too many commercials. I had to really try to continue with this podcast. Second episode, I might not listen past this one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Good

This was an excellent podcast for a three hour drive. Went so fast!! Loved it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good

Yes....but I could have done without the detailed penis description.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many mid roll ads

Great podcast. Good listen. The only reason did not get 5 stars is there are too many ads in the middle for other podcasts and it interrupts the flow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wonders

Honestly, wonderY has nailed it. So far I have listened to plame, Enron, Arron Hernandez, and now balco. (Sorry about the spelling). You make my daily workouts at the gym so enjoyable because my focus is on the story, not the physical exhaustionof my workout.  PLEASE DONT STOP - I owe my physical wellness and health you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing!

I didn‚Äôt know much about this man or the story until I happened upon this podcast. Now I can‚Äôt get enough!  I learned so much that I didn‚Äôt know. What a fascinating and heartbreaking story for all involved. I mean come on!  A Prince!  At least one US President. So much more to uncover!  Please bring us more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.

Great listen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing a lot

There is so much more that was unsaid, it's unfortunate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unavoidable

Great journalism work.
Great social and emotional considerations.
Great political message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Introduction

A good introductory podcast to Jeffrey Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very interesting

Well researched podcast that shared a captivating story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself!

Interesting podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mysterious Epstein

Captivating, research excellence, amazing host....highly recommend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus episode

Oh, dear. Vanessa‚Äôs voice is so difficult to listen to. She certainly knows this subject, but I had to turn off this episode because the vocal fry over rode the content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent podcast

5 stars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting content yet over sensationalized

It‚Äôs a story that very much needs to be told and there is some good investigative work. Unfortunately, the podcast feels over sensationalized, complete with contrived cliffhangers, ill-timed ads, and a cheesy theme song. This feels a tad inappropriate given the subject matter is about a convicted child sex trafficker

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Great narrator... Love the theme song. You guys did a terrific job telling such an important story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Astounding, outrageous and completely horrifying

The story of this monster is astounding and so much more complex than I knew. I cant believe this is happening in present day and I‚Äôm very happy that people are finally blowing the lid off this horrible underworld. Hopefully this is step one to eradication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoyable but annoying.

There are a lot of ads and build-ups in the intro, that there really isn't much content in the middle. Also, the ads come in the middle of the episode and it kind of ruins the mood. I was enjoying this, but it definitely jumped in time a lot. It could've been written better. Each episode had a really intense conclusion, which always had me excited for the next episode -- only to be letdown. The writing for the intro and conclusion was better than the actual meat of the story!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great journalism destroyed by ads

Kudos to the women and men who stayed on this story for so many years to make sure this pedophile didn‚Äôt get away with his crimes forever. Too bad this podcast ruins the story with intensely irritating ads in the middle of it. I will not buy/use any of those products‚Ä¶

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strong start, weak middle, no ending?

I was enjoying it but episode 4 and 5 have really dropped off for me in terms of quality and interest. It‚Äôs much less interesting content and it‚Äôs not very economically written. I think the plan was for it to feel like a cliffhanger but we got so little information. I feel like there was more intro and advertisements than content. 

Next episode is supposed to be the last one. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll listen. Maybe I will, at 2x on the bus if I can‚Äôt find anything more interesting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads make podcasts horrible

The monetization of podcasts have made it a horrible medium.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solid

Pretty solid podcast, styllllll

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very interesting

Always waiting for the next episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast

Are more episodes coming? Good podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Intriguing and well told but that theme song is terrible, I have to fast forward through it, it‚Äôs so cringey

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VELVET VOICE

Easy listening to a complex, fascinating tale of twisted megalomania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too Fast Paced

Interesting story but the content is gone through way too quickly.  Before you can absorb one terrible occurrence they have moved onto the next.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing

Such a good podcast, cannot believe this guy got away with all of this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good, but more actors needed

Very well researched and interesting. But this guy needs to get more people to do his re-enactments. He is often playing simultaneously multiple roles (including females), which is awkward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addictive

Wow..the pod is outstanding!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ad placement fail

Please have ads at beginning so we can skip them. No one likes a story being interrupted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must listen

Excellent and intriguing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great information well done

This podcast has great insight into the topics it reports on. Highly recommended it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank god

Thank god for real journalists and broadcasters like everyone involved in this project!
I will happily notify everyone I know to listen. 
Thanks for providing excellent content excellently presented!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love!

Loved the first episode! Can‚Äôt wait to keep listening

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbelievable

Great so far, can't wait for more episodes! Such a sick man

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ep 8 was very painful

Ep 8.. the interviewee was extremely painful to listen to..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow!

Scary stuff....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subscription Only!

It was really disappointing to get engrossed in the first few episodes, only to find that the remainder of the series required me to sign up to a subscription. This felt cynical and manipulative and makes me wary of embarking on other podcasts from the same company. Most podcasters (including Wondery) offer people the choice of free content being if they are willing to put up with adverts or, alternatively, an ad free subscription. This feels like an own goal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great but shame Wondrey now asking for payment

As above

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play 2 then must sign up

Like the previous person I don‚Äôt like that and I simply will not listen to any in future .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wondery Plus Scam?

Only giving 2/6 episodes for free to make people sign up to Wondery+? 
Not impressed. Was a massive fan of wondery podcasts but if this will be a normal thing I will not continue to listen!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Substance

The podcast is average 30 mins long and has 4-5 ads and almost zero substance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking and informative.

I enjoy wondery podcasts as you can learn the full scope of a story so easily and it‚Äôs entertaining as well. This podcast series was excellent as it‚Äôs about someone who we heard about so frequently in the news and an ongoing investigation. 

Wondery podcasts are perfect for me as I‚Äôm a student who has to commute to uni everyday and I can listen to an entertaining story at the same time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really good podcast

Although not the most detailed on the Epstein story the podcast delivery gives it a more gripping feel to other podcasts which keeps you thoroughly engaged. Really enjoyed this an would definitely recommend. Keep more coming please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So informative

Before listening to this pod cast I didn‚Äôt really know much about the Epstein case and I felt really ignorant to the facts of what happened once I listened. Really informative and I really enjoyed that background checks and research that went into this! Made me want to take note of what is really going on into how the other half really live. The adverts put a dampener on it however most podcasts do use adverts so it doesn‚Äôt really take away the tone of the story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent

Close but no cigar but if everything you could‚Äôve found you did actually put down well it‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg isn‚Äôt it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant. Utterly engaging.

Beautifully presented. Extremely professional and well researched. Wholly recommend this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great content, easy to digest

Content is great and well delivered by the narrator. Number of episodes and length of each are about right too. Highly recommend

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thought Provoking,

Like many others I probably thought I knew the Epstein story and that memorable morning when I woke up to find he had ‚Äúcommitted suicide‚Äù I did think, yeah right. This excellent work makes you consider how rotten the people who swore to protect society were? are? We can but hope the truth will out. Depressingly this tells the tale of a man who thumbed his nose at the Law and got away with it too often, for too long. Lady Justice must have wanted to fall on her own sword. Plaudits to the victims who spoke up, the journalists and law enforcement who at personal risk championed them and stood up and the producers/presenters of podcasts like this who keep the injustice forefront In our minds and aim dig beyond redaction and spin. Excellent podcast! Can‚Äôt recommend enough!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far more depth to this story than I knew

This is an extremely depressing but brilliant listen. It‚Äôs so good to hear about the diligence of those who brought the truth about this man and his blatant criminal behaviour to light.  Hiding in plain sight among some of the worlds most powerful people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

I didn‚Äôt really know much about this case, so found it very interesting to listen to an in-depth review. However there are quite a few adverts (which I know can‚Äôt be helped) that were the same and it would‚Äôve been nice to have more variety.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Longtime listener

Not sure why this needed to exist- weird format departure from American scandal, which this series should surely just been a part of. It also suffers from more going back and forth then is usual in the AS series, and could probably have benefitted from a more chronological focus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many ads

Good podcast ruined by the obscene number of adverts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good content but ads are overwhelming!

Difficult to follow in amongst the ads and promos for other podcasts!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

Very interesting and detailed, would recommend .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is this just one long advert?!

This would be a great podcast series if it wasn‚Äôt 50% adverts and teasers for the next episode or other shows....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How has this happened....

Well written and well presented! a disgusting story of wealth and what it seems to let you do! I hope this leads to arrests and prison time as they deserve it! And I hope the young women get their lives back from these pigs ‚ù§Ô∏è

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frustrating listening.

Hard for me to rate the actual content of the podcast. I‚Äôve listened to 4 episodes and barely heard one episode‚Äôs worth, the volume of adverts is too much. Coupled with ‚Äòstill to come‚Äô skits and chatter about other podcasts, this makes listening a chore, before you‚Äôve even thought about the bleak subject matter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prince Andrew!

You need to update this podcast post the BBC‚Äôs interview with Andrew.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbelievable

Genuinely staggering how wealth and power enables someone to do what the hell they like. Hopefully with reporting and careful assembling of the facts like this, awareness will increase and prosecutions will follow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many Ads

Really interesting but the advertising ruins the listening experience..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really long ads

Far too much of this is advertising.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good

A must listen. The only thing I would say that could be improved is that at some points the adverts slip in and confuse the story. At a few points I didn‚Äôt realise that it was an advert.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline confusing

Enjoying so far but it‚Äôs difficult to keep up with what‚Äôs happened before or if we‚Äôre jumping back in time or forward. Think there should be a quick recap before each episode perhaps. Just doesn‚Äôt seem to be going in a coherent timeline so I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait, what?‚Äù

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scumbags

How many other scumbags like Epstein, Maxwell and Windsor are out there degrading teenagers?  Wonderys usual outstanding storytelling based on meticulous research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely Brilliant

Only four episodes in but have listened to them one after another, it‚Äôs unreal stuff. More brilliant work from Wondry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to listen to this!

This series really gets into the details of what went on with Epstein. It makes be angry and sad really that he and his associates got away with it for so long. And how is Maxwell still walking free!!!!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, so good

Seriously, can‚Äôt believe there are people out there who behave so despicably and get away with it did so long. It‚Äôs an education to listen to this podcast and is sickening to think what money can buy. 
Good podcast, voice over, clear facts and informative. Enjoying it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BROKEN: the original and better Epstein pod

I‚Äôm actually surprised at wondery for not QCing this. Tragic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent story

Informative story very well narrated but the amount of adverts is off putting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruined by so many ads

Far too many ads. Stopped listening. Pity as the content is good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking stuff - great podcast

Lindsay does a fantastic job of narrating one of the most harrowing abuse storys of our time. It really shines a light on the abuse of powers, minipulation of wealth and the social injustic that faces women. Interesting podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads endless make it impossible to listen

Intrusive endless adverts

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just see 2 episodes...

Where can i find the rest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Absolutely a fascinating podcast about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the trail of terror that they have left behind. However, lots of unanswered questions unfortunately remain for his victims and investigators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectacular reporting on the heaviest of facts

I listened in one ride.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shame about the ads

I like the content and quality but I absolutely hate the ads, they are very long and most annoying they are told by the same voice as the podcast so it is hard to tell the difference between the ad and the content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well researched and narrated, the amount of commercials is crazy and annoying

As title says. It's a shame

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice podcast but so. Many. Ads

The podcast is great, but the ads are so annoying, about 3 /4 per episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series full of suspense

Great podcast series full of suspense with the right cadence and all the information packed together for a full view of all these surreal events that took place. Highly recommend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really Well Told

Thank you again Lindsay Graham for a thrilling chilling story. I wish Mr Epstein didn‚Äôt die and had to face the consequences and shame. Interesting that he would rather die than face up to his ruined reputation. Priorities I suppose.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast!

The mysterious Mr Epstein is a very appropriate title. There are many theories on how he made his millions/ billions but there is no clean cut story. I like that this podcast investigates his background. Providing a more complex story, compared to current documentaries that just feature the victims account. It becomes very repetitive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant

Love this guys podcasts. Excellent as usual

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you

It‚Äôs heartening to know there are people out there who will stand up to ‚Äúthe rich & famous‚Äù & make them accountable. Well done & keep it up!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant series

Thank you for this immersive and intriguing in-depth look into the chilling life and times of JE. 

The production is excellent and evocative through the subtle sound fx, music and narration. 

In content, it rightly leaves many important questions unanswered about how the worlds most powerful people have not been bought to justice. 
However it fills in and provides a richly detailed timeline of his life and pattern of manipulation and abuse. 
These days who needs the golden age of tv when material like this is at hand. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too much advertising of other wondery podcasts

Enjoy the podcast but the length of ads and advertising of other wondery podcasts leaves little time for the actual subject to be covered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best in-depth narrative of Epstein

From his beginnings, perpetrating his first large fraud, to how he became known as a mathematic and scientific genius (although questionable), through to his ultimate downfall. It does seem as if he always had protection, regardless of the crime - it does cause pause as to who or what was his real benefactor/s and if they decided to terminate him as he had become too much of an unmanageable liability and had outlived his use since the risk of continuing to protect him was not worth the ROI and the risk of possible exposure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brilliant storytelling

Smooth, easy narration style coupled with just the right balance of story and description. Brilliant podcast, thanks Wondery!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome

Awesome

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Clinton was not left out like some of these idiot Trumpers are claiming. Epstein hung out with both Clinton and Trump and the podcast covers both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Don‚Äôt listen to this whiny trumpers. Lindsay does it again. Well researched. Great podcast. Highly recommended for everyone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top-notch research and excellent presentation! Definitely listen!!

I am VERY picky about podcasts and I positively DEVOURED this one in one day! It‚Äôs a fascinating and unflinching- not to mention horrifying!- post-mortem of Epstein‚Äôs life, crimes, and ultimate death. Each episode fearlessly strips away the mountains of excuses and ‚Äúbuck-passing‚Äù of those who should and could have stopped the monster and lays bare the legal/judicial failings and free passes, financial shell games, extortion, and intricate web of political and personal grooming, manipulation, pay-offs, pattern of trading favors with those in power, and careful coercive control employed by Epstein to amass his fortune and gain his ‚ÄúUntouchable‚Äù status. The importance of this examination cannot be overstated! While the subject matter is often difficult to listen to, he is always respectful of the survivors of Epstein‚Äôs reprehensible crimes and we need to know how this happened in order to ensure that it never happens again, and it‚Äôs plain that THAT is the mission of this podcast. 
The narration is engaging, -he doesn‚Äôt go off on too many tangents but he does interject at some points with appropriate comments that you‚Äôre almost certainly thinking yourself (for example, if there‚Äôs a quote from someone who‚Äôs lying through their teeth, he‚Äôll say something like, ‚ÄúCOME ON! We ALL know that‚Äôs a lie!‚Äù)- fast-paced, always clear, and easy to follow. With the energy of a drama, you will almost definitely be yelling at whichever device you‚Äôre using to listen to this podcast at pretty much every twist and turn!! I HIGHLY recommend this podcast, both for those who followed the story as it unfolded, as well as those who are thinking, ‚ÄúJeffery who?‚Äù 
Absolute 10/10 from me!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt..

Kill himself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tainted information

Another example of people being obsessed with including Trump in every topic. Enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing and personally horrifying.üïäÔ∏è

Ep 7 is real!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listen

Listen, just try it if you are just trying to get a broad sense of what happened with short, informational podcast then try this one. I love Linsey Gram and the story telling is great. So if you are looking for a deep dive that goes over every detail then try something else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agenda

I‚Äôm a fan of Lindsey Graham BUT, Very disappointed that Men involved aka Clinton / Hollywood were left out!  Trump had very limited interaction as opposed to Gates and Clinton and he is mentioned repeatedly hmmmm - very very disappointed to see the ‚Äúagenda‚Äù at work here!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not worth it

Starts out excellent then you have to pay, and content promptly goes into the toilet. Mostly hearsay and opinions, not data, from then on. The woman in session 7 is awful. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre listening to a high school student/school newspaper reporter. (I think I should get a refund of 25c for every time she said ‚Äúlike‚Äù‚Ä¶.) Lastly, politics plays a more prominent role than it should. It‚Äôs fine to bash Trump, but what about Clinton? What about all the other CEOs and billionaires?  You referenced them dozens of time but never said who, or what they did, save Elon Musk. The liberal elite have to finger wag‚Ä¶. I would have really appreciated a deep dive into the national security aspect of the story, not just one former FBI agent‚Äôs opinion. Disappointing Lindsay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointed

It was interesting, however, I am not impressed with how you were sure to mention Trump numerous times but were very limited with your Clinton mentions. I am not a Trump fan and obviously neither are you. I can see how it affected your story here. No mention of the painting of Clinton.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Money for Nothing

And here I thought I would LOVE Wondery. 
  Nope. Just another group of people benefiting from Jeff Epstein. If putting the truth out there was the most important thing‚Ä¶
 You would‚Äônt be charging people hard earned money that they most likely work tireless hours to support their families & use your platform to help them get thru that grueling work day/night. 
 If you are not going to allow listeners to enjoy the full shows, then STOP trying to bait ppl into paying you for information they can get elsewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank God I listen to this before the subscriptions kicked in

Once was free and now you have to pay for it another podcast to delete

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pay? No thanks!

Could be something interesting here if listeners weren‚Äôt asked to pay to listen. Another subscription app isn‚Äôt what we need. All episodes should be free. If the real purpose is to expose Epstein and his accomplices, everyone should have access to this information. Don‚Äôt be greedy Wondery!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bait and switch

Great job covering a lot of the details left out in shorter versions however it‚Äôs essentially only two podcasts long‚Ä¶.Unless you want to join their subscription service that they don‚Äôt tell you about till episode 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deceitful

1) You should make it clear that the rest of it is not free - don‚Äôt bait and switch. Who decided from your team that a few dollars are worth your listeners deep disappointment.
2) The writing is not gripping and is hard to follow - has a feeling of a kid telling you about their day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good not great

Two of the eight episodes are free and then you must pay. I‚Äôm able to use my free trial to finish it, but I don‚Äôt think it was worth paying for. Pretty obvious they are trying to use this story to make money off of. Grifting. Guess that‚Äôs the nature of some of these podcasts; short on information, long on advertising. 
Good surface level information and at least they touch on the conspiracy surrounding his death. 
I doubt anything will come of it. The people that murdered Epstein will never be held accountable; just like the people who enabled him and benefited from his perversion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Y‚Äôall can‚Äôt give up Trump

Two minutes in and already there‚Äôs Trump trashing. I don‚Äôt love the guy but this is pathetic. Unsubscribing to Wondery. Y‚Äôall ruin so many potentially great podcasts by needlessly interjecting politics. Get a life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 7

Worst person to interview. How is this woman a journalist? I could not stand to listen to her voice, her cadence and the overall tone were awful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time for a break up

Wondery you were my go to for podcasts. Key word‚Ä¶ were. I‚Äôm not paying to listen. Sorry

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointing pay wall

I love a lot of the Wondery content and would not paying a small subscription fee but their fee structure is insane and there are way too many terrible ads. It‚Äôs almost as bad as listening to network TV or ESPN. Lost another customer Wondery. Congrats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episodes do not match descriptions

There seems to be something wrong with the organization of this podcast. Multiple episodes do not match their descriptions, and there seem to be episodes missing. Could‚Äôve been really interesting, but it‚Äôs just confusing‚Ä¶

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Podcast

I listen to a lot of podcasts. This is interesting and informative. Epstein was sick, and a predator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way too many ads

While the content is engaging and well presented, the unbelievable number of commercials is disappointing. This channel is usually pretty reasonable, but with this show, it almost feels like they‚Äôre taking a page out of Mr. E‚Äôs book to make money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pathetic

You have to pay for episodes and considering they are 15 minutes or less, it‚Äôs filled with half ads. Just don‚Äôt do the podcast if this is how it has to be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super disappointing

I cannot believe that there‚Äôs a fee to listen to the podcast! Don‚Äôt put free ones on the podcast & then show that there are others ONLY if you pay!!! This is awful! I‚Äôm super disappointed that Wondery has chosen this route. Truthfully there are tons of commercials during each episode so why would you now have all these special episodes shown for people who pay? Guess it‚Äôs more about the money?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally went and did it

Subscription fee? Yeah, I‚Äôm done now. I‚Äôve been a big fan of wondery up until now. 
So disappointing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Netflix

The content on Wondery can be excellent or mediocre. For a bit more money I could get a streaming service with tons more content. This is a joke. BTW, I‚Äôd pay $1 or $2 a month for podcasts, but ya‚Äôll have lost the plot and lost another listener. Good luck with your bad choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh wow.

Came to check out and just read the reviews to find you have to pay for it now‚Ä¶sucks. Won‚Äôt be listening anymore. Not worth that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

Not paying for 15 min of content lol. Good one wondery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fool me once.

And I really liked Wondery podcasts. SMH‚Ä¶

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Couldn‚Äôt finish series.

Sheisty move.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major Ripoff

Just another sly attempt for another subscription.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bait and switch

See above reviews

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scam to buy

Disappointing. As a huge fan of Wondery- I expected better and now won‚Äôt listen to any other items from you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paywall

First two episodes free then Wondery wants you to pay for the rest. If you‚Äôre not going to offer it for free just be upfront about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing episodes - behind a paywall?

I was only able to download 2 episodes.  At first I thought they were still producing/releasing episodes.   Now I see it‚Äôs part of a bait & switch scheme. I‚Äôm surprised Apple tolerates this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This story should be free

See above

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where are the rest?

You really want me to subscribe to a paid subscription service to listen to episodes three thru eight? Y‚Äôall not that special. Literally just search Epstein and you can pick any other podcast and do a better job. What a waste of my time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trash to make you pay to listen to the full story..

It is not cool to make you have to pay and subscribe to Wondrys app and podcast to listen to all of the episodes. I already pay apple enough money, and now to hear you tell stories, I have to pay while others tell it for free? No thanks. That‚Äôs dumb, and a rip off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks Apple

If Wondery wants to give us two episodes only and then switch us over to their pay service that is fine. But I fault Apple for not letting us know upfront that this is going to happen. Why would Apple allow only two episodes to be available? This is why I stick with trusted news organizations for my true crime podcasts and not for-profit production companies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can‚Äôt listen

What a mess. Can‚Äôt listen to all episodes in the series without jumping across multiple platforms (apple, Spotify, wondery site). When your business model is to get listener streams so you can sell ads and collect data, gotta do better to make sure people can even find you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here we go again

Once again the Epstein story is stopped before we get the entire picture. Did the production on this get suisided too? Or scared? Or threatened? Might as well just delete this podcast because it literally stops 1/10th of way in. Either way I guess we will never really find someone brave enough to tell the world the whole story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many commercial interruptions

Good story but way too many commercial interruptions which disturb the flow. Couldve been shortened to 2 episodes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abrupt end?

Good but What happened? This podcast stopped in the middle of telling the story. That‚Äôs ridiculous you should at least post a podcast letting your followers know that you‚Äôre not going to be posting anymore. Otherwise we will not follow the originator and all the rest of their podcasts because I assume they will all end the same way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sign up for wonders plus?

I want to listen to the rest of the Jeffrey Epstein podcast. How can ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AbruptlyEnded

This was a pretty good podcast (coming from someone who doesn't really enjoy podcasts), but it abruptly ended. Lots of commercials which were annoying. Are there more episodes to come?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
what happened to the reat of this podcast?

Was there supposed to be more?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt Bother

They give you the first two episodes for free and then try to get you to pay for the rest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incomplete series

Only 2 episodes available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only two episodes?

Where are the rest of the episodes? This podcast is very well done and interesting and I would have given it a five star rating if there were more episodes. I felt like I was just left with an unfinished story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6 episodes?

Where are the rest of the episodes?!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing episodes?

Probably would have rated this 5 stars, but the final 4 episodes are missing across platforms, including Apple podcasts, Spotify, and even on the Wondery website itself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where did the episodes go?

There‚Äôs 1, 2 and 9. What‚Äôs this about?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is the rest of the series?

What happened?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where did they go?

Had recently listened to all episodes. Went back to go over them again and can only get to 2. What happened?!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why does it only have Episodes 1 and 2?

The host says it‚Äôs a six episode series. But all you get are the trailer and episodes 1 and 2. Where is the rest of the series and why isn‚Äôt it available??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing episodes

Episodes3-4 won‚Äôt play. Totally ruined it for me :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What happened to the last episodes?

I listened to this all yesterday, got to the last episode and it‚Äôs ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missing episodes?

It was really informative and interesting the first two episodes, but it stops there? I‚Äôm assuming episode two isn‚Äôt where the story ends? A little disappointed that the others aren‚Äôt available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

It‚Äôs ok but I thought it would add something more than the Netflix doc. It didn‚Äôt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too biased

I listened to two episodes. This is so biased I couldn‚Äôt listen to anymore. If you‚Äôre going to be reporters, you need to be courageous enough to to tell the WHOLE truth instead of excluding facts about people you like and trying to point to others you don‚Äôt... just like what you‚Äôre saying happened in Epstein‚Äôs life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein Podcast

This was so well done.  Very informative and frightening to listen too.  There was so much cover-up- which is truly a reality in the world of the rich.

I wish they would use females for the female roles.  It‚Äôs annoying to have a make voice playing a female.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BLM

Great story!!! But These cops are out of control really.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worth the listen

Feel much more informed. Very succinct coverage of the story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 7 - hmmm

Where is episode 7?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A real friend

You don‚Äôt have nearly enough on the friendship of Clinton and Epstein. Clinton was a oversexed horn dog and of course eppy got him all the fun he needed on his private island. Why else would Clinton go there dozens of times?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
W

What a story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One Big Omission

A good series that gives the basics on Epstein. The podcast conveniently leaves out Robert Maxwell‚Äôs ties to Mossad and Epstein‚Äôs ties to the Israeli government. This information was used to blackmail powerful people around the world by the Israeli government. Members of the tribe must have been involved with this production.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where‚Äôs episode 7!?!

Anybody else not able to see episode 7????

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the mysterious mr epstein

excellent couldn‚Äôt stop listening

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton NOT Trump

Please do your research because if you did then you would know Clinton went to the island 26 times & has a portrait of himself in the Monica Blue dress hanging in his house liar. Trump barred Epstein from His premises 13 years ago after he was reported to have groped someone. What is wrong with you?? Stop lying about our President it‚Äôs disgusting.  Trump was the only one who helped the FBI bust Epstein too.  Please collect your little gold star from the Left later at the DNC you hack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pedestrian

If this were the only thing written or recorded about the Epstein affair, it would be good. But it‚Äôs not, far from it, and adds nothing to the public understanding of how or why any of this happened. 

Notably, the podcast at best scratches the surface of some of the largest question marks that hang over the case: where did Epstein get his money and why did the authorities give him so many free passes. 

If you know nothing about the Epstein case, go ahead and listen.. otherwise take a pass

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good, but...

Talked about everything! And it was so entertaining. Clearly, Pres. Trump and J.E. were not friends. Acquaintances? Yes! But friends... no. Never did the Pres. travel anywhere with him, the victims never saw him, there‚Äôs no proof they were ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Former Pres. Clinton went to the island a dozen and a half times, he was seen by the victims... Clear proof of a friendship. You‚Äôre only trying to smear Pres. Trump‚Äôs character. Bad reporting in that topic and totally not necessary!! This was a great series, it didn‚Äôt need that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bias

Starts out with an Anti Trump agenda.. no longer listen to this podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
odd add choice

we‚Äôre talking about a serial billionaire and you choose a best fiends sponsor? Odd threw me off. Other than that good podcast

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just BRILLIANCE

heard every Podcast on this issue but this one straight forward no BS takes the Crown. ‚ö°Ô∏è

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 7

What happened to episode 7..... ???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WONDERY Please Stop Using New Episode for Ad Placement

The Apple podcast app has a nice feature that notifies us when a new episode is released.  So what does WONDERY do?  Uses this feature to advertise new podcasts.  Which is TOTALLY awful when you are subscribed to  5 or 10 WONDERY podcasts!  You get 5 or 10 notifications which APPEAR to be alerts for new episodes...  only they are a crappy ADVERTISEMENT for the SAME new podcast!  

So in turn I will use THIS podcast to RATE my displeasure in the practice... ONE STAR.  Touch√©.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Always pick Wondry

Another great (yet gross) story told by the great team at Wondry. If it‚Äôs a Wondry podcast, you know it‚Äôs going to be good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great reporting

The Epstein story is a heck of an illustration for the age we live in. Profundly corrupt minds. Money catching all kind of fish in its trawling net. Fish of all stripes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another good one from Wondery.

Great journalism. Helping me get through a day of tedious work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 7?

Anyone know before I get engrossed in the podcast if there supposed to be an episode 7?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is episode 7?

Can you guys check and add back episode 7? Thanks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trump

Really sick of the Trump bashing.  They try soo hard to tie Trump to creepy Einstein.  We all know it‚Äôs the Clintons- Bill flew on his jet more than 20 times.  Girls have confirmed Clinton molested them in depositions. It has been made clear over and over that Trump wasn‚Äôt invoked with Epstein‚Äôs child rape and never went to his island.  The trump bashing is so over played. I wish the media didn‚Äôt have to report everything with TDS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Podcast

Great podcast, thank you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bish

I like it.... I like it a lot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 7 ?

Where did episode 7 go? I listened to it on Sunday, July 7, 2020. I wanted to listen to it again and couldn‚Äôt find it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great listening

A modern day horror story but well covered & narrated. Praying for some form of justice for the many victims of these horrible heartless humans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dying for Sex

I have lost two husbands to cancer
and can identify with this story on so many points. I was Molly after the first time when I was 42 and had been married for 24 years. I was so at loose ends and wanted a connection of some kind and needed crazy sex all the time. I did things I would never had dreamed I could do and have never regretted my choices. After my second husband of 22 years  died, I was much more sane and had had such a fulfilling marriage with him, I feel no one else could ever have my heart again. He will have it forever. After having had eight years of being wild and crazy, I had married the soulmate I had always dreamed of since my youth. Even though he has been gone for six years, he is with me every day  and I look for his guidance in everything I do. Congrats on doing a podcast that shows the humorous side of cancer, because you need plenty of humor to endure what the different stages bring.  You also captured the rawness of this gut-wrenching disease that makes you feel inside out at so many times during the journey. Everyone wishes to have you as a best friend.   I loved this poignant story. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review

Love listening to Lindsay. Always so interesting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREAT speaker!

Awesome speaker and story!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well researched

If you know anything  about this world, you may learn more , and if you don‚Äôt you are in for a ride.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent!

Well told. Excellent reporting of facts. Can‚Äôt wait for follow ups to this story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

I found this very interesting but was curious why Trump was brought up in the story. He was not part of the story. I would have been more curious why Clinton was involved and more serious part of a connection between the two men.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revealing!

I look forward to any Wondery podcast, but this one is especially important and revealing as this nation learns more about - and begins to accept - coercive control and male privilege as a REAL thing. Please listen and share!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

Excellent podcast! I highly recommend listening to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smear journalism

Is this podcast about how horrible Jeff E. was or is this yet another chance to smear the President?  Just stick to the facts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disgustingly fantastic podcast

Another 5 star podcast from Wondery - can‚Äôt recommend this enough. The story telling is excellent and gives enough detail to keep you listening but not so much that you get lost or bored. The only thing that could have made it better is if Jeffrey Epstein would have suffered all of the pain & anguish that his victims did.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for releasing this

More people need to understand that this story is one of the most important ones in the time we live in. Very glad that this project was completed and I think more people need to look into this. Some of the worlds highest ranking members of society are taking part in the things that are discussed in this podcast, and I‚Äôm glad people are finally starting to pay attention.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wondery has done it again!

Wondery never disappoints. More series ASAP! Lol

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done

Pair this with the Netflix doc to get a complete picture. I was hopeful this podcast would fill in some missing pieces and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Politically one sided

I listened to 5 minutes before I grew tired of the one-sided political agenda that was being pushed. It was well known Epstein was a big ally of the Clintons with pictures and flight logs. Yet we are hearing about Trump in the entire beginning of the first episode. No thank you. I‚Äôll move on from Wondery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything is coming clear...

Wow!  So much more to this story! Does Atty General Barr have the Epstein files and photos?  Hmmmm....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More!!!

Everything from Wondery is amazing- great investigative journalism, such detail and info. Just want more!!! Waiting for a follow up because this story is far from over- more about Epstein‚Äôs death and the other players- and where is Maxwell now?!?! But this was great as always

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is the podcast?

I enjoyed listening to the podcast itself but the ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù has turned into a way to constantly advertise new podcasts I don‚Äôt care about. No new episodes, just constant ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù that are only commercials. #makeitstop

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Murder

Epstein was murdered not suicide

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sickening and compelling

This was very well done. I think this clearly   shows how society as a whole would improve if sexual assault was taken more seriously. Sadly, the reality of the ultra rich being virtually untouchable by the law is an ever-present reality. I think they need to go after more of his conspirators. That Maxwell woman should at least be charged with sex trafficking. And aren‚Äôt the Virgin Islands a US territory? How the eff was there not an IMMEDIATE investigation when the feds heard of a place called pedo island? It sounds like people were talking about it for years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

Loved it!!!!  Intriguing at its best
Great jobüëçüèº

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just ok

I was hoping this would be in-depth and informative but it just felt cursory and obvious.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing!

This podcast was one of my FAVORITES!! Such an amazing job! üëèüèº

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love it too

Nice job

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GRAHAM IS AWESOME

Love Lindsay Graham - he has a great voice and is a Fantastic narrator. Also- his podcasts and material he reports on is very well researched and told in such an amazing way!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cocklebur

Very good presentation without leading the listeners into definite conclusions.  Did Epstein commit suicide or was he murdered? What were the involvement of Clinton, Trump the British Royalty, et al?  This series presents the facts and allows listeners to decide. Very entertaining and informative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Democrat Hypocrisy At It‚Äôs Finest

Let‚Äôs be realistic Epstein‚Äôs dirty Kaunda was only coming to light now because MSM and Democrat pedo‚Äôs thought they could bring down trump. Once they realized it was actually the Clintons and their corrupt partners in the DNC THAT were the sickos the story was dropped. Shameful hopefully Americans demand answers and the nasty molesters get exposed regardless of party affiliations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Politics

Well done show, but one of the ugliest parts about this is the ONLY reason this investigation was reopened was the hope that this could somehow be used use to hurt President Trump. Reason why this investigation has fizzled out now is due to Epstein‚Äôs ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù and his exposed intimate relationship with Bill Clinton, which didn‚Äôt fit the media narrative. Had the picture of the man with his arm around Epstein‚Äôs mistress been Trump instead of Clinton, it would‚Äôve been on the front of every newspaper in the country. But it wasn‚Äôt. Hypocrisy at it‚Äôs finest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not biased! (Yet)

Before getting into this series I read the reviews and saw many that complained that Trump was cast in a negative light and Clinton wasn‚Äôt mentioned at all. Clinton is actually mentioned quite a bit in the first 15 minutes of episode 3. They even mentioned that he went to the island Little St James 26 times. If you‚Äôre someone reading the reviews and are hesitant about this series being politically biased, take a listen for yourself. I just finished episode 3 and have not seen any problems other reviews have pointed out and I was specifically listening for them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The intro song was unbearable

Lindsay does a good job and its an easy series to listen to. But lord have mercy, that intro and outro song is the wooooorst.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself

They‚Äôre perpetuating the lie. He did not kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phenomenal in-depth look

All I knew about Epstein before was what I‚Äôd read about his ‚Äúsuicide.‚Äù This was fascinating and horrifying and sickening and necessary. Pulled me in and I listened in a straight shot. I love Wondery‚Äôs stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informative

Great series of the case and its conclusions.

Thank you for your informative investigative reporting!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let‚Äôs call it what it is

Great Podcast! 
Could you please encourage your guests and presenters to call rape and sexual assault by those terms. Epstein and his ilk raped, sexually molested and sexually assaulted children and women. They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave sex with underage woman or girls‚Äù, they raped women and children. 
He was charged with solicitation of ‚Äúunderage prostitution‚Äù which is not possible as a child cannot consent to prostitution. 
Thank you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
good show

Thank you!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truth and lies is MUCH better

If you want a good podcast on Epstein. Listen to a Truth and Lies. This is all over the place and hard to follow. I‚Äôm also not a fan when stories are told in present tense.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maxwell was the real killer

If Trump is so smart, why is she still alive ?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The privilege of wealth, not maleness.

I enjoyed this podcast as much as one can enjoy a podcast about sexual trafficking of minors and the outright evil and debauchery perpetrated by Epstein. It stuck mostly to facts and gave us victims‚Äô accounts while also presenting the ‚Äúother side‚Äù of these allegations. I have no doubt that Epstein was guilty. I also am suspicious about his alleged suicide. On the last episode, one of the podcasters indicated that Jeffrey Epstein is an example of unchecked male privilege and the patriarchy; this is where I rolled my eyes and checked out. Epstein is an example of our culture‚Äôs obsession with wealth, the depravity of many men and women‚Äôs sexual inclinations (remember Epstein had a female partner in rape and trafficking), and how money can buy power. For the podcasters to cast this into the bucket of third wave feminist jargon and the talking points of political activism is ludicrous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far, so good.

I‚Äôm just here to say his island is called Little St James not Little St Jeffs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power at the highest level

Listening to this profile analysis is incredibly similar to our president‚Äôs profile and the abuses of power involved in covering up his crimes. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Probably should‚Äôve been one episode.

Very interesting but was painfully stretched out into 6 episodes. Should have been one longer episode. Lots of recapping what was covered in previous episodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh‚Ä¶.

Wasn‚Äôt all that impressed with this one, basically a rehash of the journalism already done on this case. And man that theme song is absolutely one of the most annoying I have ever heard, ‚Äúwashed my hands in muddy water‚Äù watttt?????

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Couldn‚Äôt stop listening

Prepare to be infuriated by the Epstein‚Äôs privilege and the corruption of law enforcement. I‚Äôm glad this story is being told.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent - a must listen!

Money, power and pure evil by not only by Epstein but many many more ! Ms. Maxwell should be in jail as well. Sadly Epsteins death will leave several guilty people associated with him free and ‚Äúoff the hook‚Äù.  Thank you for doing this podcast and thank you to the women who spoke up and continue to speak out against sexual trafficking!! You are the definition of HERO!!! If you witness human trafficking you MUST report it! These children deserve protection.  Episode 7 is excellent !!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself

It was a good listen until you failed to even investigate or discuss the massive coverup this was.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you

Thank you for exposing all these very disturbing details.  We must continue to fight back and not allow money and power to ruin the lives of children!!!  Everything about this disturbing information makes me so angry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very Good

I listened to the Spotify podcast on Jeffrey Epstein first and then came over to this one. This one is excellent and fills in a lot of holes; like how his earned his wealth, why Epstein was interested in that young lady, the Artist,  paintings, etc. . Really loved this podcast.  Ok, for those who believe Trump is innocent, Stop!  Trump has been pretty quiet about he and Jeffreys friendship.  Any other time, Trump will provide details of why he doesn't like someone but he‚Äôs closed mouth.  They actually hung out before the friendship dissolved.  I believe Jeffrey outsmarted Trump on a Business deal.  Jreffey was a piece is &hit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great listen yet disturbing

I really like this podcast because it quick and straight to the point. It can be disturbing to listen to at times so please be aware. The podcast does a good job in describing and providing details of who Epstein was. Interviews can be emotional and informative of who Epstein was to these victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good but doesn‚Äôt line up

I thought this was great up to episode 6. You said when Epstein was first on suicide watch there was nothing that could Cause him to commit suicide, sheets that can‚Äôt be tied into a noose. Then the second time he was put on suicide watch he was able to tie a sheet to the bed and strangled himself. Doesn‚Äôt make sense. New York is corrupt and should be held accountable for his death. No way 2 guards fell asleep at the same time, and him having 3 broken bones? Naww don‚Äôt believe this hocus pocus story. Epstein was a horrible individual but the truth should not be covered up. Just because ‚Äújustice‚Äù to some came forward, let‚Äôs get an actual story and hold the New York correction center accountable, especially the guards that murdered him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The experts episode was trash

I‚Äôm not here for 24/7 new cycle bs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can‚Äôt Stop Listening

I wish I could stop binging, because Im appalled and disgusted by Epstein, Maxwell and all involved. Child sex trafficking is a HARD topic to listen to. But this story desperately needs to be told, and actual justice needs to be served where justice is due. Well done to Wondery and host Lindsey Graham! You are my heroes for addressing such a crucial epidemic in the US, and around the world.

True Crime Podcast

Hard to follow

The content is great and the information is incredible but the editing was horrible. It‚Äôs hard to distinguish when the commercials start and end. The jumping around all over the place doesnt help.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truth

Jeffrey Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be prepared

To hear horrible things and get really angry.  A well reported and interesting story.  It is horrifying what rich well connected people get away with.  Horrifying that these things can happen and still can be happening.  We need to hold our daughters closer and teach them to be strong and independent and stand up to this crap.  I feel for all the victims and what they went through and sorry for the justice they can never receive.  All though I echo that I fully believe that man is not dead and maybe justice will be served.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super- but missing ONE impt thing

I loved everything but here‚Äôs what‚Äôs missing... if/since Jeff was likely a US Asset... and given that he never was held responsible- WHY WOULD WE THINK HE IS DEAD?? 
Clearly he was swapped out with a dead look alike- this seems SO OBVIOUS. 
Why wouldn‚Äôt this be discussed?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laura ruined the finale

How many times is laura gonna plug her show. She focused a lot on gender - patriarchy -  hello sick is sick and the enabler was apparently his girlfriend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great reporting

Couldn‚Äôt stop listening!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WOW - great listen

I couldn‚Äôt stop listening!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Binged in one day

Very well told story. How he got away with all of this over all that time is just absolutely crazy. Great job on creating this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton

There‚Äôs literally no mention of Clinton. They spent some minutes on Trump, great, but there‚Äôs only so much you can say about that‚Äîthere‚Äôs that one clip of the two dancing. Clinton traveled overland 20 times to Epstein‚Äôs island, and literally nothing about that is mentioned. Otherwise informative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton‚Äôs must have sponsored this

He‚Äôs tied to a bunch of liberal democrats, they killed him because they‚Äôre all pedophiles too üíØ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listen to episode 7

Be sure to listen to the bonus episode! It fills in the gaps in episode 6 (Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not much

Another Clinton coverup
Where will the liberal hate of Trump end?
Never by the fake news hypocrites

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intriguing! Loved this podcast.

This was exceptional. The life of this man was disgusting and I do hope the victims get some sort of justice after all this is said and done. It will take years unfortunately. Great podcast, thanks for all the hard work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fantastic!

Fanatic show! Well told and very informative. I liked the voice of the narrator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truth

Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biased Garbage

If you hate Trump, this is for you. If you want the truth, skip it. I made it to Episode 3 before I deleted the season. They consistently make references and attempt to tie Epstein and Trump, with minimal passing mention of the fact Trump didn‚Äôt like Epstein and barred him from Mar A Lago. Furthermore, there was even less mentioned of good friend and frequent ‚ÄúLolita Express‚Äù flier Clinton. So, again, only listen if you enjoy being lied to and hate Trump.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intriguing

Well done,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm disappointed

Once again wondering is a great podcast but we all know he got killed let‚Äôs be honest murdered in his cell

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Truth

Thank you for sharing the truth. Also, Epstein did not kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
too biased for liberal viewpoints

Good podcast, but focuses on unimportant matters and ignores some bigger deals. Horrible to hear about these stories though, disappointing to hear about the corruption and evil among the elite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical issues

I like the wondery podcasts I‚Äôve listened to in the past, I‚Äôve given them all 4 or 5. Today I have tried to listen to 4 different new wondery podcasts and none of them will load. It‚Äôs not the app bc all my other podcasts work. Hate to leave a bad review not based on the content, just trying to get the message out so hopefully I can continue to listen to your entertaining podcasts. Thanks keep up the good work. 
P.S. I‚Äôll make up for this 3 star review with 5 star reviews for other podcasts once they start working

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Money = power

Great podcast, absolutely will infuriate you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent podcast

I listen to many podcasts & this is one of the best a must !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great and informative

I enjoyed this podcast a lot! Lots of new (to me) info.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A good listen

Interesting podcast on this story. Well done!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good till the end

Loved the series till episode 7. The last guest ruined it for me, but the rest of the series was illuminating on Epstein‚Äôs background and past

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow

WOW. This podcast sheds so much light on such a complicated case. This is wonderfully narrated and provides great insights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waste of time !

Great show if you like to listen to commercials. Too bad because there is so much more information easily available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking that it‚Äôs all true

This podcast really hits home and shows you what the people in our world have really been up to. I hope they all keep getting caught. So happy Prince Andrew has been pushed back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What happened to episode 2??

I was in the middle of episode two and it completely disappeared!!!???!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be continued....

It may be 6 episodes now, but the story does not end here. What about his will being filled in the V.I. two days before his death to 1953 foundation. Where are the assets of this foundation? And where is Grislaine Maxwell?
What about her assets? 
No-one was surprised by Epstein not making it to trial.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Until the End

Great series until episode 7. I almost stopped at 6 and now so wish I had. The interviewee was an absolute baboon. Yeah, Epstein‚Äôs sick and demented actions are the result of male entitlement and definitely not about a depraved mind with millions of dollars at his disposal and governmental failures at every level. Sure. You lost me there, Wondery.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great doc, until the end

Very factual and to the point which is great...until the final episode.  Whoever wrote this believes he killed himself without even entertaining the mountain of evidence that this may not be the case. 

They also keep calling the island little St Jeff, not Little St James

Could have used a bit more time mentioning the island and how truly bizarre this relationships with the Clintons, Trump, and other powerful leaders and influencers world wide. 

Still good, but that last episode is definitely the worst of what is an excellent series.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you kidding me?

You feel ‚ÄòPresident Trump called Epstein ‚Äòa terrific guy‚Äô‚Äù so important in the entire Epstein story that you say it twice in the trailer?  Yeah, sure, Clinton being on Epstein‚Äôs plane 26x is not.  No thanks, Wondery.  Don‚Äôt need you to try to paint a narrative about this guy to protect the others involved.  The truth will prevail and who is on Epstein‚Äôs list is the REAL story that clearly you have no interest in telling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay...

Was well done, although this story is still fresh and more facts will come out. It could also go without all the fake Trump association... Everything Evil doesn‚Äôt have to end with ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDKH

Fascinating and well-researched podcasts about how Epstein made his fortune, gained the confidence of the upper wealthy, and how he coerced and trafficked his victims, and then glosses over the circumstances of his death rather breezily.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glad he‚Äôs dead

I wish he would of told more of who he did these terrible things with - sounds like he did to certain reporters. But I‚Äôm glad he can‚Äôt finish out his psychotic narcissistic sociopathic plan. Hope the victims get all his money eventually, that he made a deals with his grimy lawyers that no one worth anything gets to leave his money and gross properties. That women Maxwell hope she dies a horrible death as well, she‚Äôs no victim either. Disgusting that they are not charging her with anything. But unfortunately there will be no justice because in America no one cares about anything or anyone except money and have no morals. And these are the people that run our countries our states and run the most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù companies. Shame on everyone that knew him. If you went to his house or his parties, flown on his planes- you knew. Disgusting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Irresponsible interview

Your last interview with a journalist who knew Epstein was a terrible choice.
I couldn‚Äôt finish listening to a journalist who still seemed seduced and excited by his world and then suggested rape is about sex not power.
Sometimes, she said, someone just wants to finish even though they‚Äôve heard no and that‚Äôs about sex not power. 
You Did not challenge this!
This IS about power! I doubt they‚Äôd try this on a Champion boxer three times their size!
She spoke about the photo of Maxwell at a burger place in LA as if it were fact when there are many questions around its credibility, she misquoted Ambra‚Äôs recording of Harvey Weinstein and you didn‚Äôt challenge any of this.
Highly disappointed! Either you need to choose your talent more carefully or be willing to actually scrutinize what they are saying and not accept and promote this rubbish as fact. It is damaging!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mysterious Mr. Epstein

How was this allowed to happen?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mysterious Mr Epstein

There‚Äôs so much to the story of Jeffrey Epstein. Great reporting in this podcast. Money and power are 2 dangerous ingredients. It‚Äôs amazing how no one would listen to the many young female victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow

Disturbing to hear just how deep this rabbit hole goes. Such a great podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loved Most of it..

The interview in episode 8 with Vanessa whoever from Vanity Fair was super offensive. She compared Epstein to Matt Lauer?!?  She made it sound like people didn‚Äôt know?!?  Whatever some very prominent people new that the charges In Florida were bogus.  I do not like her take on this story. She seems to insinuate people are wrong in their perception of this atrocity. 
Jeffery Epstein was a sexual predator and he got away with it because of who he knew and how much money he had Period.  People knew he had issues they turned their head because he was white and rich and knew other white rich people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing!!

I try to share this podcast as much as possible. Where is Galaine Maxwell??? Thank you for investigating. Hopefully the victims will get vindicated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPSTEIN DIDN‚ÄôT KILL HIMSELF

EPSTEIN DIDN‚ÄôT KILL HIMSELF!!!!!

üò°ü§¨üò°ü§¨

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting and disturbing

I‚Äôve always known that rich, white a-holes and people with connections have privileges and the ability to get away with things the average person cannot. However, this story makes my stomach churn and my heart break for all the young girls (and boys) around the world that are abused and hurt by disgusting, sub-human pedophiles and the people that enable them. Praying to God Ghislaine Maxwell and others that haven‚Äôt ‚Äúcommitted suicide‚Äù yet pay for what they did and enabled. But most of all, prayers for all the girls and women who are survivors and fighting for justice!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 8

This Lindsay person is very hard to listen to. Hopefully she writes better than she talks. I could not finish the episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Couldn‚Äôt stop listening

Loved this podcast and couldn‚Äôt turn it off! Super informative, great narration, and presented Epstein from a lot of interesting angles. The only episode I didn‚Äôt like and didn‚Äôt finish was episode 8 featuring Vanessa. She came across almost in a way that defended him and the way she spoke about his actions described him as more eclectic than vile. He was abhorrent, not peculiar.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vocal fry warning

Great show, the better of the Epstein podcast out as of yet...but adjust your midrange audio settings because Vanessa‚Äôs vocal fry will make your ears and soul bleed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill him self

So informative. But disgusted with what he got away with! All involved need brought down!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast but

EPSTEIN DIDNT KILL HIMSELF

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Light on Facts

If you already know the basic facts of the Epstein case, you won‚Äôt learn much from this podcast. If you don‚Äôt know the facts, you‚Äôll get a much better (and quicker) introduction from the Miami Herald‚Äôs reporting on the issue. 

This podcast seems mainly intended to entertain people who enjoy crime dramas. That doesn‚Äôt usually bother me, but this case deserves more serious journalistic treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overproduced and leaves lots unexplored

They failed to mention Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs family ties to intelligence and silicon valley, didn‚Äôt mention Epstein‚Äôs use of Victorias Secret shows as recruitment venues, didn‚Äôt mention his ties to Attorney General Barr, did not mention that Alex Acosta claimed he was told to leave Epstein to the intelligence community, no mention of Epstein‚Äôs cellmate having a contraband phone confiscated when he was moved into the MCC, and so on and so forth. The island Little Saint James is repeatedly called ‚ÄúLittle Saint Jeff‚Äôs‚Äù, without clarification that this was a nickname. Laughably, at the end of the episode about his death, the host says the real ‚Äúmystery‚Äù of Epstein is how he managed to navigate high society without being caught. If there was one thing that is not a mystery, its that the rich and powerful turn a blind eye to the evils of their peers. Also, tasteless ads in the middle of the show that sometimes include Epstein‚Äôs name in the ad read! Nauseating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Half the story

I recently listened to the Mysterious Mr. Epstein podcast. I found it well done and very informative, until I got to the end. The last episode that explains how Epstein died did not even mention that there has been some suspicion as to whether he actually did in fact commit suicide or if he was murdered. The fact that it wasn‚Äôt mentioned at any point bothered me because as the story continues to unfold it appears more and more that he very well could have been murdered. 
Today it‚Äôs been reported that the two guards are being charged with conspiracy and filing false records. My conclusion to how I would access this podcast is it is half the story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill him self

Great podcast but Vanessa Grigoriadis speaks with a vocal fry that is absolutely annoying. She sounds like a stupid valley girl ... hard to tolerate ü§Ø

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting podcast but where is Julie K Brown?

Interesting podcast but ditch Vanessa G!  

Interview Julie K Brown the reporter from the Miami Herald who broke the case open.  I am sure she has a lot more to say since she interviewed more than 60 plus victims and got them to trust her and speak out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bravo for this Podcast

Words can‚Äôt express how I feel about this podcast, the stories and how it has come to life. This is excellent reporting and storytelling. And it‚Äôs not even over with. Justice to ALL victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will not say loved!

Very intriguing, disturbing, yet can cause me to ‚Äúbinge listen to this‚Äù.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So many commercials

Literally 6 minutes of the 40 minute episode were ads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Not sure why they don‚Äôt  have a WOMANS voice speak the role of the women!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great and informative

Another successful podcast for wondery. I am amazed by the information and the story is well done. Last episode is a zero for me though. I agree with the other comments about it. The lady, aside from her voice, seems irreverent towards the story of the women. Terms like Popped the cherry, bottom feeders, and chuckling while talking about victims, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall good listen

This was an educational and interesting podcast, but I had to cut it short because I couldn‚Äôt listen to Vanessa‚Äôs vocal fry and her saying ‚Äúlike‚Äù one more time. It was distracting from the content, which was disappointing.  Some people just aren‚Äôt meant for broadcast journalism, and she is one of them. I‚Äôll shy away from podcasts with her involvement in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love this

I love this podcast so much especially since I felt so uninformed going in. Vanessa‚Äôs interview upset me however, complaining about the topic of sex in media yet still talking about women‚Äôs sex lives in a weirdly sexist way. Also saying a media story ‚Äúpopped the cherry‚Äù for something, it‚Äôs just so regressive when you‚Äôre trying to combat how sex is perceived in media. It‚Äôs sad listening to a woman who doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs even -for women- in the first place.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanessa Grigoriadis is a snobby pseudo intellectual

I liked the podcast until episode 8 and that ruined it for me. I'm just an average woman, not a feminist by any means but I found her both sexist and classist. When she said Jeffery didn't only go for bottom feeders. So insensitive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informative and very interesting

Loved the entire podcast. Really appreciated the knowledge and different perspectives. Answered most of my questions I had about the case. Unfortunately, I simply had to turn off the last bonus episode. While it did seem like Vanessa had a great deal to add, her voice was just too distracting to retain the information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I liked the podcast but

in the last interview ...the subject‚Äôs voice is so 
fried..really really  irritating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast but please don't ever have the woman on episode 8 back!

This has been an incredibly eye opening podcast but dear God the woman in episode 8 has a horrible way of speaking! She's straight out of Valley Girls and her voice is so grating. I almost couldn't stand to continue to listen to the episode. Sounds very unprofessional. Otherwise, everything else has been fascinating and disturbing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 for Pod... except Vanessa

Overall a nice layout of events. Vanessa‚Äôs vocal fry and persona was intolerable, though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 stars

Jaw dropping , amazing storytelling

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jaw dropping

Unimaginable. Excellent story teller!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPERB

I enjoyed this podcast very much.
Exceptionally done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great series awful last episode

This was such a well done series.  It‚Äôs so tragic that he ended it interviewing some lifestyle reporter who sounds vacuous and adds nothing to the dialogue.  Worst ending since game of thrones.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 8

The worst episode, her voice is so annoying it seams she‚Äôs from the Kardashian‚Äôs family.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No bonus for me

I love the whole thing until we got to the bonus. She goes an octave higher at the end of each statement as the if it‚Äôs a question. It sounds like a fulfilled stereotype. I wish you hadn‚Äôt posted it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mysterious mr epstein

Fascinating

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOTTOM FEEDERS?!

So, I loved the show - I thought it was thoughtful and well researched; however, this is one of the few reviews I have ever written because your guest on Episode 8, Vanessa, does not have your tact or thoughtfulness. Besides being an apologists in many ways (and contradicting her own points), she referred to non-ivy league women and those without ‚Äúbig careers‚Äù as bottom feeders. An underage female, a woman from a low-resourced background, or a victim of sexual assault is NOT a bottom feeder. I am completely disgusted, shocked, and disappointed - was this guest vetted? Was there any discussion to leave this episode off? WHY?! I think there should be an episode 9 apologizing to listeners and victims of sexual violence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Podcast HATE Ep. 8

The guest on Episode 8 was extremely distasteful. From calling the perpetrator ‚ÄúJeffrey‚Äù repeatedly to continually stopping just short of blatantly justifying his behavior to using the appalling phrase ‚Äúpopping the cherry‚Äù when referencing college campus sexual assault...just all of it. I had to stop when Vanessa Grigoriadis began discussing her book because it‚Äôs the absolute last thing I wanted to hear more about - her views on anything, particularly consent. Not to mention the way every sentence ended as a question, her vapid affected voice. Garbage. Pure garbage.

Overall this podcast has struck the right tone on a consistent basis, and the only reason I can fathom that this episode is presented at all is to show the culture of NYC society and the media culture that permitted the perpetrator to operate unimpeded for years. This journalist had a front row seat, and it sounds like to me she enjoyed every moment of it. She made me nauseous and angry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listen!

Amazing! Thank you for an informative podcast!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing

Incredible content

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting.

Good podcast. I‚Äôm sure there is so much more. Funny how media tried  to mix Trump up in it and really it was Clinton‚Äôs name that kept coming up. Epstein was totally killed - the guy had a lot of big names he was about to drop. Sad for all those girls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skip Ep 8. Trust Me.

Really good podcast. Except skip ep 8. The guest has the worst up speak and way too many ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and ‚Äúright?‚Äù in every sentence. I could not ring myself to finish it. As a journalist I would expect her to know proper English. I would rather listen to a Kardashian sister.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I liked it

I think the podcast was great and informative. 
The Vanessa G. episode provided great perspective, but was hard to listen to (‚Äúlike, like, like‚Äù).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself

It was all good until the last episode when they said Epstein committed suicide. I didn‚Äôt listen to this podcast to hear about Epstein for all the stuff he had. I wanted a backstory on him and most of it be investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love your show BUT...

Episode 8 was a no for me as well. It‚Äôs all been said already, but she doesn‚Äôt sound professional at all....that accent is a put on too. She let up on it sometimes, other times it was SUPER thick. Stop already, Vanessa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

Another Wondery over-produced podcast that feels inauthentic. All hype and shine. If you are looking for an Epstein podcast there are better ones out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply the best podcast ->ever<-

All of the Wondery podcasts are awesome, but the mysterious mr Epstein is my favorite to date

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself

We all know Epstein didn‚Äôt kill him self.  This was a good podcast until they said he tied a sheet around his neck and killed him self.  It would be a much more interesting podcast if they investigated what actually happened to Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investigate and report the whole story

Why did you not investigate the powerful men riding on the plane and visiting the island? Are you afraid of them? There is no deep investigation or reporting on the men. This ‚Äúsex ring‚Äù will not stop until every man who participated are held accountable. 
Have women who were with these powerful men gone missing? Is the island also a grave yard? 
My heart breaks for the victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slow release

Decent podcast but you can‚Äôt release such short episodes once a week.

Updated: I can‚Äôt believe it ended without giving any interesting new details. Not up to Wondery‚Äôs high standard. Unless there is a season two, it was a waste of time.

Further update: all episodes are a complete joke. This podcast actually makes you dumber.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informative

Nice insight to the story of Jeffrey Epstein

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanessa From Vanity Fair Episode

Holy Cow SHE IS AWESOME! 
I mean wow this woman gave us A perspective we haven‚Äôt seen and did it with the kind of firecracker energy and insight i could listen to all day. 

She needs her own show!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit the frog

Great podcast until they allowed Kermit the Frog to narrate the last episode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly what I expected!

Great storytelling but no real substance that matters. They know they can‚Äôt hide the entire thing from you so they give enough to satisfy you. Did the hit mike reporter say Trump when talking about this? Nope. Clinton.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lindsay yes!

Love your voice. Love your work. Episode 8. Omg I can‚Äôt w her voice. Growl elsewhere. Sounds like a grown up valley girl. Nope. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëéüèªüôâ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very Informative

Host has an amazing voice and provides very insightful information. Episode 8 takes a turn. Vanessa Grigoriadis sounds inexperienced and entitled. Her voice is awful and, even though she is an ‚Äúexpert,‚Äù she sounds like she has NO professional authority on the topic. She sounds as if she‚Äôs more interested in name-dropping than providing insight on an important women‚Äôs issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learned more than I thought

In depth- the hosts delivery and reporting are excellent. Learned more about Epstein then I ever would have, elsewhere. Had to bail on the last bonus ep. with Vanessa Grigoriadis after she used a Nicki Minaj reference for no constructive reason.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Show is good

Just this last episode, #8, I can‚Äôt listen to her voice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many promos and samples of other shows

Can‚Äôt enjoy the story because they‚Äôre inserting so many other promotions for other wondery shows

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragnet

The host is great and delivers the show in a modernized 50‚Äôs Dragnet/Jack Webb style that is great counterpoint to the breathy ‚Äòjust live your truth‚Äô NPRish persona of many presenters in the Crime and Secret History sections of the podcast cloudscape and gift shop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A great series

Very informative. This podcast offers more in depth background information of Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gripping

One of the deepest dives into his monster, whether he killed himself or not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More Brilliance from Wondery and Lindsey Graham

This podcast is outstanding, and devastating. I followed the Epstein case closely, and I thought I knew everything about it - in fact I initially didn‚Äôt subscribe to The Mysterious Mr. Epstein, because I didn‚Äôt think there was more to know. But I was very, very wrong. It‚Äôs truly shocking how deep Epstein‚Äôs depravity was, how many people looked the other way, and the ugly details that the media glossed over. 

Everyone should listen to this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein DID NOT commit suicide!!

Jeffery Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself, He was killed to protect pedophiles in high & powerful places!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lol

The only in-depth parts are things you don‚Äôt care about. And there is ads every 5 minutes. Let down.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Great Overview

I really liked how they hit the highlights and dug deep where they had more information to give. I do feel that if there could have been more episodes we could have gotten a little more information, but Wondery is good about posting bonus episodes with pertinent info, so I‚Äôll be staying subscribed.

For those claiming this is politically biased, I don‚Äôt see it. Clinton is mentioned multiple times with the trips he took with Epstein and Trump is briefly mentioned only where it connects with the main story.
There is way more time spent with the businessmen Epstein was running with and his closest associates. No one was kept from scrutiny.

I think this was well produced and well reported. In a perfect world there would be less ads and more time spent digging deep, but there‚Äôs only so much a journalist can do, especially with such a button lipped case.
Hoping for more later!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What about Bill?

I love how this podcast constantly focuses on trump saying one thing about Epstein, but dusts over Bill Clinton‚Äôs 20 some flights on his airplane.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where‚Äôs a podcast telling TODAY‚ÄôS investigations?

Other than mention last week of Eptein‚Äôs brother hiring a specialist that‚Äôs publicily stated the autopsy results were NOT indicative of suicide, is there ANY PODCAST currently telling about investigations going on NOW?  All podcasts I‚Äôve heard talk all about the history. I want a source of what (if any) investigations are taking place now to bring accountability to the FL sheriff‚Äôs office, FBI and all those who blocked previous attempts to prosecute this monster.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was great

Very well done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not an ounce of questioning the govt narrative

Zero question of whether it was really a suicide. As if written by a middle schooler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must Listen, Riveting

Every American needs to listen to the podcast. It is so well done and you will zip through it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gist

This podcast did a good job at outlining the history of abuse, the formation of a character like J.E, and how incredulous the whole series of events are. I think the series did a good job of putting things into perspective and offering the facts, rather than opinion and conspiracy. I really appreciate that this series was made. It‚Äôs the perfect length; the simple, digestible, gist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Show

Really well done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had High Hopes

Boooo üëé 
The Trump references are just tooooo fake newsy. I mean, to be an ‚Äúinvestigative‚Äù look into this essential and timely epidemic... seems the 2 seconds required to eliminate skepticism re: Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúinvolvement‚Äù with the dirtbag WOULD‚ÄôVE been invested. 
Keep your eye on the ball Wondery (the public isn‚Äôt stupid ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inexcusably biased.

The media no longer reports the news, they construct it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HRCDJE

Excellent podcast for the most part, intriguing analysis of Epstein‚Äôs origin and rise to power, however the podcast completely ignores the fact that Jeffrey Epstein didn‚Äôt kill himself

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everybody needs to listen

This series highlights the way class and power always trumps justice. Money takes precedence over politics. More people need to hear about Epstein and his powerful friends of all political persuasions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good work

Brief episodes for the most part, but thorough in the presentation of the information. Good work on this podcast, and I‚Äôll be checking out other Wondery podcasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informative, horrifying, well-made

Very well put together to give you a perspective on all of E‚Äôs crimes and abuses. I just wish they were a bit clearer about their sources for some of the info

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many ads and not enough podcast.

I‚Äôm giving this 3 stars for two reasons. 

1. For such a short podcast with short episodes there felt like there was A LOT of advertisements. I was constantly having to stop and fast forward minutes into the podcast to get through the constant advertising. 

2. There could have been so much more information. I feel like I could have learned most of this from Wikipedia. Nothing was ever really dug deeply into and I feel like that made the podcast lacking to me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don‚Äôt let Epstein die in Silence

This podcast is so important on so many levels for solidifying the sinister story of a serial child sex trafficker, and notorious scammer, Jeffrey Epstein. For all the women who will never get closure through bringing Epstein to justice, giving this story to the world is so critical. Epstein and his friends and co-conspirators need to go down in history as the pigs they are, and NOT in silence. Thank you for this series.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very biased

I‚Äôve been wanting to learn more about this sick pervert, but the political slant on the podcast is hard to ignore. All they do is focus on his relationship to Trump (which ended over 15 years ago) and barely a word about Clinton who was on his flight logs and everything. I have no problems with them pointing out his relationship to Trump, but we‚Äôre going to ignore the painting of Clinton in Epstein‚Äôs home and not discuss their relationship at all?

Completed the series despite the bias. However, epsisode 7 was too painful to get through. A woman talking at length about taking down the patriarchy is too much liberal bias.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Start

This is a great start to the story of the disgust of Epstein. However, this is just the start, who will investigate the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of Epstein.....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mind blowing

Great podcast. The hosts voice fit this story telling perfectly. Every episode kept you wanting to hear more but knowing you would be horrified at what may come to light next.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good until episode 7

This was a really well done podcast up until episode 7. I‚Äôve enjoyed all of Lindsay Graham‚Äôs shows but have zero respect for Jim Clemente & Laura Richards. They are extremely biased and insist on being their personal political views into their commentaries and over shadow the victims they claim to advocate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not very comprehensive

It‚Äôs more like a brief of what happened to him and who he was. It wasn‚Äôt very comprehensive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Yes, Yes!

If this at all intrigues you, do not hesitate to press play! There are so many things that people do not know about this case.. Even though he‚Äôs gone, there are more like him, we should be attempting to educate ourselves through this. This was wonderful! I‚Äôm a social worker and I feel better having listened to this, so that when the time comes to connect the clues as to what‚Äôs happening and why, I know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing

Loved it and find it so crazy that this isn‚Äôt more mainstream news

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great to work out to, informative and slick.

Interesting and horrifying. The host‚Äôs voice is incredible and his voice reinactments are very convincing. Production is slick and flawless. This pod kept me engaged (AKA rage running) on my morning jog and helped me better understand the darkest parts of rich America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good

Really good, such a sick person

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great but

Glazed over the death... suicide? Let‚Äôs explore all options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public relations damage control

This podcast strangely doesn‚Äôt mention the strong connections Epstein had with Israeli intelligence and Israeli company Carbyne911, most notably his partnership with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. I feel like this podcast revealed information selectively and tried to persuade you that Epstein killed himself so you walk away thinking you are very well informed when key information has been withheld.  Is it damage control??  I feel like the writers of this podcast owe us much great investigation and discussion surrounding why the FBI didn‚Äôt react when this all first happened (who is responsible for this mishandling) as well as further digging around the convenient explanation as to why he was able to commit suicide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What??

Epstein clearly didn‚Äôt kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far too many ads

I‚Äôm never one to complain about advertising, as I understand they are necessary for podcasts to function on a financial basis. However, this show had far too many ads. Nearly a third of every episode was advertising and with episodes averaging 30 minutes, it barely gives you anything to listen to. If possible, I would recommend binging the six episodes because you get a lot more out of it. The content is good, but the extreme advertising really takes you out of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loved it!

After hearing so much about this case, I decided to learn more about it. What a disposable human being! I thought this was a well written podcast and I liked Lindsay Graham so much that I decided to look into his other podcasts!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Solid

This is a recap-style show based almost entirely on previous reporting, but it gets you up to speed on Epstein and his crimes in a succinct six episodes. Well-written. Does a good job pointing out many of the unanswered questions still out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

So well done... don‚Äôt miss out! Epstein and Maxwell are garbage. So are Clinton and Prince Andrew.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrible narration

I really, really wanted to like this podcast. The content is without question interesting, however the narrator is monotone to the extent I actually questioned whether it was computer generated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

This is the kind of podcast I generally like but I couldn‚Äôt get into it. I gave it a valiant effort, made it through about 4-1/2 episodes but I just lost interest. I can‚Äôt put my finger on exactly why, but they lost me at some point. The narrator was definitely a bit much, that‚Äôs for certain. He tried to make an already dramatic story more dramatic with his tone and it just felt stilted. I definitely got lost in the storyline (in a bad way). Perhaps it‚Äôs your cup of tea, it wasn‚Äôt mine.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good deep dive; way over the top tone

Interesting investigation of the JE story.  The voice narration and sound design are so over done it creeps me out.  Cheesy, sensational tv tone.  Accounts are specific and explicit enough to be their own form of entertainment for people with Epstein-like tendencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suicide?

Such a weak series with a pathetic end.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great pod

Anyone that finds fault with this podcast is crazy. It‚Äôs well written and presents Epstein as the slime ball that he was...not surprised trump hung with him.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Planet won‚Äôt miss him

Amazing how long he was able to dodge responsibility.  So much of this was new information, especially the background on how he obtained such wealth. Ms. Brown deserves a Pulitzer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent

What an excellent podcast. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would be of interest to me at first, but I learned so much that I didn‚Äôt know about Epstein. Definitely a must listen!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I expected better...

Honestly, the reporting is pretty pedestrian. The podcast certainty doesn‚Äôt seem to be the end-product of serious investigative reporting. Like many, I don‚Äôt believe that Jeffrey Epstein just killed himself. Evidently the reporter who wrote this does believe just that, although I couldn‚Äôt tell you why, because they conveniently left that out of the podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Propaganda masked as podcast

There is no way he committed suicide. I‚Äôm resigning off Wondery after this second attempt to rewrite history. The first being Malcolm Gladwell (revisionist history) trying to sell the notion Sandra Bland committed suicide while in Texas police custody. Her family was awarded a multi-million dollar settlement over Sandra‚Äôs wrongful death lawsuit. BS Propaganda, that‚Äôs al this is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Epstein podcast

Once again Wondery has done it! The best Epstein podcast out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never trust a man!

Jeffery sex-trafficked children. His fellow male friends indulged and reaped his financial rewards for their silence after his death. 

His assignation/suicide was a blessing. Hear all the sick details in this great podcast!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrible title

I understand that everyone is deathly afraid of the Clintons, but if you are going to make a podcast and bring up Trump‚Äôs connection to Epstein, which was tenuous at best, but brush over Bill Clinton‚Äôs trips on the Lolita express and his many visits to Epstein‚Äôs pedo island, that‚Äôs just dishonest. Come on, you can do better than that.

And did I mention the title of this podcast? This makes it sound like a children‚Äôs book, maybe ‚ÄúThe curiosity Shop.‚Äù This was an evil man, with other degenerates, who destroyed countless lives! Kinda gross.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Sick

I still wonder where he got all his money???  I ‚Äúget‚Äù that one might grow money (hopefully, in my case) with seed money.  Where did his originally jackpot come from?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alone in his cell

How in the world can you claim that Epstein killed himself? This one statement just discredited your entire work. I can‚Äôt believe this poor performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good until..

Have liked all of Wondery‚Äôs podcast.. except anyone with their head screwed on straight knows Epstein did not kill himself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lindsay Graham

I will listen to anything Lindsay Graham does. Always fascinating!  Keep up the great work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More commercials than content

Expect a bunch of sponsorship content!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sort of boring

There are some interesting new facts but it‚Äôs mostly a chance for the hosts to bore the audience with their commentary. 

It‚Äôs ok but not a great podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Riveting

As always, Lindsay Graham and his team tell and amazing story, this series was insightful and unbiased, letting the facts and research speak for themselves. But I‚Äôm writing this review to respond to the final lines of this six part series. Thank Wondery for not romanticizing or glorifying the character of Jeffery Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formulaic boredom

Great podcast for fans of NPR or PBS. Nothing new covered, boring assertions, apologetic for elitist trash, zero deep dives into intelligence links, rehashing of 5 month old information and a narrator that sounds like a boomer from Delaware. Complete waste of time, this podcast; it‚Äôs like riding a bike with training wheels and no seat upon the road to the establishment narrative. Boooo

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing new

This is not interesting. This is not journalism nor is it story telling.   The product sales and time between episodes this is Walmart podcasting.  Enjoy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent narration

I really appreciate Graham‚Äôs keen narration skills. Besides simply having a decent radio voice, he‚Äôs neither robotic nor sensational. Overall this makes a complex story easy to follow, with many intriguing twists and turns flowing along the way. This is one engrossing, grimy jaunt down the rabbit hole of wealth, power and corruption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh...

Is it a ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù that it wasn‚Äôt suicide or just a ‚Äútheory‚Äù?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well-Balanced and Chilling

The narrative is so well-crafted that it makes your blood boil to learn what he got away with. Also, don‚Äôt believe the Trump morons trying to rate this one star. The podcast spends plenty of time discussing how Epstein wormed his way into the Clinton‚Äôs inner circle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Money and criminal

It never amazes me that money lets you get away with such crimes.  It‚Äôs another R Kelly story. Our own government doesn‚Äôt protect us.  As a rape victim myself it brakes my heart that this continues. The end of episode 6 the narrator says we will never know how Jeffrey Epstein got away with this, I beg to differ.  We know exactly how he got away with it the ‚Äúclub‚Äù of rich white men!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, but padded out

Great podcast, but it feels a little padded out. They probably could have cut this down to 3 solid episodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puff piece

This sounds like Jeff was a good guy with a small problem. Notice the last batch of wondery podcast are supportive of the criminals in their stories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast - bad title

Good podcast but I don‚Äôt like the title. It is too kind. It should be The Child Rapist Epstein or When Horrible People Get Power and Money.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing New, Nothing To See Here

The idea that the man killed himself is insane. Too many cameras turned off, too many guards a sleep, and even the medical report shows that he was strangled. I really think you need to evaluate the new information that is just now coming to light. This podcast feels like a money grab and a back door to insult Trump while ignoring the crimes by Bill Clinton.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great work ... sick dude.

Thanks.  Everyone should listen to this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infuriatingly intriguing.

Nice to hear the back story and details of this monster. So glad he and his cohorts have been outed here in such a way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you

Thank you for keeping this story alive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To vague

The episodes are short and filled with way to many ads. Nothing here is new and has already been told. It‚Äôs also disgusting that a sponsor is Ashley Madison. This is not investigative journalism, but telling his story from the web. Nothing to help the victims, nothing to bring justice and nothing to bring him further down or his helpers. Could have done better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extraordinary podcast ‚Äî well researched and presented

This exploration of a man of boundless evil ably shows how relentlessly and cruelly he hurt young women and girls whom he and his associates lured. The mysteries of how he got away with the crimes, why powerful men associated with him under circumstances which must have revealed at least some of his sickening criminality, and so much more, are explored in a fashion that makes the podcast an addictive listen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good series, 'til the end...

The narrative that Jeffrey Epstein "killed himself" is just piss poor reporting/story-telling. The whole series was in vain if you're to have the listener believe for a moment that it's a conspiracy that this billionaire just happened to off himself. 1 star.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My God this man talks to fast

So far it‚Äôs very interesting. I understand why there is so many ads. I listen to these podcast while trying to work in a factory and it‚Äôs never been a problem for me but for heaven‚Äôs sake this guy talks so fast I feel like I‚Äôm missing a lot of what he is saying and I don‚Äôt have time to go back and listen again. Maybe it‚Äôs just me....who knows?!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing new if you‚Äôve followed the news

I hoped that this podcast would provide new information, but it was more like a 6-part review of the major news stories surrounding Epstein. I kept listening, hoping that the next episode would be the one that blew this thing open, but I was left feeling pretty disappointed at the end of the 6th episode. Bummer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informative, appalling, and frightening

Thankful for this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you

For reporting on this crucial story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing! Must watch!

This is must watch podcast! I don‚Äôt want to give anything away. But this is worth every single minute. Great work team!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great!

Another great podcast from wondery!!! I‚Äôm ready for the next one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good show but the advertisements are in bad taste

Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate to interrupt a story about sexual abuse and trafficking to advertise hair dye and bed sheets!! Anyone else? Just leaves me with an icky feeling. This is not the podcast for that and quite tone deaf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice.

It was a good listen but Jeffery Epstein didn‚Äôt commit suicide. He was obviously taken out by the powerful people who were on his numerous lists and records. He was a sick man and was murdered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fascinating

Great to hear directly from JKB, the journalist who worked so hard to unmask Epstein and his evil ways.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast, too many ads

I have really enjoyed this podcast, but there are way too many ads. I obviously skip through them, but it‚Äôs very frustrating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Storytelling But Ads Galore

Wondery makes some fantastic podcast series. The storytelling is great, they use a lot of interviews, and they are interesting to listen to. My one knock on them is that they are filled with ads. I get it, they need to get paid so that the podcasts can continue to be free but be prepared to try and be sold all sorts of products or services. Everything else about this podcast is great!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confusing plodding narration

Because 95% of this podcast AND the embedded ads feature the same narrator, what might be a fascinating story quickly becomes a real drag. However, this narrator's endless droning becomes a read barrier to excellence. Please consider incorporating other voice talent, at least for the ads. The same voice should also not be used to dramatize both sides of a conversation. Thanks!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor title choice.

I‚Äôm mostly in agreement with all other reviews - too many ads, mostly information you already know. However, the name ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù in the title is a gross understatement and downplays the horrific trauma he caused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Liberals made and produced this podcast

I was very interested in the corruption of the partisan democrat Epstein. Unfortunately, almost from the very beginning, President Trump is erroneously tied to Acosta and supposed ‚Äúcontroversial appointments.‚Äù Shame on you liberals for this phony production. I won‚Äôt listen to a second more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only surface info already known

This was entertaining despite the incessant interruptions of lengthy and annoying advertisements.    But there‚Äôs nothing new here.  Just dramatic retelling of known facts.     What was missing is WHY the police and prosecutors ignored the women‚Äôs assertions.     Why were so many influential men willing to look the other way when witnessing his obvious exploitation of young women.    Also mo info on what Acosta is currently doing.    

All in all no insight.  No new info.   Rehash with drama but no analysis     

I will not be listening to the many other hyped popcasts.   No tolerance for the endless ads.      Save your time.  Find better podcasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too Many Commercials!!!

Almost as much time spent on Commercials as the story.  I got so tired of the Commercials that I didn‚Äôt even finish the story.  There are also better stories about Epstein out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well Done Wonery

A great take on the Epstein chronicles! Easy to listen to except for the sex trafficking üò¨

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Superficial and

Broken: Jeffrey Epstein is far superior. A google search provides the same information as this podcast, with less ads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great insight into the mind of a sociopath

The life of Jeffrey Epstein offers a terrifying view into the world of the mega wealthy and what they think and do to the rest of us. This is extremely important information to have, take the time to listen to this podcast!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many ads

Why are there so many ads... barely any of the actual podcast to listen to. Also why are the female victims statements read by a male.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall not impressed

- Way too many ads. I get they‚Äôre providing this for free and need to make money but it‚Äôs excessive 
- None of the information seems original, it‚Äôs all a repeat of what is on the news. There are no real deep dives into the information. 
- Too much focus on Trump, I want to know about the other celebrities and politicians that are involved. 
- Episode release is sporadic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
worse than hulu commercials

wondery is SURE tryna make their money... nothing wrong with it but three ads in a row every 5 minutes in a 25 minute podcast is obnoxious. it ruins the flow of the podcast. OTHERWISE awesome information, a really well put together audio drama... however, i can‚Äôt focus on nearly anything. sad because this is thrilling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How bout Obama‚Äôs connection?

The connection of Clinton and Obama is far more damning than Trumps! Shame on the constant hypocrisy!! I expected better from you...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFO 2

Very interesting, JE TOTAL PREDATORY PSCHO who used his substantial intelligence to take advantage of everyone he touched.  I have one question that requires clarification if possible.  I agree that the age of consent in Florida SHOULD BE 18 as stated in the podcast however- I believe the age for a person to consent in Florida is 16 not 18 years old at least among teenagers and young adults.  If that‚Äôs the case it should be changed to 18.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disturbing and informative

This podcast was put together very well, really enjoyed listening!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Incredible

I don‚Äôt have words to describe this podcast but here we go. It‚Äôs jaw dropping, horrifying, thought provoking, well written, very easy to listen and beyond enjoyable. Well done!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

It‚Äôs an ok podcast but I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre telling us anything that we don‚Äôt already know. It‚Äôs a 30 minute podcast but they only spend about 18 minutes talking about the subject. The rest of the time is spent with commercials and promo‚Äôs for other podcasts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SO WHO KILLED THE MONSTER?

Excellent reporting. Clearly Jeffrey Epstein was a narcissistic sociopath. At no point was he able to discern that he had done anything wrong. I don‚Äôt believe he would have had reason to believe he was going to be held accountable for his behavior, therefore it doesn‚Äôt stand to reason he would have the insight to believe anything was going to change for him. This, along with the mysterious facts of his ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù leads me to the conclusion that someone powerful who was also at risk of detection for any number of serious crimes made sure that he would never talk. But WHO?
So many men ( and sadly women) might have been involved. How far did it all go? To the top?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking and addicting

Can‚Äôt. Stop. Listening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrifying!

The detail and research is incredible. I thought I knew the whole story. I was so wrong. Thank you for bringing this information to the public notice. 
That is the only way to help stop it from happening again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too Short

Good podcast, but the episodes are way too short. It‚Äôs like as soon as I start to get into the episode, it‚Äôs over.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
great story!

great reporting. the story is very enjoyable to listen to whether you think you know the details or not. my only complaint is the wait time between the short episodes. lucky be the listener who waits and binges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great...but lots of commercials!

Great story line and speaker! Hooked me in to the story right away. Only wish there wasn‚Äôt so many commercials, I feel like they take up most of the episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads and not enough

Very well written but too many commercial breaks and the episodes are super short!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heard it all before

Nothing new here.  If you want to here old news stories rephrased with music in the background and a ton of ads this may be the podcast for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chilling

This pod cast is not for everyone and specially survivors of sexual assault. It is scary and chilling...it exposes the many ways that money and power are often a get out jail card and justice is at time never served. It also shows the need for real journalism in any civilized society by exposing the truth good. Journalists and the survivors are the real heroes of this story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast,  full of ads

It‚Äôs a good podcast but it‚Äôs 45 minute episodes with 12 minutes of ads

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done

Just how convenient that he died. I wonder if it was assisted suicide?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loved it!!

Full of great detailed information. The news on tv can be repetitive, political and strays from the actual facts but this keeps its focus. It moves quickly and I couldn‚Äôt stop listening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting.  But skip the dramatization.

It is an interesting topic and Graham is a good presenter, but, like the story of Elliott Spitzer, he undercuts the presentation with cheesy dramatizations of discussions and events.  The facts alone are interesting, so let them speak for themselves.  Just tell us what was said; that is enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

Too many commercials not enough story per episode. But otherwise a good listen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Show

It‚Äôs a well done podcast, but there are commercials that seem to happen every five minute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done.

Thank you for this podcast. I thought it was going to be a case of Epstein again headlined. President Clinton, Prince Andrew, et al linked to case. Epstein dies under questionable circumstances. End of story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent

What a great podcast ! The storytelling is excellent as they unravel Epstein‚Äôs crimes! Wow!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbelievable

Epstein is a complete disgrace to the human race.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mind = blown

Like another review said - they can‚Äôt come out with the newest episodes soon enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it scratching the surface?

Great podcast but I have a feeling the rabbit hole is a lot deeper than this series goes.

The most chilling part when they offered their 17 year old toy $200k a month and a house to have a baby for them. You know that goes on. How sick and sad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Podcast!

Very informative...and the host, Mr. Graham, makes it very interesting.  SO much information!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another amazing Wondery podcast

This is another amazing Wondery production. Host is great, information presented well, infuriating content but handled with care.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A safe regurgitation of news articles

I was really hoping this podcast was going to discuss all the information that is well-known and documented but is not being discussed by mainstream media. It doesn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs nothing new here; it‚Äôs just the same info that was in the longer-form news articles that came out months and years ago. The True Anon podcast goes much, much deeper if listeners can get beyond the cohost‚Äôs crass humor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent!!

I typically love all podcasts that Wondery publishes, so I figured I‚Äôd give this one a try. I was hesitant because this was not a subject I was very interested in (felt I‚Äôd seen and heard enough about it already in the news, etc.). What else could Wondery really add?  Glad I took a chance! Very interesting, informative and intelligently written. Also, I love this particular host (Lindsay Graham) and I will listen to probably anything he hosts (he even makes the ads sound good).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great

They can‚Äôt release them fast enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So different

So different from the other podcasts on JE...and far more interesting. Very insightful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menacing narrator adds to creepiness but why?

Hearing this raspy baritone man narrate these episodes would be okay for Fiction, I suppose.

But since this piece describes horrifying acts of sexual violence perpetrated on children, girls, young women....it‚Äôs utterly wrong casting. Especially when the narrator quotes the girls. His rough man-voice reading a girl‚Äôs diary entries is soul-crushing. 

This style of dramatization is disrespectful to this monster‚Äôs myriad victims. Why in the world wouldn‚Äôt you cast a female voice-over artist? It would support the voiceless victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent, leaves me wanting more

I‚Äôd give it 5 stars, but I end each episode feeling unsatisfied wanting more details. More in-depth details about the players involved. Episodes could be longer with more elaboration. It‚Äôs like being served filet mignon, but only getting to savor the first bite. Also, the music at the end of the podcast is jolting after 30 minutes of peaceful and pleasant narration.  The song does not belong in this space.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding. But Prince Andrew is NOT ‚Äúfourth in line of the throne‚Äù

Outstanding series. Bravo, and the strength of the young women coming forward is just amazing. 

However I had to correct that statement that Prince Andrew is ‚Äúfourth in line to the throne‚Äù ‚Äî totally wrong and fixable by one Wikipedia check. The line goes from Prince Charles to Prince William to all of William‚Äôs children regardless of gender (adorable children all), and then to Prince Harry, and then his children, as Prince Charles‚Äôs second child. All of these are *before* Andrew as the line always goes through the first son, and all of his heirs, regardless of gender in the modern age. Andrew is way back at 8th and falling as Harry and the Duchess have more children. 

Thank god ‚Äî Andrew is just one of the disgusting creeps in this appalling tale.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

Fascinating!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One of my favorites

Great podcast that handles a touchy subject in a tasteful way.
Mind boggling but incredibly informative on what money truly can buy you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mixed

The reporting is clear, concise, and seemingly unbiased. However, the title shows deference to Epstein. He‚Äôs not mysterious. He‚Äôs absolutely abominable. He is NOT deserving of the title Mr. He is a despicable human being.  I‚Äôm surprised this was not given a more fitting, factual, and journalistic title. Here‚Äôs hoping this podcast doesn‚Äôt take a turn towards the title and show affinity for Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not up to usual wondery quality

The episodes are very short and loaded with commercials, making it hard to follow the story. The material is interesting but very hard to follow because it's so broken up. I'd rather have longer episodes but less of them, it would make the story more cohesive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outstanding

This has been on of the best and details podcast I‚Äôve heard. Outstanding on all fronts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

Epstein is in witness protection telling on everybody. My opinion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast

Very interesting.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can‚Äôt even

**Some spoilers**
Narrator and story structure is great, I just can‚Äôt even with this Epstein guy. I got through a few and couldn‚Äôt continue. I listen to a lot of true crime with grisly details, but I can‚Äôt handle 5 minutes of this slime bucket. To live in a world where a girl (Yes, girl...under 18) can be groped/raped by Epstein and his lackeys, and then is told by 9-1-1 that Wexler owns the Sheriffs Office, and an officer is on scene when he‚Äôs not, is deeply unsettling and wrong on so many levels. For same girl to be blamed for the attack, ignored by the FBI, and told she cannot leave the property, just wow. I‚Äôm glad this pile of üí© is no longer around to hurt other innocent children.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ruined it w bias

Why is it not mentioned that clinton was on epstein‚Äôs plane? Why is it that you don‚Äôt mention Trump kicked him out of his club? i won‚Äôt even finish because it seems like you aren‚Äôt telling the whole story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Praying On The Innocent

Great presentation very factual, referencing other postings Trump and President Clinton are the furthest thoughts from my mind as I listen to perpetuators closest to Epstein that allowed his ungodly actions to become a normal occurrence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gripping & Uncomfortably Recent

Lindsay Graham is brilliant as always in his narrative, and this is a story well worth listening to. Very rarely do I wait week by week for a podcast series to release the next episode, but I am absolutely hooked here. Wondery has done a thorough job of illustrating the many players involved in a scandal of this magnitude, and has truly shown the disturbing lengths the top 1% will go to cover their own tracks (as well as their cohorts.)

I am saddened and increasingly less shocked by the discoveries being made here, as they‚Äôre highly reflective of the events taking place today. My heart goes out to every brave woman who‚Äôs shared her story here- and to those whose experiences cannot be so openly shared. 

Keep up the great reporting and hopefully this brings some negative attention to those who‚Äôve yet to suffer any consequences!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another great podcast by Lindsey Graham!

This podcast is an excellent addition to the Jeffrey Epstein story. Graham‚Äôs podcast tells a clear compelling story about a vicious predator who hid in clear sight! Credit is given to Julie Brown and her intrepid publisher at the Miami Herald who had the courage to out this wicked predator! Thanks Lindsey Graham and Wondery!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ah! Such a scandal

It has been fascinating to hear how this jerk made his money and gained his power.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good listen but...

How about you stop trying to tie Trump to this loser.  President Trump banned him from Mar a Lago and hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in over 15 years. DON‚ÄôT GET IT TWISTED!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biased much ?

I find it funny how the podcast (in the first 5 minutes) mentions how Trump called Epstein ‚Äúa nice  guy‚Äù a couple times but fails to mention Bill Clinton‚Äôs dozens of trips on Epstein‚Äôs plane . Just brushes even the fact he new Clinton another rapist .

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely enthralling

The podcast has made me so eager to hear more about Jeffrey Epstein and his crimes. I enjoy the thoroughness of the podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üòÆ

I had no idea. Can‚Äôt wait to hear the rest of it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need more!!

Where are episodes 4-6???  I want to hear the rest of the story. I‚Äôm hooked!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horrible title!

Calling Epstein ‚ÄúMysterious‚Äù makes it seem like he‚Äôs a regular guy who is a riddle to be solved. This should be called the Horrifying Truths about Mr. Epstein. Mysterious has a positive connotation and has no business being attached to this monster. Hence the two stars. 

That said it‚Äôs well done, has great support and resources for victims and a fascinating story. I just wish you‚Äôd worked harder to come up with an appropriate title.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addictive but enraging.

Simply that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Topical

There are two podcasts out at the moment about Jeffrey Epstein. This one is the better produced of the two. If I had one criticism it would be the intro and outro song. It‚Äôs awful and doesn‚Äôt fit the feel of the podcast subject at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bias

Something tells me by the way this starts that they will paint Trump as involved and completely skip over Bill Clinton.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lindsay Graham is an amazing story teller

This podcast is so well done, scary there are such predators out there and how Epstein got away with it by throwing his money around.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great!

It doesn‚Äôt matter about reviews regarding the podcast. Trump, commercials or what ever People will say. Still great- great podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOL @ Trailer Trash

Great podcast!
It‚Äôs unfortunate that some subscribers care less about the horrific crimes perpetrated by a powerful man, his friends and the failure to give them any justice, bc of their admiration for another lifelong sexual predator who in fact was accused along with JE in 2003. Dropped right before the election bc of death threats. Hmmm sounds familiar. Idc what a persons politics are, if you‚Äôre a pedo you deserve to rot. It‚Äôs ppl who chose to pick & chose what‚Äôs convenient or easier for them that allow things like this to last so long. Many many people knew & took part or did nothing. That‚Äôs what makes this story so mind blowing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grossly addicting

This man was an absolute monster and I can‚Äôt stop listening. üò≥

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So good! I‚Äôm totally addicted!

This is a fabulous! Where is episode 4?! Im hooked and need the rest!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ads

This podcast is so interesting but the way he transitions into ads is actually the worst

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

Very well done but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard so many commercials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediately hooked

I started this podcast yesterday and have already gone through the first three episodes. I am hooked! I hope this podcast shows you what money and power can buy you and atrocious our legal system really is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change the Title

Why give this criminal the respect of using ‚ÄúMR.‚Äù Epstein? Have no respect for this man

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addicting podcast

This podcast is so addicting!  The content is so crazy, I can't wait to hear more!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very informative!

I have learned so much regarding Jeffrey Epstein and what actually happened.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good, great pace and info

Great podcast! The pacing is great, not drawn out. Great info , deep but easy to follow because of the story and it‚Äôs narrator. Highly recommend especially if you do not know anything except for the basic ‚Äúnews story‚Äù. Great job so far!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great job!

As usual, Lindsey Graham does a fantastic job. I love any thing he is associated with. Love the format of interviews, audio drama, at Cetera. Gives a more detailed perspective on this vile, vile man.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fascinating  . . .

. . .  how this rich NYC clan evidently has immunity from many, if not most,  laws. 
However by Ep. 3, Jeffrey Epstein is similar to the Shrink Next Door. And  Les Wexner is similar to Martin Markowitz, the victim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love it!!

I never write reviews but this podcast is so addicting!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Should be called the Rapist Jeffrey

The name of this podcast should not referred to him as a Mr. as he was a horrible human being who preyed on young girls and rape them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great!

Really reeling me in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How high does it go

I hope we get some insight about how high this goes, who‚Äôs involved and what they are doing to uncover this all . He did not commit suicide , no one believes thAt and it needs to see the light of day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ridiculous

These comments are filled with crazy conspiracy theorists about Pizzagate or some garbage. Here‚Äôs the truth, Bill Clinton AND Donald Trump we‚Äôre involved with this creep. As were many, MANY other people, including Prince Andrew. These overwealthed (mostly) men act as though they are gods. They are disgusting, yet their wealth and influence gets them a free pass for life. We should find them all, prosecute them, and take all their money and divvy it up to everyone else. 

As for this podcast, Broken is better. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not getting the attention this one is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State vs Fed

Only listened to episode 1 so far.  I listen to podcasts strictly for entertainment and I love true crime podcasts.  I always pay particular attention to detail and try to look into things that don‚Äôt connect or don‚Äôt make sense.  In episode 1 it clearly mentions the lead investigators were the PBPD who handed over evidence to the PB State Attorney (the prosecutor) who had no interest in pursuing a criminal case despite the overwhelming evidence.  It was only after that the the PBPD Chief with to the US Attorney.  Why aren‚Äôt the details of the State Attorney‚Äôs actions discussed in detail?  To me and anyone who really wants to get to the bottom of it, that investigation has to be included.  Who was the SA and why was he/she so lenient?  The PBPD Chief surely opened up about that aspect as well if he opened up about the Fed prosecutorial process.  Politics aside, both the state and fed prosecutors failed the victims.  I just can‚Äôt wrap my mind around why the SA‚Äôs actions were not discussed in great detail.  Am I missing something??  Three stars because title is terrible (-1) and details about SA left out (-1).  Very interesting topics however.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lame af

2 suburban white kids giving their perspectives on the city where they're not from and their privileged experiences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really Good podcast!!

Great job so far, i am learning a lot of details I have not yet heard about.  Cannot wait for the rest of the episodes!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No more Wondery for me!

How can we believe anything you produce from here on out if you don‚Äôt actually investigate the REAL facts and put out the truth. He‚Äôs was heavily tied in with the clintons and the Clinton foundation, was trafficking children to elites while capturing dirt on them he could use politically to gain power. This podcast is a disgrace and propaganda journalism at its best because of what you dont say mainly and where you tried to point the finger. I hope you‚Äôre able to brainwash some ignorant sheep with it but now I question the facts and honesty of the journalism in every podcast I‚Äôve listened to Wondery has put out. It‚Äôs a shame honesty is no longer part of journalism today and propaganda and deception have taken over.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good except ....

Except for the whimsical podcast title.  ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Mr. Epstein‚Äù ??? Sounds like a children‚Äôs book title or something.
Edited to say - I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has serious side eye about the title for this podcast. I hope everyone involved reconsiders naming it something more appropriate...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Was that it??????

2 episodes???  Lazy production...I‚Äôm over it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lol @ all the snowflakes

Really great podcast. Mildly hilarious that there are so many haters solely because they mention trump and Acosta. If they listened to the podcast they would realize the context.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impressive

This podcast seems to be custom made for me.  I don‚Äôt believe how out of touch I am with the latest technology.  I‚Äôm a huge fan of true crime stories and forensic shows! I have hit the jackpot with the Morbid: A True Crime Podcast. The Mysterious Mr. Epstein has me hooked from the opening sentence! I‚Äôm sure I will never be disappointed!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast...but the TITLE??? Come on.

I expect more from Wondery.  This is a good podcast but the title...come on guys.  This should more along the lines of MONSTROUS world of Epstein....even calling him Mr. gives him too much courtesy.  Pls rethink this one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trump‚Äôs name is mentioned because

Trump‚Äôs name is mentioned because Epstein was jailed in Manhattan during Trump‚Äôs administration, Acosta resignation under Trump, and Epstein suicide happened in 2019. Clinton was mentioned but OBVIOUSLY this hit the news big time in 2019. The trumpanze folks need to wake up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title is sketch af

What in the world is up with this title? I am so annoyed with and disappointed in Wondery for this that I can‚Äôt listen to it. Makes my skin crawl. Straight to the trash bin with this one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad title! Change it.

Informative although not new if you follow & read Julie K. Brown‚Äôs outstanding work. 

Just want to emphasize how horrible this title is (like others who‚Äôve posted). Please change it!! Epstein is a creep, a disgraced sex offender. Don‚Äôt use ‚ÄúMister‚Äù. He doesn‚Äôt deserve it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Press is the Hero

Well done. Especially interested that Dershowitz and Epstein‚Äôs legal team avoided trial by pulling strings. Lots of heads should roll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People still support trump :(

So many reviews were angry about shots at Trump... it‚Äôs unbelievable to me that people still can have this stance and is their takeaway from this story. Go read a book knuckledraggers...please

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I‚Äôm listening...

but what the hell is with this title.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast, awful reviews

Love that any negative review is either oddly focused on defending Trump or shallowly commenting on the title. The podcast has excellent pacing, and information is well-corroborated. The ads do get a bit much, but that‚Äôs how podcasts make money; it‚Äôs really not too much effort just to press the skip button. Definitely give this a listen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The war within a war

This podcast talks about corruption at the highest level and yet fails to mention the facts the direct ties to Bill Clinton and other public figures. And throws around trumps name many times as if he was connected to this monster. Censorship at it‚Äôs best

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excuse me

The title alone is a no for me

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting

Democratically will absolutely love this podcast. They smell like roses. No mention of Epstein/Clinton Foundation ties or how President Trump had Epstein removed from Maralago after realizing that Epstein was a pervert. No mention of how President Trump went to authorities in Florida to report Epstein. Also only brief mention of Bill Clinton having known Epstein and nothing about the over 25 trips Bill took on Epstein jet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fake Podcast

A number of negative refernces to Trump and the Trump Administratioon and nothing about countless trips by Bubba on the Lolita Express.  A lot of effort must have gone into this Podcast,  why not tell the story with accuracy and not be a lap dog for a particular political party.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fake News

Predictable liberal reporting throwing Trumps name out at ever chance possible. Only mention Clinton once even though he was one of the Clintons biggest financial supporters and he and Bill hung out socially all the time. He had a painting of Bill Clinton wearing a dress in the foyer of his apartment for Pete‚Äôs sake! Unfortunate no one can have true unbiased reporting any longer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A whole new spin on Epstein

Amazed that certain individuals didn‚Äôt have the power to block this podcast, but glad they didn‚Äôt!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many commercials

Good content and production but the amount of ads is ridiculous.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
another one?

How many podcast do you need on this pile of spent garbage???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast!

I appreciate the work and research that‚Äôs put into this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Stuff

I love Lindsey Graham! It tells these stories so well! Lots of unknown and behind the scenes and dark corners things touched on in this series. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with LG‚Äôs performance and narration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great storytelling

I really like how Lindsay Graham delivers a story. It‚Äôs always captivating and edge-of-your-seat stuff. Consistently great!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good content, offensive title

Title needs work though. It‚Äôs not ‚Äòmysterious‚Äô to be a powerful man who molests young girls and finds ways to hide it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predictable

Unreal how the podcast starts with the Trump connection. In reading the other reviews appears that it‚Äôs going to continue. I can‚Äôt listen any longer. So biased as expected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great show

Jesus Christ what a horrid abuse of power and justice . This is going on everywhere I‚Äôm sure I hope people get called out more and more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make it fair make it true

Please give all truths to this very interesting, sad story. I don‚Äôt want your political slants. I want all the truth or why make a podcast? Your listeners are not stupid so please don‚Äôt treat us as such.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accomplice

Will there be civil suits against Former Labor Secretary Acosta? How can all the women‚Äôs pain be swept under the rug? I love the podcast and can‚Äôt wait for the outcome!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download issues

I was able to listen to the preview but the others won‚Äôt download. Any suggestions?!?!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many ads

Great podcast but way too many ads. More than American Scandal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So good!

Big fan of Lindsay Graham!  Really like what Wondery has done here.  This show reveals so many unknown details in such a creative way all while bringing awareness around a deeply serious and scary topic.  Will def keep listening!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One slight but expected flaw

It‚Äôs not surprising that one president‚Äôs name was inserted and his voice played as often as possible to associate him with this case while former President Clinton, who molested an intern and who was ENTERTAINED by Epstein,  was mentioned maybe twice so far (-3 stars). The media is quite predictable these days. Anyway, other than that it‚Äôs a 5 star podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love it

Well done podcasts. Can‚Äôt wait to here the other 4 episodes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great info!

Listening to this podcast, you can really tell the makers did their research! This provides the kind of background that I‚Äôve been missing in news stories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giving this a chance

Seems pretty cool, first episodes blew my mind. Crazy story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So happy to find this

Thank you for putting this out there WHILE we are in the midst of it rather than years later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done

I can always count on Wondery for engaging storytelling. This is a fascinating and infuriating story. Thank you for telling it so well!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep dive

Oh man. Been waiting for someone to make an in-depth podcast in this creep. Glad Wondery got there first! Subscribed in an instant!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sounds interesting.

Wondery makes good stuff. Very interested to hear their take on this story.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
