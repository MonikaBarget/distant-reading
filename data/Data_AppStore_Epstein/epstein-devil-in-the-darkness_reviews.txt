Great podcast series

Great podcast series. Please do a few updates with the latest information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Must listen

This is riveting stuff which is superbly produced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not solve anything

Last episode they claim to solve the mystery about how he died but complete lie. Pretty good series overall but ruined by the click bait type of approach from the podcasters

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeah nah

Over sensationalised over dramatised. Lots of good interviews and information I‚Äôm just not into the whole shock value delivery

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent... when is the next drop?

This podcast is excellent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

It‚Äôs hard to find a good podcast worth listening too, this one is great really enjoying each episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kel smith

Love your work!!!! great way to start the day

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMAZING!!

Incredible story, cannot recommend enough!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

What a conman. What a lurking shadow.  What a rock spider. What a story!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like this but Dylan Howard is the EP

This sounds great and is very entertaining. They have some good interviews in episode one. I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight but I‚Äôm going to have to do some soul searching about whether I should listen to any more of this. Dylan Howard aka mate of Harvey Weinstein is the EP. How strange. At least they are upfront about it. Not sure I can keep listening without feeling a bit yuck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad audio

Seems very promising but horrible audio on one of the phone interview. I would rather not have that interview than have such a bad quality

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent podcast

Very well done podcast!  Professional, easy to listen to.  I binged it over a few days ‚Ä¶ was not enough!  Thank you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Factorius

Go fuctorius your self

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interruptions

Content seemed good but WAY too many advertisements. I didn‚Äôt listen to all of them because of that. I like to listen to podcasts in bed and I don‚Äôt want to have to keep pausing to skip through ads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bizarre limited hangout

An American podcast that seems to be more interested in the Epstein and prince Andrew connection as a cover rather than his connection with les wexner,clintons ,bill gates,pinker etc and in a twist uses one of the accuser dershowitz as a contributor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well done

Best podcast on Epstein

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No skin off my back. I AM CANADIAN!

But seriously even the comments on here sound like bratty children who either are on the red team or the blue team.  Even when it‚Äôs about this POS you guys are making it about politics.  Sheesh give it. Rest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why are you talking so fast?!

Although I‚Äôm enjoying the podcast and the content, I can‚Äôt ignore that everyone seems to be speaking very fast! Almost like fast forward as some parts...it‚Äôs very distracting

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fake news!!

Jeffrey was innocent.. he was set up by the queen.. fake news!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awesome

Couldn‚Äôt wait for the next episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Masterfully crafted.

Easy listening, logical sequencing and a vast variety of interview sources. Compelling storytelling, but terrifying to discover the facts and extent of corruption. I‚Äôm addicted to this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devil alright!

Gives you a total picture of who this freak was.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misinfo??

Seriously the KGB?? No mention of the Mossad? Where is this coming from. Sounds like it‚Äôs written by Christopher Steele.  Don‚Äôt waste your time, fake news.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can she talk any faster?

Danielle speaks far too quickly.  It ruins the podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Superb. Engaging. Shocking.

Beautifully presented. Extremely professional and well researched. Wholly recommend this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adverts üò≠

Clever podcast, good investigators and interviews, so annoying the amount of ad beaks tho

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good

There are a lot of Epstein podcasts so I chose this one off the back of its ratings and reviews. It did not disappoint. I was gripped the whole way though, great journalism, great sound quality & production, lots of things I didn‚Äôt already know. 10/10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good listen

This man was a real creep‚Äô he got killed to shut him up serve him right. I hope Ghislaine gets her day in court she‚Äôs as bad as him and is obviously being protected because she has serious dirt to throw if she needs too. All wrong. I hope the girls get their hands on he‚Äôs money they deserve it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent

Very interesting podcast! Keep them coming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good podcast but issues with playback

Really good content but cannot play all episodes properly.  They appear like each show is 20 seconds.  Another iOS bug?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gripping

I was on tenterhooks! Can‚Äôt wait for the rest

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fascinating

Look forward to complete series

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exceptional Podcast, Just Class!

Thoroughly researched, non-biased, well produced, clearly narrated ‚Ä¶ everything you want in a true crime podcast!!! I could go on & on about how brilliant this is but just see for yourself! You won‚Äôt be disappointed I promise.  I‚Äôd give more stars but there are only 5!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting but repetitive

Glad that someone is talking about this but many of the stories and interviews are repeated in multiple episodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting but way too repetitive

There's some interesting content here. But the episodes were way too repetitive. Felt like the producers are trying to drag out the programme. Stopped listening and didn't finish the episodes because of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein syndrome

Those of us who are familiar with a portion of the powerful wealthy of NYC as private contractors, service and fashion industry employees, restaurant staffs, caterers, dental-medical, etc. know Epstein is not alone as an arrogant manipulator. Epstein was sloppy as he took his exploitation to an unbridled level. Many of those interviewed live in the same bubble as Epstein, equally insecure, and unable to be outside this world of the soulless, and emotionally vapid. Epstein just got ‚Äúcaught‚Äù. Not a fan of Trump, but agree w other reviews that there is no substantive mention of Clinton‚Äôs association with Epstein and Maxwell. Tsk, tsk. Not cool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pass

Seems weird to go to all the trouble of making a podcast just to make it about Trump somehow but good luck I guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa Bloom is as despicable as Epstein.

Check out her work sabotaging Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs victims. Her fake earnest commentary is a joke. Gloria Allred shame on you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strange

The stories and life of Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs escapades is so disturbing. And I feel terrible for all his victims. But something seems odd to me with this podcast.  I know there were countless girls abused and raped, but when these actors read the diary journals there is no way on earth that 16 girls talk or write like that. The wording, expressions and thoughts quoted just don‚Äôt sound like a 16 years old. 

I don‚Äôt doubt there are diaries and accounts of these terrible things; but I have a tough time believing the ones in the podcast are truthful, or not at least have been twisted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dershowitz???

Shame on the show for spitting in the face of the victims by acting as though Dershowitz wasn‚Äôt a part of the scandal. We don‚Äôt know the truth because we weren‚Äôt there, but we should understand how hardening it would be for a victim to hear him commenting, while he was also brought up on charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
really bad sound

I didn't get past the first episode--the sound between the narrator and the audio clips wasn't matched in volume. to me, unlistenable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too many ads!!!!

At around a half hour per episode, 15 minutes is advertising. C‚Äômon guys, one ad per break, please! There are as many as three per break, sometimes the exact same ad, just repeated. Makes me not want to listen - it‚Äôs too distracting and the progress of the story is diminished.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti Trump

The author of this rag podcast is obviously anti Trump. To Trump everyone is a nice guy, even you. How come you don‚Äôt mention Billy  Clinton in your intro? Clinton had several trip pedophille Island. Oh that‚Äôs right he an elite democrap!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not impressed

I ended up bailing after about 5 episodes.   They replay the same interview more than once in an episode.  Very repetitive and just bored me to tears.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shameful

Children not under aged girls. Children cannot be prostitutes. They are victims of rape and grooming and molestation. This is absolutely disgusting!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beyond liberal

They don‚Äôt mention anything about the Clinton‚Äôs and how they were involved with his ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù and how Bill Clinton was there and participating in these actions with Epstein. The do mention trump and try to make it seem like he was involved when he wasn‚Äôt. They aren‚Äôt mentioning all the facts to protect their side and look good. Pretty sad to not mention the full truth. People deserve to know it all!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Careful with words

I‚Äôd just like to point out that many people are using the term ‚Äúunderage woman‚Äù. There‚Äôs no such thing. An under age girl is not a woman.  Absurd, but it‚Äôs clever wording to reduce the reaction to Epstein‚Äôs actions.  

Also, the fact that you can be charged for soliciting prostitution of an underaged person is insane!  By virtue of the fact they‚Äôre underage they can‚Äôt give consent. Therefore it‚Äôs not prostitution it‚Äôs trafficking, rape, sexual assault, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compelling show: I am hooked.

The interviews are fascinating (I love these varied local accents), the narrative by the host is discreet, filling in neatly between the interviews. You get to hear the story unfold from the horses‚Äô mouths, so to speak, with good editing. To the reviewers who complain there is not enough Clinton names in that expos√©: are you serious? Clinton is mentioned many times, since he was on the Epstein guest list many times. Many other prominent people were too, and their names come up too. I say: looks like your bias is showing, Clinton-bashers. Are you interested in the truth, or only comforting your biases?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not guards

To be very clear we are correction officers not guards guards. Guards watch statues. We have the responsibility of maintaining care, custody and control of the worst criminals in the world..  Do not call us guards..

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too bad

This looked promising...until the reviews...I‚Äôll get this info elsewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not even close

When you read the interviews with the victims, this isn‚Äôt even close. This is nothing more than a cover up from the left. Nothing factual.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Left Wing Hack Reporting

Tries desperately to associate Trump & Epstein. Provides cover for Bill Clinton and Obama.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Politically biased; but good.

Funny how Obama and Clinton involvements aren‚Äôt featured as prominently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearly a left wing podcast.

Anti trump left wing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundant

Stretches out content by recapping and repeating. The man claiming to be an ex-PBC policeman who fled to Russia seeking political asylum was interesting. Emphasized how big the stakes are in this case. The number of times the name Trump was referenced with no significant facts was telling. Clinton ties were brushed over where there was real opportunity to dig deeper. Lying about the number of times on Lolita Express deserves some investigation, no?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4stars

Any review on this pod cast claiming bias against Donald Trump is playing bitter politics. It was as good as any true crime podcasts in its presentation. Very informative, interesting and completely fair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein: Devil in the darkness.

Good podcast. Quite revealing. States trump was closer to Epstein than he would like everyone to know. There‚Äôs videos on all who visited Epstein‚Äôs facilities for blackmail purposes. I‚Äôd like to see trump‚Äôs videos.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dick suckers

hope you guys are sucking trumps dick with how much you‚Äôll defend a man you don‚Äôt know. 

GREAT JOB GIRL. loved it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...no thanx

You lost me with your bias against Trump.  Too bad, too. I enjoy listening to different podcasts about the same topic, but this one I‚Äôm skipping. Your slant against Trump is irrelevant considering the magnitude and horrific details of the story.  Epic fail. Zero stars if I could have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoyed it overall but a bit repetitive

I really enjoyed this podcast and it kept my attention as I listened to all of it in about a week during my commute. However, in my honest opinion I think this could have been done with a couple less episodes. There were several times when I looked to re-check I wasn‚Äôt replaying an older episode because some of the interview recordings are used multiple times for different episodes. I see where it might have been for emphasis but it seemed like they were running out of details to support the episodes. Even with this negative, I feel it was pretty good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way too much political bias!

Way too much political bias! We get it, the orator hates President Trump and ignores the fact that Slick Willy Clinton was on his plane 26 times, and the hildabeast was probably on there some as well

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointed

A lot of opinions,  speculation and repetitive interviews.  You would‚Äôve thought that Donald Trump was in the flight log 26 times and not Bill Clinton!!.  She barely touched on Clinton‚Äôs relationship with Epstein,  while constantly mentioning Trump being associated.
Very unfortunate,  podcast had potential,  but dragged it out and left out a lot of facts and replaced them with their opinions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decent - but has a political agenda

I thought for the most part it was a decent pod cast regarding the origins and build up to Eprteins death. However, through out the pod cast she took it upon herself to interject political vitriol regarding President Trump and AG Barr. But when it came to the Clintons and all the other big name left leaning Epsteinites she downplayed and almost apologized for them. Dont waste your time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Waste of time

Don‚Äôt bother listening to this, doesn‚Äôt even tell a story. 

Complete waste of my time. Wish I could get it back so I could listen to something worthwhile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disaster!

The political bias makes it intolerable to listen to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good listen

I want to make this perfectly clear. Our current President had nothing to do with Epstein after his conviction in 2005. But Clinton and his hag wife were on his plane, and island 26 times. Bill Clinton is a rapist, and his wife an enabler. Hopefully one day, they end up in prison where I get both belong

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Glad I Listened!

It‚Äôs unbelievable how many people in powerful positions delight in raping children.  Including current and former sitting Presidents.  Mind bowing podcast!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Typical liberal lies

Sorry leftist I won‚Äôt be listening to your lies. You will find it was Clinton and never Trump on the Island. Trump 2020 make liberals cry again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Political nonsense. No new information

Trump‚Äôs name thrown in a much as possible. Propaganda BS. Bill Clinton 20 plus flight record on Epstein‚Äôs plane mentioned only in passing. Offers no new info on his suicide/homicide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had high hopes but just another liberal leaning podcast

Really liked it for a few episodes then they got sooooo blame trump and started ignoring Clinton‚Äôs every picture I see on internet show trump with girlfriend at a social event not chasing children.   Can someone please have a podcast without political bias

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not listening after reading reviews

Saved me time I will not listen to more Trump bashing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About what you‚Äôd expect

Out of sheer boredom I decided to listen to this podcast. I had a suspicion what it would eventually turn into & I was right. Somehow, but very much to be expected, the host & a whole swath of guests manage to turn this into an indictment of Donald Trump & Bill Barr. And it heavily features Lisa Bloom who was a big defender of Harvey Weinstein which is only mentioned in passing. And no mention that her mother is Gloria Allred who‚Äôs a fame chasing media celebrity herself. 

The story is nothing you don‚Äôt already know. And this serves up all the conspiracy theories you can digest. Production is ok but nothing special. The host is quite annoying in her presentation which detracts from everything else. And of course the all too convenient overlooking all the left wing involvement & donations of Jeffrey Epstein makes this incomplete & a waste. Listen with complete skepticism if you have the time. Otherwise skip it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is everything about Trump

Every opportunity was taken to bring up Trump‚Äôs name.  Wrote this review and deleted from my Library.  Ridiculous

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardly an Indictment on Epstein

Podcast is hardly to critique Epstein and his lewd sexual acts. More so an indictment on wealth and men. Political bias run amok. Hackneyed opinions regarding law and wealth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Huh?

I‚Äôd like to know who is actually behind this podcast because the Clinton connection is mentioned in passing and pretty much glossed over. In contrast Trump is mentioned as often as possible. I don‚Äôt like Trump so the motivation in pointing this out isn‚Äôt partisan. This seems like misdirection bordering on propaganda.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa Bloom hypocrisy

Lisa Bloom is also representing Harvey Weinstein

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enough Content for half as many episodes

Whilst the story and facts are fascinating, they could have been presented in a much more crisp and effective manner in half as many episodes. The amount of repeated sound bites and interviews is quite frustrating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repetition

There is some interesting information in this podcast but I found all of the repeated sound bites annoying. I guess they needed to fill up the time and didn‚Äôt have enough new information, so they just kept pasting in the same lines from the same people episode after episode. Also, is Alan Dershowitz a personal friend of someone involved in this project? Why else would we hear repeatedly from this guy who has made a career out of defending misogynists? So, we know Epstein was guilty and that Prince Andrew is very likely guilty of having enjoyed the services of Epstein‚Äôs underage sex slaves, but we are to believe that Dershowitz, who has been directly accused of enjoying Epstein‚Äôs services by Virginia Roberts Giuffre is innocent? All he did was attempt to broker sweetheart deals for Epstein when he was arrested for sex trafficking the first time. Seriously! The fact that you give Dershowitz so much air time in the podcast is offensive. And now he is on the Trump (also accused of raping an underage girl at an Epstein party) impeachment defense team. It was revolting to hear Lisa Bloom calling out other women for throwing  Epstein‚Äôs victims under the bus. Written any more memos to Harvey Weinstein lately Lisa? I had to stop listening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you

I was going to listen to this but read the reviews, thank you thank you thank you for not wasting my time by listening!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meh

Hard to take it completely seriously when you have Lisa Bloom chastising everyone connected to Epstein, when she‚Äôs on Weinstein‚Äôs payroll.

I also didn‚Äôt totally appreciate how they dropped a huge bomb in the final minutes of the final episode and then basically said, ‚Äúgo buy the book!!‚Äù. üòí

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phony

Awful, 
The rumors & speculation you already heard. 
Audio is mostly that fake telephone effect you hear on radio ads when the actor is supposed to sound like an actual customer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too bad

Podcast was just okay.  Lots of repeated clips which is frustrating for the listener.  At times I thought maybe I was replaying a prior episode.  Ruined it in Episode 12 by including political opinion and Trump bashing.  Too bad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Missed opportunity

Interviews were interesting and, obviously, the subject matter is pertinent. However, the amount of repeated interview clips is maddening. Could have covered everything in 5 or 6 episodes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No New Information

There were no definitive conclusions and so many repeated audio clips from random loosely connected people speculating on his life. Why and how on earth would his driver really know anything about his personal life if he claims he just treated him like trash? People like him and the other house workers sounded like they just repeated vague news headlines. The guy in Russia‚Äôs hidden tapes script was just so unbelievable too. He was fumbling on his clearly scripted words and it sounds like it was ripped from a cheesy spy movie. I‚Äôve honestly learned more about this case from hundreds of random Reddit comments and articles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lost all credibility

I can‚Äôt take seriously an ‚Äúinvestigative‚Äù podcast about sexual assault and harassment when you give someone like Lisa Bloom (who secretly helped Harvey Weinstein in covering up his wrongdoings- as reported in She Said) and Alan Dershowitz (who was immersed in Epstein‚Äôs world and named as a sexual assaulter). How can you give either of these people a voice?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not critical enough of official narrative

Spends too much time talking to Alan Dershowitz and Lisa Bloom, legal figures who‚Äôve over the years worked on Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs defense, and yes, Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs. They‚Äôre not so much lawyers as they are PR reps, and this podcast is just another piece of establishment spin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Material

There‚Äôs stuff here you might not have heard before, including lots of original interviews that make it worth listening to. There‚Äôs a few other podcasts about Epstein out there at the moment; this one does the best job clarifying how evil, dark and twisted Epstein and his operation ‚Äî as well as the world of rich people and academics who enabled/ are enabling the abuse ‚Äî truly is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Barr and Trump

I loved this till you slammed Barr and Trump. You  obviously don‚Äôt know Barr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So much repeating

The same clips are being repeated in multiple episodes that makes you question if you‚Äôve listened to the episode previously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapt 12

Why does your podcast sound like it‚Äôs on fast forward? Episode 12 you‚Äôre literally speaking a million miles per hour. Makes it hard to listen to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repetitive

Found many of the sound bites used repeatedly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Happened to Journalism?

Was going to listen to it until I read the first sentence. Good job üëç

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Love it

Very informative well done podcast!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not comparable to the other podcasts on Epstein

I became obsessed with listening to every Epstein podcast and I would not recommend this one. They producers did not deal with the victims with as much care or sensitivity. Other reviews point out the use Lisa Bloom who worked with Weinstein and betrayed her own clients. I would recommend Mysterious Mr Epstein, Real Crime Profile, and Broken Mr.Epstein. They do not sensationalize the story and give more care to victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really??

You have Dershowitz - accused of raping underage girls with Epstein, and Lisa Bloom?!?  She defended Weinstein and smeared his victims.  Not exactly someone who champions women‚Äôs rights.  Really disgusted when I heard them being given even a second of airtime.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The chauffeur is not credible

The story is excellent. The narration is great.  But the chauffeur should not have been giving an opinion. He criticized the  pilots but was guilt of what he criticized them for, he should have known what was going on. And you used him as an expert base on his opinion and that hurts the story because he was flip flopping. Still a 4 out of 5 stars.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sources

Interviewing Alan Dershowitz, who has been implicated in the same crimes as Epstein, and named by Virginia as one of the men she spent time with, is an extremely odd choice. Acting like he is an expert on the case, while never mentioning his connections to these crimes, erases all credibility by the reporters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It‚Äôs a twelve episode ad to buy their book

Few to no conclusions and the end was just ‚Äúbuy this book to hear the whole story.‚Äù Kind of a waste of time in the end, nothing that I didn‚Äôt already learn from a handful of articles that came out when he died.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Audio disappointing!

All of the phone call audio excerpts are incredibly distracting due to the poor audio quality. Very disappointing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fascinating!!

So many facets of the Epstein case are brought to life in this podcast. You‚Äôll hear from many who were victims or witnesses to Epstein‚Äôs long crimes. Did he truly commit suicide or was he murdered? Listen and find out!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So this whole thing...

...was a crummy commercial for a book. Bleh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very Intriguing but,,,

I really enjoyed your coverage of this weird man who manipulated so many.
The women/girls should be compensated after all the FBI‚Äôs release of documents found. Although I‚Äôm not sure it will happen.
  My wonder is the last episode (#12) had me puzzled why Trump was thrown under the bus when Clinton flew on ‚ÄúThe Lolitta Express‚Äù like a kid at an amusement park and, you made no mention of him at all. 
Many other people had longer relationships with him than President Trump!
  That seems like a bit of an agenda.
Just report what you know and, we‚Äôll think for ourselves.
Other than that, great job!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many episodes?

Good story.  However, at episode 10 they announced, ‚Äústay tuned for the final episode...‚Äù, and I think it‚Äôs been said for the past few episodes.  So... when is the final episode?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrific- OJ Simpson story all over again

This will be a 12 episode series. The story has legs. Congratulations!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too much conspiracy theory nonsense

The podcast is entertaining, but there are far, far too many inferences unsupported by reliable evidence that lead it down the road of conspiracy theory drivel. Fact witnesses are asked for their opinions about topics in which they have provided no expertise and no supporting evidence, so it can be very frustrating if you‚Äôre used to hard journalism. If you‚Äôre interested in this case, the Broken podcast stays in its lane far better. The value of this podcast is to supplement Broken with more witness interviews.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disguised as an investigative work, but has clear agenda

I was with this podcast until the last episode when it takes a turn for the bizarre and the host reveals that the producer has a book coming out in early December. I don‚Äôt mind that the producer has a book to sell and has a clear (but very bizarre) theory of the case, but both of those things should have been made clear up front, not 11 episodes in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repetitive

Like other listeners, I found the constant repeating of information tiring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Story We All Want To Hear.....

........but not delivered by this childish sounding narrator who seems to be reading from a script with no understanding of the story she‚Äôs telling. Nothing new here. And‚ÄîEnough already! So redundant and each short new episode repeats half of the last. I don‚Äôt think there is any real reporting here, just a compilation of existing reports and interviews. The most appalling part of this podcast continues to be the narrator who constantly introduces herself. If I were her I‚Äôd hide and never reveal my name. She would make a great children‚Äôs book narrator though!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stop blaming Trump

I‚Äôm so tired of this podcast trying to put the blame for Epstein on President Trump. If you want more answers focus on Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.  Throughout this podcast Clinton has been given a pass with only a suggestion that Epstein should not have been invited to the wedding.  REALLY?  How about not being on the Lolita Express over 26 times!!!  For a good dive into Epstein the slime ball I would pass on this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa Bloom is discretited

I can believe this podcast features  Lisa Bloom, a Harvey Weinstein advisor. Weinstein paid her to discredit his victims.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Power

If you haven‚Äôt researched the story of The Franklin Coverup, please do. It‚Äôs likely that Jacob Wetterling was one of their abductees. The powerful elite have been systematically abusing boys and girls for generations. 

Research missing people in Haiti- Clinton Foundation. There are heinous crimes going unchallenged and unreported by mainstream media, which is owned by the very same powerful elite. 

Please get your most tenacious investigative team to dig deep and expose any and every aspect of this dangerous fraternity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hit & Miss

Very engaging and horrifying story but the inclusion of Alan Dershowitz and Lisa Bloom (two of the shadiest lawyers in America) was an unwelcome intrusion into an otherwise solid podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bull

Right away the summary has to mention President Trump while it was President Bill Clinton who visited often with this pedo and which he had a painted portrait of Bill in a woman‚Äôs dress. ABC News net refused to air this pedo 3 years ago and fired the person who exposed ABC. The media protects its own at the expense of the truth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So repetitive

The story is so intriguing and disgusting, but a lot of time was spent replaying the same audio over and over again. The chauffeur‚Äôs ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it at the time but I see it now and can put it all together‚Äù was played for like 4 episodes in a row. You didn‚Äôt need that filler.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE THE COUPON CODE NAME FOR YOUR ADS!!!!

This disgusting monster‚Äôs last name should not be the coupon code name for the ads in this podcast! This is appalling! I wouldn‚Äôt use his name for any type of gain. Please change this!!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like it

I just finished the 6th episode. I hope as this podcast progresses that more information about all of the people involved becomes more available. 
I want to know all the names; the media owners, more about Bill Gates, more about the Clintons, more about foreign activity from China, S America, Russia...
I want to know how big this really is. 
I hope this podcast gets much deeper.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Commentary by Lisa Bloom?

An entertaining, informative and slickly produced podcast. I was enjoying it but the Lisa Bloom segment was surprising, not in a good way. I‚Äôll pass.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look Into Lisa Bloom

Great podcast until Lisa Bloom is presented as if she‚Äôs a victim‚Äôs advocate. Read her emails between her and Weinstein. Her credibility is shot with me, just wish more people knew this. She‚Äôs flipping sides depending on where they money/fame comes from.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when the MSM laughed a Pizzagate

Then we find out that same MSM has been running cover for the elite pedos. Just look at the latest Project Veritas vid. Pizzagate is real and so is QAnon. Notice they are treating QAnon the same exact way?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great story but..

Honestly the timeline of how this story is laid out is so hard to follow. It feels like each episode contains relatively the same information and there‚Äôs not a clear progression between episodes. A great, and devastating story but I think this podcast kind of missed the mark. The Mysterious Mr. Epstein is a great one if anyone is hoping to hear more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The courageous investigative journalism that the victims deserve

This is the only podcast that includes real investigative journalism attempting to unravel the mystery of the epstien case. Devil in the darkness does an excellent job hilighting the bizzare details of the case while keeping everything substantiated and avoiding speculation. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in the case.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy listening

This so called investigative serial on Epstein is quite on the frothy side, more like the ‚ÄúPeople Magazine‚Äù version.  The sources/commentators are a little hard to stomach, especially Lisa Bloom who was Weinstein legal enabler / protector. I find her outrage for her victims at the hands of Epstein to be disingenuous to say the least . And the chauffeur? Talk about turning a blind eye. I think you would have to be deaf and blind not to know what was going on. The same with the housekeeper at the NM ranch. Money is everything and everyone has a price.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too political

Very political and so hard to believe so many of these people interviewed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointed

I was really hoping to gain more information on this Epstein case. However, I heard more about Prince Andrew and hardly any information about Epstein. You replayed several parts and only mentioned Clinton‚Äôs involvement twice. Unsubscribe!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Great!

Thank you for your investigation into this scum et al. Keep up the fantastic work!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointing but interesting

I feel like this has so much potential due to the nature of his crimes and obscene wealth. But you hear the same recycled audio in each episode from the same 3 people. Wish there was more information or the interviews were a little more detailed. Really did not like hearing from the driver how the pilots were bad people when he was in the same position to do something himself he even said it. Same with Deidre her job was to procure ‚Äúmassage therapists‚Äù I felt her input was not beneficial to the story at all. Maybe should have waited to put out a story  when there was more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloom

You‚Äôve got Bloom on your podcast - Ronan Farrow  had something to say about her

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Episode 6 should be called.....

STAFF BREAKS SILENCE AND PLAY STUPID. Each one of them said they saw young girls in and out of his house but didn‚Äôt know what was going on because ‚Äúno one talked about it‚Äù or ‚Äúsaid anything‚Äù and ‚Äúhe never touched them out in the open‚Äù. Are we supposed to be sympathetic to them? What was the purpose of this episode? No new information was given nor does it help the situation because all of them kept their mouths shut for over 10 years. The driver is ridiculous. How could he condemn the pilots when he doing the exact same thing, picking up and dropping off the girls!?!?!? Just because they saw their ID. So you have been this mans driver for 10 years and every single girl you picked ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù looked of age. He sometimes only had to wait for a couple hours for them. I wonder if he thinks when you rent motels by the hour it‚Äôs only for sleeping purposes. You and your work buddies would call him a pedo!?!? It made me cringe when he said that the girls would be in a better mood after they left. That‚Äôs because $300 is a lot for a TEENAGER! But hey I get it Epstein was the only rich guy in New York that needed a driver and house staff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decent

Good listen! Expose everybody though! Even Bill Clinton!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One sided?

Where is all the dirt on all the democrats? Other than that good story

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ugh

The chauffeur is the worst... has nothing relevant to say and they just keep repeating him saying ‚Äúthe pilots were nice guys.‚Äù  Skip this podcast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Choppy, but interesting story

The story jumps around a lot, repeats itself, and introduces and, almost verbatim, reintroduces characters and settings. I kept asking myself, ‚ÄúWait, didn‚Äôt I already hear this one?‚Äù

That said, it‚Äôs worth listening to. The story is insane. The gist? There‚Äôs credible evidence that global power players like Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew has sex with minors at Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs mansions and on his private jet. Epstein probably didn‚Äôt commit suicide. And, lastly, there‚Äôs probably videos of all the sex acts and they‚Äôre with a guy who is hiding out in Russia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filling in

I just started listening to this podcast and also Broken. Both are covering different victims and witnesses filling in the gaps.  As these progress I look forward to how and when they start indicting those vial accomplices, whom are dining well, living life. I read about Ebstein in 2016 and watched the political wheels of both the Clintons and Trump neither of which would open this can of worms. Now we all know why. Ecstatic, they have shamed Acosta -  slime balls- all of them. Wish Ebstein was still alive in prison, he  got off easy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good story

Worth a listen . Was disappointed that it‚Äôs episode 4 and Bill Clinton is mysteriously missing from the story. Being a hard hitting journalist means setting your personal , political leanings aside. You lose journalistic credibility when you go out of your way to shield well known democrats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too politically focused!

And Clinton‚Äôs an angel. Way to left leaning. More like propaganda

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lisa Bloom? Really?

You need to erase her and her Mother from your podcast. Weinstein taint on them both. I dont believe a word they say. And Bloom thinks Andrew should own up and be honest. Huh. There‚Äôs the pot calling the kettle black. Don‚Äôt give them airtime please. I might have to delete this from my library.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Californians

The Kardashian ruins what would have been a decent show

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Repetitive

Not really any proof, just repetitive here say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Politics ruin it.

Always have to bring in Trump. Like or dislike him he has little to do with Epstein. It seems as though many people in higher places with more power than a New York business man( Clinton, Prince Andrew), also thought Epstein was a ‚ÄúTerrific Guy‚Äù. I am an independent so this is not a Donald loving review, I am just so tired of hearing about him in every pod cast can‚Äôt you keep politics out of it? We all need a break and just want to be entertained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good but

Get a real British person to do Andrew‚Äôs accent-surely they can‚Äôt be hard to find. The American dude faking his accent has to go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good but could improve

The story is good, a little out of order. The audio isn‚Äôt that great at times because it‚Äôs a lot of phone calls

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LISA BLOOM IS A DISGRACE

Why on earth would you air Lisa Bloom on this podcast. She is a Weinstein enabler & shares her very low opinion with Weinstein about women who report abuse.

She is disgusting. So is her Mother.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interesting But Hard To Follow

It‚Äôs a terrific story. And I‚Äôll keep listening. But because information is presented non-chronologically - and sometimes with no date at all - and because information on the same topic is presented in different episodes, the podcast is confused, confusing, and, occasionally, apparently self contradictory. As a result, the podcast raises more questions than it answers. Michael Dugan‚Äôs story, in the bonus episode, is an example. 

Dugan says that he obtained copies of Epstein‚Äôs blackmail videos from the lead investigator in the Palm Beach case; that the investigator died mysteriously shortly after Epstein‚Äôs arrest; that the FBI, claiming to have a sealed indictment, searched Dugans house - and, inexplicably, without arresting Dugan despite the claimed indictment - seized the videos (presumably Dugan copied them and concealed copies); that the tapes and their decryption codes are now with persons in 5 countries; but none of them have both the codes and tapes; and that Dugan has set up a plan for videos to be disclosed should anything happen to him. Dugan ? In the Russian Federation under a grant of asylum, fearing for his safety and his family‚Äôs. 

Dugan‚Äôs story - for which Dugan offers little evidence or analysis - reads like a Tom Clancy novel. But not a word of it, to my knowledge, has been reported in the U. S. media.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I like it BUT...

Why are they including any input from Lisa Bloom and Gloria Allred? Those two hypocrites represented Harvey Weinstein and helped him cover up his predation. More proof you can‚Äôt trust anyone in this world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstein

Just another slam on Trump! More political BS to make Trump look bad. Trump had nothing to do with Epstein. Trumps testimony to authorities was instrumental in Epstein‚Äôs arrest in 2008. Also Epstein was banned from Trumps night club after he tried to proposition a 14 year old at the club. Sounds like the podcast got their information from the mainstream media. I don‚Äôt trust any of this because of the little false implication that Trump was anything like Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sides

It is really obvious who are you try to trash and then you suggest that Clinton just use his plane ha ha ha the man is a pervert and Epstein even have a picture of Clinton in his house.....I don‚Äôt even want to go to de other men that you try to clean up. I listen to three episodes and could not even finished that one because your biases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really...

Lol the excuses people make. ‚ÄúThese stories are just like conspiracy theories. I don‚Äôt know why politics are being brought up....‚Äù etc etc etc.  Do you other reviewers really think this man magically got rich? Please. Blackmail. Period. You won‚Äôt ever see the proof on others either. Guarantee it‚Äôs been destroyed already.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confused

So in listening to episode 3 there is some confusing facts. One person says Chris Rock was a known passenger and someone else says it was Chris Tucker. Whichever Chris was not involved with Mr Epstein I can imagine might be pretty upset with having his names linked to Mr Epstein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epstine

I don‚Äôt understand why everyone had to speak so fast. Please slow down the speed. Some of the words are running together and it is difficult to understand.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ummm politics much?!

I wanted to hear about Epstein - not how Trump was definitely his friend but Clinton barely knew him - that‚Äôs not even possibly true considering Clinton flew on his plane 27 times and Trump kicked him out of Mar a largo for soliciting underage girls. Listen to this podcast if you want a weird pro Clinton slant to this but I call BS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gritting my teeth every time the narrator says Ghislaine

They‚Äôve interviewed people who‚Äôve met her and know how to say it. Just mimic that!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good but check out Hidden Truth Show!

The Hidden Truth Show podcast does great deep dive interviews with people close to Epstein. This one is a good start; check out hidden truth show to go deeper.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Too much conjecture

I was midway through the second episode before I stopped listening and unsubscribed. The people interviewed provide no facts just opinions, especially the female journalist whose name I can‚Äôt remember. There are plenty of facts on this monster available. Listening to that woman comment on how his house did not live up to palm beach standards was enough for me to turn it off.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trump didn‚Äôt like him.

You discredit yourself in the first 3 sentences. Next.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappointing turn around time

Honestly way too long yo be waiting for a subsequent episode. What is this 2004?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great podcast

Thank you interviews great can‚Äôt wait to hear the rest.  Don‚Äôt pay any attention to negative reviews.  Well done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So far pretty good

Never heard of JE until the charges came out. An interesting listen to this and decide whether he was a genius or a grifter.   I don‚Äôt know where the disparaging reviews are coming from, I am truly enjoying the listen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good start

Really enjoying this so far. Not sure what this silly recent spate of bad reviews (mostly referring to the host‚Äôs voice) is about. I find it very well produced and easy to listen to. Methinks another (less well-produced, more chatty) podcast covering Epstein might be defensively posting bad reviews...allegedly. I tried that one, but the hosts are really off-putting. Unlike the other one, this podcast has great interviews with actual people in the know. Keep up the good work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Facts

This really shows the sad facts drawn  from years of investigating this horrific story. Well done-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Made by a sex pervert

Hosted by a sex pervert

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can‚Äôt believe it

There are SO many details in this that I‚Äôve never heard. Wish it was longer! Can‚Äôt wait for next week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Talks way too fast

There is no speed adjustment in settings. OMG the narrator sounds like she had a dozen shots of espresso mixed with Adderall & Red Bull! Horrible narration

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Know your material!

I found it jarring that your narrator repeatedly mispronounced Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs name.  The ‚ÄúS‚Äù is silent ‚Äî which is evident on any cable network or by listening to the woman interviewed in this segment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soooooo Gooood

This is so interesting and good. So many details I didn‚Äôt know. I wish it came on twice a week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Insight Into a Twisted Case

The story of Jeffrey Epstein is so bizarre, twisted and mysterious that it's tough to know what to believe. This podcast seems to be providing some welcome illumination, and I'm curious to see where it goes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really good!

Loved The First Episode! Really goes into detail on how insane he truly was!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conspiracies

I love them! Can‚Äôt wait to hear where this goes!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Plot Thickens

And so, the plot thickens. Can't wait to hear how this insane story unfolds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let the games begin!

I‚Äôm already hooked and ready for the next episode!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so so excited for this!!

cannot wait to hear more

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, this should be fun!

The story that keeps growing. This one sounds juicy!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So real time!

Looking forward to listening to listening to the real time reporting!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
