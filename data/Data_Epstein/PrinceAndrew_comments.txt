Emily did a fantastic job. / []
Last week was my birthday. No party. I just had a “straight-forward shooting weekend”.  Now the neighbors dogs are missing. / []
What a POS...he deserves every "demotion" his brother, aunt and nephew give him! / []
How stupid can you be to let someone take a picture of you next to a sex trafficker and your victim? / ['Because they had and do have power. As well as thinking ah this will never come out']

Now that epstein is gone, andrew is probably the worlds biggest creep / []
At 31:45 can someone explain what on earth he's talking about?! The response doesn't answer the question... / []
Your content keeps getting better. / []
What a liar! Damn!! / []
Didn't mention the money did he?. Apparently Fergie sent Andrew for their pocket money. Fergie had him do her dirty work and Epstein threw him a fish to keep him happy. / []
Andrew is stammering quite a bit, it doesn't sound like the truth. What a liar! / []
Lieing lo life ,should  be in prison / []
Who allowed him to do this interview, Cleary whom ever it was knew that he was guilty and let him hang on his on rope. This man is vile. He is so arrogant and believed he could get away with it for who he thought he was, absolutely vile. Nobody says I don’t believe I’m met her, you say it never happened. What a bloody idiot. / []
Jesus Christ / []
I’d say both parties r at fault… Too many women lie and he stammers around and seems way too nervous… js / []
Lier / []
Absolutely no indication… and if there was…. Wow… he never saw them..??wow…… just wow…. / []
Monsters in the monarchy front and centre dispicable  criminal jail him, come and use my houses and the children within them / []

Dont remember any of it but that pizza I had 18 years ago was amazing! 🍕 / []
Straight forward shooting weekend……….. Yeah we all throw them at the weekend😮! / []
What a despicable and hypocrite person.  Trying to deny the facts that are so clear. He was Epstein’s friend and was delighted with the sexual benefits he got from the friendship.  Asqueroso personaje! / []
41:00 How did he do it? How did he get to where he was? Through your enablement Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. Through your complicity. And many others. / []
32:00 This point is particularly hurtful. He is basically saying sex is a positive act for him.  It's hard to forget a positive act. But he can't remember it. Then says it didn't happen. And if it had been positive he would have remembered it. Classic narcissistic move. In one swift move he is saying she means absolutely nothing to him and he doesn't remember her. It's designed to be hurtful and make her feel like nothing. Yet he refuses to say she is lying. It's a disaster of an interview. He could not look more guilty if he tried. I agree with Virginia 'He knows exactly what he has done and he needs to come clean'.  However it's almost impossible to get a narcissist to admit accountability sadly. / ['🎉correct❤']
He is so full of himself  and not particularly bright he is not even realizing he is making a fool of himself...his attitude...gosh...lost all respect for the Queen knowing how she always protected him... / []

Someone  should get Ghislaine Maxwell hooked up to a Lie detector test and ask her if Andrew was  at her flat with  the girl, and did he have sex with her? offer her a reduced sentence as an incentive.  You can see the glee in his face (The ahaa moment) when he is about to answer the question  about being at Pizza Express.  He is thinking " this is such a great answer and makes complete sense to everyone who is watching" A man of my eminence, the Prince of England wouldn't be dinning at a Pizza express, so obviously it would have been a memorial thing to do... That's it... I'm off the hook. Well, You could say that going to Tramps nightclub is also very unusual for a prince of England to do, but somehow you don't remember it Andy... If I was at a Night club and Prince Andrew rocked up... I would definitely remember it and would be telling everyone I met the next day... All eyes would have been on him, so surely most people at the club remembers him dancing with a young blonde girl,  why don't these people come forward and confirm? There must have been CCTV footage of him going in or coming out of the club... Also If I was a bouncer at the door, I would have tipped off a Journo for a few quid.. / []
I would love to know... how thought this interview was a good idea... he doesn't say a single word without stuttering all over the place...the man is lying through his ugly teeth constantly... it is time to take down all these "powerful " men who think they can do what they want...yikes / []
“My tendency of being too honorable” / []
Every time I watch this... this idiots IQ drops another twenty percent / []
He is ridiculous / []
Replace the Journalist,replace her with Michael Mansfield in his prime,then Andrew would be in Stocks. Harder for a journalist,easier for a man of law to rip apart.He would have being left without his perverted ankle socks..Also his beloved teddy bears pic-nick..Taking nothing away from the Journalist who has spanked his Lies nice and easy,could you just imagine a lawyer putting that idiot in the dock? Always defending the impossible... / []
Can anybody justify why did Virginia took a 16M settlement and bought a house in Australia? / []
Watching this again after watching the 60 minutes Australia with the victim / []
I watched this with one eye shut. Its incredibly painful to watch because its SO obvious that he was bullshitting through his teeth.  What a circus. / []
still not sweating / []
Need to update the title 😅 / []
ANDREW HAS DEMENTIA HE DOESNT REMEMBER ANYTHING, DOESNT REMEMBER MEETING PEOPLE DOESNT REMEMBER PARTYING WITH EPSTEIN AND ANY UNDER AGE GIRLS, TIME HE WENT INTO A SANITORIUM FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR MEMORY. / []
You can tell he is a part of that. / []

Bleeeeh Mr. Andy! Shut up you cretine / []
Nasty royals / []
I cannot believe how honourable he is / []
God i find this hard to watch / []
Brought that trash to the queens house. 300 yrs ago he'd lost his head. He doesn't remember the photo taken but remembers the upstairs of Epstein's dump? This is a man that lived in 5 k room castles at times. But remembers the little shack's upstairs? Why? Because it's where all the nasty went on. She's in the picture because she could pass for 18-19. Much younger were as he says upstairs. 8,9, 10 yrs olds. And everyone thought Charles or Diana was the worst F ups. I'm surprised he didn't mention Diana hanging out with Michael Jackson. I know many loved DI but she was just as crazy/careless and hung out with some real creeps. I'm thinking the queen left this life her only hope William . not burning the Kingdom down. Long Live  William the son the queen never had. I think queen Camilla handled her situation well . And Kate will make a great queen. But to me I was born 1967 and American from the deep southern United States. Elizabeth the II will always be my queen. God bless her❤️ / []
lots of contradictions wow. / []
Impressive that he remembered being at a kids birthday party almost 25 years later. I can't even remember what I did last week 😂😂 He gives all the cues of a man lying to save his arse. / []
What an absolute car crash of an interview. He should be embarrassed by this.  I'm sat here laughing at how outrageous his attempts to wiggle out of it are. You can't be sure that's my hand. Oh my gosh 😂😂😂 Absolute word salad. / []
I went to stay with him to tell him we couldn't be seen together 😂 Lies trip so easily off this man's tongue I wonder if he has ever told the truth about anything. What a joke. Fess up. Admit the truth. And give your victims some credit. I 100% believe Virginia and its time for justice. / []
Xd / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
What a car crash he definitely has not done himself any favours at all with this interview you  can tell he is lying and well done for keeping calm and collective  interviewing andrew / []

Liar / []
What an embarrassment / []
uk is land of more on. entire thing should be dismantled, but you fools pretend like these hustlers got duties. 😅😅😅. to steal from u useful idiots 🙄 / []
Imagine telling people he stayed over at Epstein's house and went for a walk with him the following morning just to tell him he no longer wants to know him lmao he's  so used to people having to buy everything he's said his whole life that he doesn't even entertain the fact people would see through his completely blatant and obvious lies . / ['yes, very weird. amazing', '\u200b@JinkyAdamscrazy 😂']
Staying in his houses, in United States,  Private Island?. New York Mansion,,, Slumming it again? They were all convenient places to stay. / ['It was very kind of Jeffrey to make such an offer.']

Andrew .... Thinking hard,  to himself ... Mmmm ??? Mmmm ??? "Yes ,if I say that,that might work ??? "  Total car crash , of an interview.  His body language is telling  a different story of his events. / []
This guy stutters an awful lot for someone who's telling the "truth" / ['Looking at some of his older Interviews I must say this is a linguistic peculiarity of Andrew.']
Old Mate Andrew certainly has Dimention / ['Dementia lol', '\u200b@sararossborough5363 he has dimension']

I’ve never had sex……….lol / []
" I don t regret, because there were people being !useful! for me"....no further quote needed..disgusting...and he didn t want to "be seen with Eppstein" because of his image to avoid HIS disadvantage. No word about how disgusting this is. / []

The bit that you remember andrew is filling children with horror and other substances. / []
I'm not even watching the interview..I'm just reading the comments 😂 / []
I wanted to stay on side with this old Prince but him saying I don't really know why I went to see him when he was found guilty and been to prison.  He shouldn't have been seeing him because of his lifestyle and what he was doing.  This Andrew should have need the law to show him the way.  Horrible, makes me believe he knew exactly what he was doing and that he was partaking in it. Truly vile, King and Prince William will sort him. Goodbye. / []
Can't take him seriously!. 😊 / []
how can he have been arrested this year if he is dead ??????? / []
What AN absolute Money Making IDIOT / []

I don't think I ever went upstairs 😂... / []
That's definitely me I don't think it's a picture of me in London 😂 / []
Andrew: I never really have partied🎉.... It was his girlfriend that was the key element in this he was the plus one 😂 It was a shooting weekend.....😂 There was no indication (that he trafficked children)..😮 Well I ceased contact with him😂 It was a small dinner 😂 yeah ok I was there at a dinner...😂 It was a convenient place to stay 😂.. My tendancy to be too honourable 😂. I don't know Mr Brockman.... I actually only saw him the dinner party and the walk in park and the passage 😂 Somebody very cleverley took that photograph ( in the park) 😂... I had to go and see him ...😂 I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady....😂 It didn't happen 😂 I don't know where the bar is in tramp  I don't drink , Ive never bought a drink in tramp....😂 I was at a pizza express in Woking 😂😂 I was at home 😂 I don't sweat, I didn't sweat at the time 😂.... There's a medical condition that says I didn't do it...😂 It never happened 😂... I have no memory of that photo being taken 😂..... That's me but whether that's my hand 😂..... / []
Poor Andrew falling for being interviewed by Emily Matlis!! / []

I wonder how he misused the nspcc full stop campaign. Child trafficking / ['He knew what to look for']
I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened 😮.....really😂 / []
The photograph was taken upstairs....I don't remember ever going up there😂.... / []
I knew Royal never commented publicly on any accusations. / []
I have simply no recollection of that photo ever been taken.....I don't remember that photograph ever been taken....we can't be certain whether that's my hand on her left side .....😅 Nobody can prove that the photo has been doctored😂 / []
Pig / []
His "work". Lol. / []
This is where you shot your self in the foot! You should have never done this interview. You walked straight into the lions mouth / []
england needs to wake up this scumbag and his relatives need abolishment.  Pigs🎉 / ['Some of us have!']
If he was in tramp that night , i wonder why no one else has said they saw him there ? And no one took a picture of him? Odd as he was a prince and famous back then . / []
He had plenty of time to go to tramp after the birthday party places like tramp club opens around 10 pm and closes around 2am / []
Imagine how dumb this guy would have turn out to be without the millions of pounds invested in his education and the months of coaching for the interview. That's privilege. / []
He probably isn't even the most disgusting and perverse out of all the royals. They should all be thrown in jail. / []
I dont know the name of the interviewer but she is low key brilliant / []
Why would a so called prince need to " stay with people"??? no hotels??? / []
Those podgy hands are your family thing. Charles has podgy hands. You have your podgy dirty fingers around that girls waist drew. / []
Do sweating??? Do... yoh..white folks are different we..do you DO breathing?? yaaal???Do you Do / []
What were you doing in Trump if you dont drink, dance and bang women of the night?? What??? What?? / []
Had to??? Mmmm.. / []
No i don't regret my friendship by him or cause of him it was a whole whole lot of bloody fun / []
Even if it were true, 3 times a year is alot especially for a "royal" as you lot refer to them. That's every quarter.  If you were happily married why the hell did you get a divorce Andrew? / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Those 3 times a year were devastating to your victims / []
if he was joe bloggs, andy would be in jail, if the royals ok with this, we should scrap the royal family / []
jimmie savillie / []
He’s too stupid to lie convincingly and stood no chance against Emily Maitlis who was very organised with facts and dates and so very superior to him in intellect. Had he been more self-aware, he would never have agreed to the interview. / []
His best move would have been to lambast Epstein and Maxwell, across the board. The second thing would have been to lean on the idea that both Epstein and Maxwell were calculated in blackmail, so they took any opportunity to get material on powerful people. He then would say, "Yes, I met that woman once and we did take a picture together. We all went out to dinner, went to the night club, there were a lot of people with us, including her. I didn't think much of it... I didn't think she was underaged because she got into the club. I just assumed everyone with us was of age. I didn't think anything of it. At one point, she asked for a picture and we took it. I left shortly after. In hindsight, I do think Jeffery took that picture for blackmail purposes. Same with the pictures in the park. As far as her allegations against me, those things never happened. I don't know if it's Epstein and Maxwell brainwashing her or convinced her it happened, but it didn't. I understand that she suffered long-term trauma with what she went through, so I'm convinced that Epstein and Maxwell, as part of their blackmailing, convinced her, probably over years, that we had relations when we didn't." I think I would even add in that Epstein at some point threatened me with that picture and said Virginia will make statements... / ["That would have been a masterful explanation. However, Virginia said there were two other times she was trafficked to Andrew and there are witnesses that said they saw Andrew and Virginia together in New York and the Virgin Islands. So he couldn't have explained they met just once.", "@conversegirl1011 I wonder if he could have said others did see them, maybe multiple times, just as they were with a crowd at Tramp night club, but he wasn't with her, but rather she was with him, Epstein, Maxwell, and all kinds of other people. Just muddy the water like, yeah, I saw her a few times, she was just in the mix of people... I wasn't there to see her or vice versa... either way, he was doomed. No one is believing any excuse. We all know what he did, but if you're going to lie, come up with a good one, even if no one believes it."]
Da ist ja Münchhausen nichts dagegen!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
this interview is hilarious / []
it took 6 years to bring him down. Good Job Emily. You didn't l interrupt him when he was digging his own grave / []
I don't get it - who cares Abt all those non significant details - the only thing that matters is IF he knew there were any sex trafficking / underaged sexual relations going on there  If I'm friends with Ted Bundy - it doesn't mean I no he's a serial killer -& even  less a part of it  It Shud be "Innocent until proven guilty" / ['Is that you Andy?', 'Hint. All the nonspecific details also means waffle. As in with each word that left that man’s mouth, he solidified his guilt. A lawyer would NEVER allow this']
"... there are a number of things that are wrong with that story. One of which is that I don't know where this err bar is Tramps, uhhmm, argh I don't drink, erhhm I don't think that I've ever bought a drink in Tramps err whenever I was there..." / []
The poor guy was "shot at" during the Falklands conflict and left with the inability to sweat; how terrible! A truly awful example of the Human cost of War... Simon Weston got off lightly, the Lucky bugger!! / []
He only talking to clear his name. Because he was once his friend doing what he doing knowing he knows he is apart of it. He just trying to cover his tracks now it’s all in the open. A guy always look out for his “brother or Hisself”. / []
An eejit, personified. / []
Andrew is as guilty as sin, no one i have talked to said, they would pay out 12 million pounds, to someone they have never met. The man is a total lair, that poor girl going through what she has over the years, and here is the man that bedded, her at 17 years old, in America that is Illegal to sleep with a minor. Andrew is a disgrace to Britain and the patriot British indigenous Christian citizens, he should be vanished out of Britain never to return. / []
He is such a liar lol / []
He couldn’t have performed any worse just a terrible performance / []
OMG the brits suck at lying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,  bra why get up there,,,,,,,,, mans said I had to fly to see him . It was the chickens way 🤦🏾😫🤣🤣🤣 / []
Why don’t you guys smoke more marijuana openly / []
He is so confident because of his money, title, so disgusting ! Same as Trump hiding  the files… 🤮🤮🤮 / []
Andrew,,,I never met Virginia ,,,,I never had sex with her ,,,,I have no recollection of being in a photograph with her,,,,,so I paid her 12 million pounds  compensation for not doing anything to her,,,, this makes sense Andrew!! GUILTY ,,,,what a disgrace !! / []
He never outright condemned Epstein. The now ex Prince grasping at straws in a futile attempt in damage limitation. / []
11:28 Oops, looks like someone is stumbling their words. / []
Why should he explain his movements to you peasant’s , your not royalty and he is , he’s done nothing but been tricked into a friendship with Epstein and his team to sell prince Andrew sexual favourers and the bragging rights for Epstein and his girlfriend to say they are friends of royalty , paying for sex is as old as time , it’s NOT a crime , different matter if he himself picked up young women and had sex , but even that is debatable if you make that a crime you better put the whole world in Jail .🤬🤷‍♂️🇦🇺🤔🤔🤔🤔 / ['Is that you Andrew', "Your grammar and punctuation are both horrible, so I'm not sure many will be taking your opinions to heart.", 'It appears you have been caught paying for sex in the past and been outcast for it. Now, this has triggered you. I bet you have a picture of Andy boy in your flat somewhere, my fellow peasant.', '@swimthestyx thank you for your obvious annoyance with my factual comments , you are blinded by your lack of knowledge on the matter and are only interested in seeing blood , Andrew is a billionaire several times over , his family , the royals own half England as well as billions too , this will backfire on a lot of people when they are sued for defamation , it’s not a crime to pay for sex or mix with certain people , no matter who you are or how old ,if you accept money for sex you are a prostitute .😎🤠💸💸💸💸💸💸😃', '@sararossborough5363thank you darling 💓💓💜💜💜']

I can only admire Emily's courage here, given the conspiracy theories around Epstein's suicide. This is exactly the kind of fearless journalism that this age needs.

The telling thing about this interview is how completely out of touch he is with the real world. He thinks that whatever he says is gospel simply because he was the queen's son. People like him deserve to be studied. / []
I believe every word he says 😂🤣 / []
Randy nailed this / []
2025. This interview is wild. / []
f*****g hysterical / []
There's a whole lot of things you face now that you didn't 25 years ago, it's called ' the music ' / []
I bet he's made up for all that lack of sweating since .😅 / []
Talk about fumbing the💰😐 / []
What a bumbling fool, this never gets old 😅 / []
He should be in Prison. Any normal person would never ever socialise with a sex offender, it would never never ever be just convenient to stay with one!!  "epstein must have changed his behaviour, when I stayed with him"  and he really thinks we are going to accept that?.....This Guy is a Headcase!! / []
So i went to break it up and left next day. No you stayed for several days. You had a party? No just a small dinner. With a foot massage? No, i dont have feet. / []
For someone who has never been cornered and pushed around....has has proved to be a very dangerous Person 🤔🤔🤔🤔 / []
Mega sweaters batman, / []
Liar liar / []
Nobody's Girl will haunt you from the grave...RIP Virginia. xx / []
As a professor in phycology...i see him very guiltily and a sexul predator / []
Buffffffff... / []
Woff woff 😂 dumb as a rock on BBC 😂 he looks like his mothers eyes 😊 / []
If your a man you have to take some positive action to have sex with someone.. Yep he took some positive action, he had sex with Virginia at Maxwell's house in London. / []
I'll tell you the only possible reason why he wouldn't sweat if that was even true. He's a psychopath, he doesn't feel so why would he pespire. He doesn't feel fear or guilt or shame or remorse / []
What a dirty b******. I bet he had pineapple on his pizza at Pizza Express. / ['😂😂😂']
After the disclosure of these emails, yet more proof that he sat there and lied to her face and the British public. Time has made this interview even more car crash / []
So it's fine for a lying representative of thousands of years of opression of the British people and a pedophile to own guns for shooting weekends but not us. He's dead behind the eyes, there's nothing there / []
He wasn't a close friend but just HAD to visit him to tell him he cant see him anymore..... / []
13.40 "Another guest was there,  Literary agent, JOHN BROCKMAN,  (Queue the absolute shock horror as Andrew leans in with eyes wide open then eyes darting to his left subconsciously confirming that there is a camera watching him, and checking the exit at he same time) he knew that John Brockman has seen him getting a massage from a young girl but had forgotten about it until Emily blindsided him and brought it up (Not for one minute did he think his old pal John Brocckman would throw him under the bus.) Andrew replied vehemently, "REALLY? his reaction  was as though everyone watching (including Emily) would join him in he shock of this man actually being there. literally 15 seconds later Emily asked Andrew "Is Mr Bockman's statement false? Andrew said,  "I don't know Mr Brockman, so I don't know what he is talking about!  Hang on a minute Andrew.. 15 seconds ago your face was doing somersaults when she simply told you John Brockman was also there, and you asked her if he REALLY was there. At that point if you had no Idea who John Brockman was, or as you say "You don't know the man" ...why didn't you ask her immediately who is John Brockman? instead of the dramatic "REALLY"..   You've been caught bang to rights with your pants down. / []
I am  100% sure that Andrew is lying / []
Twin  tower fuc gross 😮😮🎉 / []
BS cough cough ahem BS / []
Whats done in the dark, will be brought to the light...and so it has. / []
There all as bad as each other get rid of the royal family / []
You're an attractive young Thai escort, with a rising reputation among Bangkok's pervy elite, but even to you, the Oriental Hotel oozes luxury. The concierge takes you and 2 friends up to the main suite in the service lift. You're nervous as you always are at these time. What's the client going to be like? Kind? Old? Nasty, with sick tastes or are they just seeking a massage? Well, once you get into the room, that looks out over the mighty Chao Phraya river, you see a sight that you'll never forget. It's handsome prince Andy and 35 other girls and ladyboys and he's doing his damndest to satisfy everyone. He moves from fanny to mouth, to arse and back with all the precision of a military exercise, pausing only to swig Singha beer and check everyone is having fun. You can't wait for your turn with this handsome English prince. / []
Just picture this! You're a young lady, a black ebony princess in the prime of your young life. You're at Tramps nightclub, the posho's club of choice. Suddenly, the revelers on the dancefloor part and you see him. It's Andy and he moves across the club like a jungle cat, sensual and sure of himself. Your eyes meet and he swoops over to you like he was floating on air. A couple of clicks and he's brought a waiter over and is offering you a drink....you're having Tia Maria of course. What a night you're in for. He makes love like he dances. Sex is all in the hips for sex master Andy. What a night you'd have. / []
Apologise? You must be joking I was at a Pizza Express in Woking And I already gave 12 million quid  To a girl I never met, for something I never did  Breaking up with Jeffrey would have been intolerable  Besides, I’m just too honourable  You lowly peasants just don’t get it  When you’re a Prince, you just don’t sweat it (Because I have, or had, a medical condition - yes, that’s right - I didn’t sweat I mean I couldn’t sweat at the time. Because I was shot at) / []
Einstein has invited you to his lovely home and given you the best guest room. It's late and the city that never sleeps is winding down. You feel a bit naughty and decide to have a little fun. No problem, everyone does it. As your fingers move down your body, and your thoughts turn erotic there's a slight knock at the door....it's Andy! He peers round the door with a cheeky grin on his face. "Perhaps I can lend a hand" he suggests in his Royal accent. Wow, you're in for a real treat and a night of fun. He's a real cocksmith! Perhaps England's best. / []
After watching 'Epstein Filthy Rich' on Netflix, and knowing about those emails 'play again soon'- I know now he is 100% lying. I was pretty sure before, but the other evidence sealed the deal for me. He knew everything, and did nothing. Shame on him. / []
imagine you're a young lady having a lovely relaxing weekend at Epstein's and you're reading a book. Suddenly a shadow falls over the page, a big shadow. It's Andy's rigid member. you look up and Andy is grinning, he's ready for action. Who's a lucky girl / []
Imagine feeling the most intense sexual pleasure of your life and you look down and Andy is there, eating your muff! His face is red and his tongue and lips are going at you like crazy. you're a lucky girl. / []
Picture this. Andy is doing you from behind and you're loving it. Suddenly there's a feeling of heat on your back. You turn your head and see Andy is eating a lovely bowl of French onion soup and is resting the bowl on your back. He spoons the soup in, grinning as he thrusts away with the royal member.  What a guy!! / []
Imagine being the girl lucky enough to catch Andy's eye. later that evening he's pleasuring you like no commoner ever could, working you over like a sophisticated sex machine. What a night that would be. / []
imagine seeing Andrew reverse cowboying a lass, his royal tackle thrusting in while his kingly orbs slap up and down. What a sight that must be. / []
Imagine walking in on Andrew while he's on the job - his strangely pale buttocks glowing in the moonlight thrusting up and down so fast it's like a blur. Then you hear him mutter "Oh Gosh". / []
I don't like the fella but I bet he goes like a well-oiled piston. / ['You are sick']
Liar liar pants on fire. What a creepy liar he is! / []
Anyone else notice the micro-movements of him almost undressing Emily with his eyes - why his eyes keeps darting there?? Is it the half-buttoned top? Great pre-planning. Look at 12:10.... sunk! Emily did an unbelievable job. / []
What a LIAR! / []
Virginia Giuffre’s book has sealed the deal. Andrew will either be convicted of pedophilia and sent to prison or he will be an outcast for the rest of his life. / []
What a monster / []
the whole ROYAL Family in Britain is a DISGRACE! Just a shameless welfare recipient out of taxpayers' money and being just GARBAGE ! / ['The whole Royal Family? A disgrace? Garbage? I think that Prince William and Kate are quite alright. So are Prince Edward and Sophie. And I think Princess Anne is doing great work. And so was the now deceased Duchess of Kent.\nI think your comment says more about you than it says about the Royal Family.']
Don't interrupt the interviewer and say your a member of the British Royal Family!   For a start your certainly not a member of the royal family. You were secretly meeting up with a sex offender,  and have serious allegations against you. You have disgraced King Charles along with Queen Camilla,  not forgetting Prince William  and Princess Kate.   your daughters. The truth is revealed and you don't like it very much. your not entitled anymore. stripped clean here here. / []
you live by the sword you die by the sword. end of / []
you made your bed...go lie in it... / []
I don’t think it’s fair to call him the party prince when all of us have done worse in our teen and 20’s! / ['Andrew is that you']
Y Al are a bh of wks / []
The fact that he never says “it’s horrifying that I would ever be accused with having sex with a minor, I would NEVER do such a thing” OR “I was appalled to find out about Epstein, his actions were absolutely disgusting” OR “I feel so sorry for the victims” speaks VOLUMES on its own. / []
Oxygen thief / []
I bet he's sweating now! / []
who thinks andy is telling the truth 😁😁😁😁 / []
Anyone here watching this in November 2025 🙋‍♂️ / []
Evil in person / []
Not allowed to create mment😂 / []
O MALABARISTA  CAI, QUANDO ELE  ACHA  QUE  PODE  VOAR. / []
Pure liar / []
denial,lies guilt / []
He will never take full responsibility of his decisions because he wasn' t taught to do so😢 What a shame!!! / []
Wild that this is 5 years old, I remember watching it live / []
OMG / []
Well we will probably never know ! I’m sure he was up to no good, however One of the men she said she had sex with was untrue and she had to admit that she got it wrong , so i do not believe all that she said . She said  I now recognise I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr Dershowitz". So you cannot believe all that she said . / ['🎉😂 Andrew is that you']
'No, it was a shooting weekend' with exactly the same look on his face as my 10 year old when I ask him if he's got homework. / []
This man is a compulsive liar, he’s caused the deaths of that poor girl yet still refuses to admit being with her. He’s got what he deserves,but it hasn’t finished yet because rightly so the Americans are now gunning for him . / []
We are lucky the royals havnt been so keen to hang draw and quarter as the public and media have been with the royal family / []
Funny stuff. / []
A few more massages before ending the friendship 🤣🤣🤣 / []
So guilty / []
He thinks he's real smart doing this but he couldn't og done a dumber thing than to give this interview. He didn't listen to his lawyers advice it is more than apparent. / []
This didn’t age well 😂 / []
This is fascinating with 5 years hindsight / []
I, for one, believe Randy Andy Windsor, the ex-Royal formerly known as Prince.🤣🤣🤣 / []
Why the hell would you even do this or any interview?! This man is the absolute pinnacle of arrogance personified.   How the mighty do fall. / []
Emily Maitlis’ David Frost moment. / []
His beginning of the end. / []
'I have a peculiar medical condition" - how incredibly convenient. / []
Rather amusing to watch this long after the fact.....lol / []
Andrew didn't say that they couldn't be together after PB, he said that they couldn't be seen together. There is a big difference. / []
Apologise? You must be joking I was at a Pizza Express in Woking And I already gave 12 million quid  To a girl I never met, for something I never did  Breaking up with Jeffrey would have been intolerable  Besides, I’m just too honourable  You lowly peasants just don’t get it  Men like us, we just don’t sweat it / []
One of the most excellent interviews ever, total respect for Maitlis, her background preparation is astounding in exposing him / ["It didn't take much 😂 to expose him. He did that himself."]
The most shocking thing about this interview is that he knows what a Pizza Express is. / []
13:50 peak / []
Patron of nsppc full stop ffs 🙄  Big fish, small fish swinging in the water,  hey man give me back my daugher...go back to the light clean 😐 / []
This interview needs studying for the way it made monumental mess of this idiots life 😂😂😂 / []
Poor Andrew targeted and lost the case, pple in the world target the British Royal family for many years, if Queen Elizabeth was alive this would not be happening. / []
He humiliated his parents before they died. A retribution for tearing Palestine up. And he humiliated them in the hands of Zionists. / []
The reason why he "stayed" with a convicted sex offender clearly can only be for one reason - he was freaking out what could be on himself after that and wanted to make sure Epstein didnt spill the beans. why else would a royalty choose to visit a convicted sex offender which is obviously horribly for your publicity? It make zero sense. / []
Andrew stayed at a known sex offender’s house after conviction! that says all you need to know about his morals. / []
The women knew what they were doing why blame the men, they just wanted the money and attention / ['Except they were as young as 13', 'Is that you Andrew']
How strange that everyone forgets that Prince Andrew fought for his country during the Falklands war / ['Is that you Andrew?']
Oh please what discusting  liar   etc I feel sorry for his daughters and grandchildren / []
"I dont know where the club tramp is" Also "I dont think i ever once bought a drink at tramp whenever i was there"   ? / []
If they don't care why should we? / ['Andrew is that you']
Put that horrific dirtbag sicko in prison disgusting man / []
You are a liar.. Watching your body language isn't very convincing...don't bullshit about being in Navy and you're adjusting you're body.. / []
Emily Maitlis conducts a great interview, allowing Andrew to speak fully, and thereby completely outwitting him. The blundering Andrew walks into a bear-trap, gives ridiculous reasons and justifications for his actions, and is literally "hoist by his own petard." And of course, from Andrew, not an ounce of contrition. / []
He had a special way of bringing people together.  Yes, when you’re serving young girls I’m sure cosmopolitan people like politicians would love to come together.  This interview proves his guilty.  Not just what he said but he’s body language tells so much. / []
This is great.... much better than a cross examination in court. Beautifully done by Ms. Emili Maitlis..... Absolutely fearless, brave and amazing. / []
I WOULD MAYBE SEE HIM 3 TIMES A YEAR ... IN A DEPOSITION HE STATED HE'D SEEN YOU 4 TIMES THAT YEAR... 4 TIMES!!! 😂😂😂 / []
I WASN'T REALLY FRIENDS WITH EPSTEIN I WAS MORE FRIENDS WITH GISLAIN UMMM SIR SHE'S A PREDOPHILE TOO...... UM UM UM / []
HERE 5 YEARS LATER TO SAY THAT VIRGINIA IS NOW DEAD TOO OH YEAH IT WAS A SUICIDE 😢 ALSO THE 9 COPS WHO SEEN THE TAPES / []
Horrible liar and absurd excuses! What a stain on the Royal family. It just further proves their hypocrisy / []
Does he normally stutter? / []
Okay so let me get this straight just to be clear Trump administration nobody did any crimes. BBC News look at these crimes / []
People are making a big deal over something trivial.  Andrey paid for consensual sex with a female who was of the legal age for sex in the United Kingdom.   How many other adult men have gone to prison in England for having sex with a consenting seventeen year old?  The Americans want to extradite Andrew to USA for breaking one of their laws in England.  This is similar to Britain extraditing Finsbury Park Mosque Imam Abu Hamza to USA for breaking an American law in England. / ['Is that you Andrew', 'He was involved with  child trafficking peadophiles. Grow up', 'Judging by that pig ugly profile picture, I am guessing that the only sex you get is sex you pay for.']
How he can lie with a straight face! / []
Prince Andrew talks like a normal bloke, most royalty put on a posh voice to appear more upper class / ['Is that you Andrew']
You can tell the interviewer hates him from the first minute lol / ['Is that you Andrew']
Predator  - Friends with Gerlaine not Epstein that’s even worse Release the files now !!! HRH. No more! / []
Best mates with the favourite daughter of a crook who robbed millions from the Mirror Group pension funds. Didn’t he think for one moment that might not be advisable for a member of the Royal Family? Not to mention the fact that she was  procuring underage girls for a paedophile. Arrogant over-privileged fool. / []
National treasure. / []
You horrible greasy sweaty slithering lying snake - I wish him nothing but misery for the rest of his days / []
40:33 his blasé chuckling reaction to “Epstein in now dead”. …. He knows Epstein is living on some island somewhere having faked his death. / ["Don't be foolish", "Or he's pleased because Epstein is no longer here to squeal.", '@sararossborough5363foolish…..what, how a billionaire linked to the worlds most powerful people could fake his death. Maybe you are the foolish one.', '@UnIimited_Poweryes, or it could be a chuckle knowing he was done away with. His ‘Suicide’ and Virginia Giuffre ‘Suicide’ are highly suspect when the most powerful and wealthy individuals are involved.', "\u200b@SimonWillcockAntiques😂 we are talking about the royal family here people die left right and centre around them. You're not the brightest are you."]
I’ve just stumbled upon this and I have to say, no one could possibly watch this and come away thinking that he’s not involved. Nothing he said had any kind of believable substance or outrage that he was being accused of this. / []
A liar always speaks too much . When they know they been bought out / []
I have watched this at least five times since it was aired, and I have never been able feel that I am hearing one answer that feels true. He lies in literally every single answer. He is caught out by so many of Maitlis' simple questions and statements, and he is terrible at lying on the spot. His scripted answers are even worse.  I don't know where the bar is, I was unable to sweat, Pizza Express in Woking, having sex is a positive act, the photo is doctored.   The pure disrespect for Virginia Giuffre is disgusting. Virginia Giuffre was picked up by Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago and trafficked from there. Trump wrote sick love letters to Epstein also, about them playing together.   Trump is a slightly better liar than Prince Andrew. Well, he shouts louder. Trump cannot run and hide from what he did at Epstein's house and island forever. / []
He should have come straight out with it and said ' I have reason to believe I've been fitted up ' but he's old school and too much of a gentleman / ['Is that you Andrew']
He does have a thick skin to ignore these spiteful comments from your thick commenters and the paperazzi referring to him as bovine he supposedly visited Epstein 4 times a year according to the housekeeper who was paid off to say that no actor could have faked his victor meldrew like response to maitlis 's accusation ' response " 4 times a year !!!!!! I don't believe it " / ['Is that you Andrew']
You can't blame him for playing the field after fergie started going to seed and was giving him sex / ['Is that you Andrew']
Why should he go to prison numbnuts ? He has never gone to court and been convicted most of what people are saying is made up the Russian girl giving him a foot massage was probably kgb and Andrew working for royal navy intelligence was pumping her ( for information ) which he can't discuss as he is still sworn  to the official secrets act it wouldn't surprise me if that was a doctored photo like lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle in his backyard , possibly by the cia or mossad / ['Is that you Andrew']
This is so gross. / []
He completely screwed himself by saying he didn't regret his friendship with JE.  💚 O+ / []
Epstein  had the most extraordinary ability to bring paedophiles together, which is more of an alleged fact Andrew / []
This reporter is 🔥 / []
27:40: when she mentions the words 'sex with her', Andrew looks down and blinks and that is proof he did it. / []
He is soooooo funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
" sweating like a rapist" / []
My heart goes out to these young ladies I keep thinking of when I was 14 innocent lord have mercy. / []
No because you’ll are caught. God is so good. / []
He is swallowing so hard. First sign of lies. Why you had to go see him. Oh please. / []
He went to see him to find out what he said about his noncing royal arse to the law , keeping in his good books so he don't drop him in it , fckin sweaty pios prick / []
Don't believe one word he's saying / []
" Bring extraordinary people together" so they can shag who they like without  repercussions / []
Excellent example of just how very out of touch the ruling class (as well as their handlers) are with average people! I don’t think Prince Andrew believes he did anything wrong, and as bizarre as many of his remarks were, I think he honestly believed in his mind that he did nothing wrong. That’s what comes from being insulted and privileged all your life.  His PR people absolutely should have prepped him WAY MORE than they did! He never admonished Epstein, Maxwell, or any of those who participated in the sexual abuse that was regularly perpetrated on these young ladies! The fact that he expressed ZERO Concern, Outrage, or Sympathy for the victims was the most shocking and unforgivable part of this whole affair.  After all, he has 2 daughters of his own.   Considering all the charity and foundations he is involved in, he should have announced that he had already established one of them for the Survivors of Sexual Abuse and Trafficking to help not only the victims of Epstein, but of any other victims struggling to get their lives back together.   Shame on him and all of the other perpetrators! / []
Dont sweat it Andrew! 💧 😅 / []
"I've  never been upstairs" but "this photgraph was taken upstairs". / []
On what planet is it "honourable" to stay at the home of a convicted sex offender? / ['Or “Convenient”??? 🙄']
He thinks we're stupid IMO he's taking advantage of us ALL in the UK GIVING OUR TAX to support his activities how dare he IMO it makes me sick / []
A pervert of note / []
Epstein was a creation of Mosaad / []
And HE was the Queen’s favorite??😮 / ['And Trusted His Judgment!!! 😂🤨']
It’s like a job interview 😂😂😂 / []
My favourite animal is a ‘royal’ in a desperate situation. Vive la Republique🥂 / []
This guy should be in jail! / []
What a buffoon. Are all of these useless "global elites" quite as handicapped. / ['ABSOLUTELY!!! They are COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH!! \n“It wasn’t a party, it was just a small dinner  for 8-10 people…”😳 “Just a straight up shooting weekend, nothing more.” “I don’t even know where the bar is.” I guess he’s never heard of Cocktail Waitresses either in his castle in the sky!! 🙄🤥\nThis is the result of immense wealth, privilege, and power! Useless self centered people.']
Wat een kneus🤮 / []
Jail time ..... and next shall be the king's investigation on Diana and Doddi's assassination this is Nov 2025 for history / []
He keeps saying he doesn't remember as opposed to, I didn't do it. / ['GUILTY!', 'Very hard for him to remember whether he had sex with a 17 year old girl in the early 2000s, but thankfully he recalled spending the alleged day with his kids at some kids birthday party 😂😂🎂']
He stood by his pal , that was dragged / []
Like. Jfk , hes a lose end , / []
Ok., in court of love ❤️  hes  guilty as hell,  pay my pal £1 / []
A gold digging call girl and feminist media VS a royal war hero. I know what I believe! / []
'' If you are a man'' what a disgusting statement. Is he saying that as a woman, the intirmacy. is any less memorable?  Or, in this case, a horrifying, awful nightmare. / []
Forget losing his titles, I just hope he doesn't lose his membership with Pizza Express... / []
You just have to take one look at him to see the utter arrogance oozing out of him!. / []
If Jeffrey Epstein was no more than a “plus one” to an acquaintance (Ghislaine Maxwell) of his (Prince Andrew) then why would he need to worry talking to him in person to end their friendship? 🙄 / ['More to the point, couldn’t they have just met for lunch or drinks to have their discussion??? There was absolutely no justification for him staying at his home for several days!! Even if “it was convenient!” 🙄🤢 As if PRINCE 🤴🏻 Andrew Can’t Afford to stay at the very best and Most Convenient Hotel in all of NYC?!?! 🤥😏🤯🤥']
"I've never felt the need to party"  "Just a straightforward shooting weekend"  "There was Absolutely no indication....and if there was..."  To Epstein "Look, because of what's happened (sex trafficking) I don't think it's appropriate that we should remain in contact. And by mutual agreement ...we decided we would part company..." / []
Masterclass in interview skills. Watching a true liar in action is laughable 😂😂😂😂 / []
Is there no responsibility on the girl tho. / ['She was a young girl ffs abused at a young age by her father then groomed, trafficked and passed around rich powerful men for their use.', "She's now DEAD"]
He’s a peasant now.  Got kicked out of his palace by his brother  stripped of his title and now he’s a common man.   We need this journalist to interview trump well done 👍 / []
What a horrible human being. / []
It’s remarkable Andrew Windsor’s team and the Crown let him conduct this interview thinking he could actually achieve damage control. His hubris is hilariously humiliating. / ['I suspect his advisors are cut from the same cloth. Arrogant, privileged, not half as intelligent as they think they are.', '\u200b@jon780249I bet they all thought it was a bad idea ...\n\nBut Andrew lives in his own reality']
Someone said they remember him breathing heavily, Andrew said that’s impossible because ‘I don’t have any Lungs’. / []
❗️My Timestamps:  2:01 These people will be on the Epstein List. / ['A cosmopolitan group🤣🤣🤣🤣']
lol, lmao / []
16:43 brother you should regret that friendship / []
Mommy ....tell them to believe my nonsense lies 😂😂 ..... And give me millions out of the hard working tax payers  !!!   Like any other royal, they think if we can't see them, then its ok to lie and take millions or be corrupt and ra*pe . Then They leave the country to collapse?! / []
Cringe level infinity ♾️ unlocked / []
What a liar.  At 9.30 he is the best / []
but.....but.....but..........but  - such a scum and bad liar! arrest him! / []
This guy is a disgrace, a criminal, and a pathetic liar! He belongs in prison for raping American children! / []
The struggle for him to keep up with his own storylines is pretty plain to see, the "I didn't know" nonsense is the tell, his body language speaks volumes / []
I went to see Epstein - and told him we could not be seen together - so I took a WALK IN THE PARK with him to tell him???????? This guy is a child / rapist and a joke! He belongs in prison! / ['AND then STAYED as a Guest in HIS HOME for SEVERAL DAYS….because he can’t afford to stay in a “convenient” hotel!!! 🤥🤥🤥🤥']
Lie detector please / ['He’s being interviewed by a lie detector lol a master class in interviewing has shown the repulsive, creepy ,lying person he is']
Liar.    Liar / []
Reall6 no public displays of affection ..we all remember the toe sucking pics how you know it was upstairs??? Stinks me thinks .now she dead !!!! / []
I'm glad he spoke / []
I will probably disappear now. / []
,no i dtrongly deny it.  You sweatging bullets if thats true   How  many soldiers have ever said that. No recollection. / []
I am an ordinary person and when I worked n a day centre a l8nch club for homeless and people on low income ..prince Charles was visiting and we were all checked out ,anyone who was to meet chase was checked out by the police ...so I have no doubt anyone near Andrew or the royal would be checked ...unless they decided otherwise. !× break up relationship?? That you say you didn't have ...think maxwell had a lot to do with it ..randy Andy strikes again ..was like a railway station why would you stay t if lots of unknown people coming and going ...surely he is more aware of security than that / []
He occupies a very interesting place in the history of lies, sex and video tapes. / []
Liar !,,,,,,,,,, / []
I wonder how he used NSPPC Full Stop to traffic little girls and young ladies? How did he use his power in that organization to help Jeffry Epstein. Has anyone investigated? / ['Exactly it was probably a grooming station or where they cherry picked vulnerable children to traffick']
what a liar / []
LIAR !! / []
40:37 "Epstein is dead".... Andrew: 😅 yes (laughs) / []
Master class in guilty body language.  Unbelievable how bad he looks. Guilty! / []
He doesn't know where the bar is in tramp nightclub, he doesn't sweat, he says it was a convenient place to stay, and he says he has no recollection of meeting Virginia, he doesn't drink and he never bought a drink in tramp😂, also he was at pizza express in Woking. looooool . How disgraceful.He also has no memory of the photo. His friend states it's been faked😂. Now Virginia is dead, who killed her😮 / []
Ok, not a behavioral analyst or anything, but I’d actually think a lot of this was truthful, up until he says he doesn’t know how Epstein died oddly enough. / ['And now Virginia is dead', 'No you’re not a behavioural analyst hence the reason you have made this ridiculous comment ffs.He comes across as an arrogant, nasty, uncaring, reptilian creature,huffing and puffing at every question he is asked. The lines he has rehearsed being dismantled by a master interviewer']
Give him a lie detector test 😂 / []
god dam andrew soo funny / []
Is lord Porchester Andrews father? Porchie / []
Such a liar! / []
13:44 lol look at Andrew's face / []
The email from Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein, where he expressed a desire to "catch up in person" and mentioned that "we're in this together," was sent on December 6, 2011. This email was sent just a day after a photograph of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers, and Ghislaine Maxwell was widely circulated. / []
14:59 and 16:08 Emily actually tried to help him in this interview but Andrew lied so much it was impossible to help this man, digging his own grave. / []
Who killed Virginia and Epstein? / []
gaslighting / []
I maybe wrong, but it'll serve Andrew Mountbatten Windsor right if he's forced to testify before the US Congress about Jeffrey Epstein. And, I wouldn't mind if U.S. Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is called upon to question him too. His "interview" would be MILD compared to the questions Jon. Jasmine Crockett would have! / []
This is so bad / []
He's fencing, lying effectively is an art, you have to believe the lie yourself and keep it succinct and simple. He is an idiot because there is no way the hooker could have proved any of her allegations. / []
12:44 ..."....have a tendency to be too honourable " 😂😂😂😂 / []
Anyone here in 2025? The only difference between Andrew and Trump is that one is a prince that hasn’t spent enough time with normal people to learn how to lie to them. / []
8 to 10 people party to celebrate him getting out sick mofo honorable with his pal epstein / []
The more you watch this rat you no hes guilty sik twisted rodent needs to be arrested / []
Lord Lucan all over again 😂 / []
The 'Belgravia' mafia!...just ask the MET!....coppers will tell you they are untouchable. / []
What the hell is "positive action " / []
Does Andrew and Charles have the same father? They don't look alike. / ['Andrew looks like lord Porchester.', '\u200b@sararossborough5363who is that?']
5h:30s       That alarm in his left breast pocket! / []
Arrogant  man. / ['What is that device in his left breast pocket? - put it this way it went wild at 5m:30s']
He doesn’t mention the victims or condemning the crime. / []
Who’s here in Nov ‘25 , after he was just stripped of everything?🤷🏽‍♂️🫣 / ['me it is brilliant, just watching this video for a laugh', 'Can you believe it took five years? My gosh', 'Better late than never.  Thank you, King Charles.', 'He dont know what they were doing there ..haha .laughing at his own stupidity']
going to dinner parties with all the children and no mummy’s and daddy’s / []
you can tell when he’s lying, it’s when his lips are moving / []
105% preditor. Child molestor, he only thinks heis better bc he is not a gay child molestor like donald trump / []
I know he’s lying…his lips are moving. This idiot is digging a hole and he is  asking for more shovel’s.He should be in handcuffs. He sure looks like Porchy. / ['You mean lord Porchester.?']
20:55 -21-20. I feel like punching him in the face! / []
Woow look at the views 😮 incredible ! / []
21:35-37 There's a slight problem  with   with  with   with   with  the sweating! / []
No you guys don’t get it. Andrew HAD to stay at Jeffrey’s NY mansion for several days despite breaking up the relationship because there is SIMPLY NO alternative place to stay for a few days in NEW YORK CITY / ['And it’s SO VERY “CONVENIENT!”  And of course he couldn’t possibly AFFORD to stay in a “Convenient” Hotel…especially if they don’t provide round the clock Complimentary Underaged Attractive Sex Slaves!!! 😡🤬🤯']
21: 31 Reptilian micro expression. 🦎🦎 / []
Epstein had this guy by the balls / []
Idiot / []
If any proposing this is the Queens fault should see this interview. Poor judgement? Using women? He had all means available as the other and still choose this. This is him. He decided. Andrew Lownie victimize him. He is no victim. He is responsible. / []
We pray for Virginia. R.I.P..... Hope you are be able to laugh with us, hope you are well  in the other side of the world. Those funny comments just showing we are on your side. / []
His flaw is that he is too honorable?? Really?!?!?! / ['Just unbelievable to say it.', '@Dawningx he lives in a privileged  glass house, he has no clue and no one   ever told him how fragile that house is.', '@sew_gal7340 he had no clue how to behave in towards women? That Epstein was a pedofile and associate with someone like that would be bad for the royal family and the monarchy. This is house where the name, appearance and social norms and statues are a virtue and he didn’t know? Victimize him all you want. He is a grown man. He knew exactly what he was doing, he simply didn’t care.', '@sew_gal7340I think I understand what you getting at. But still he knew.']
I can clearly see the lies through his eyes teeth and face 😂 / []
I wasn’t good friends with him, but I had to fly to New York to tell him / []
"Honourable" This prick? Come on / []
Prison, though I doubt it will happen.....  "The system" cannot allow it to go that far. But if it were you or me, it would be different 😉 / []
My absolute fav is "People might believe that this photograph has never been taken as it was taken upstairs and I have never been upstairs". I have no words how much I love this line. This is a self-mockery on a cosmic level. / []
He's got guilt written all over his face and expressions. Why would you pay off someone Millions you have allegedly never met!!!  Come on Andy!!  😂 / []
😂😂😂😂😂 / []
He's a filthy pervert liar / []
Who told this araehole this was a good idea? / ['King Charles III was smart enough --to NOT think so...']
Profusely sweating because he was on ecstasy lol / []
Just turn your name into a symbol bruh ! / []
The amount of times he must have shouted "fuuuuuuuk!" When regretting doing this interview!!😂😂😂 / []
Total BS when he said "doing it over the phone was the chickens way out. I had to go and see him". They weren't lovers ...he even said he was more friends with Maxwell and that's the only connection he had with Epstein. A simple break-up email would have sufficed OR nothing at all since he claims they "weren't close friends". / []
Tramps doesnt open till 10pm so he had plenty of time to change and go noncing. The sweating made me laugh. Pictures dont lie. He drinks and sweats and nonces young girls / []
Watching this again, it’s like a yearly tradition now 😂. / ['Same here ! It gets better everytime 😂']
13:43 is actually hilarious the way he looks around n says ‘Really?!?!?’ Tryna look like an innocent poodle / []
13.52 he turned into Dougal from Father Ted 😂 / []
How in 1999 when he was 40 was he 'friends' with someone at university!!! / []
He should’ve never done this interview, you can see the lies all over him. / []
I carry on with what I do!! MOVING TO BRIXTON 😅😅😅 / []
Oh the lies and we know he did email Epstein and said when will we play again 😂 oh dear / []
Andrews gaslighting is so off the scale anyone can see right through it., yet he thinks hes done a masterful cover up. Pathetic. / []
Bullshit andrew is caught with his lies / []
Innocent people dont pay out. Innocent people dont relinquish their titles. Innocent people don't try to convince others that theyre innocent. This guy is a pathelogical liar who conveniently struggles with recall. We didnt buy it then and we certainly dont buy it now. / []
😂 "bringing extraordinary people together " .    Yeh / []
😂 work ?.     What work.   Oh u mean ''playtime work '   gotya 😬.... must of been really hard 💪🦴👅🥒 / []
How de he know the photo was taken upstairs??? / []
Liar / []
Looking back, he probably wishes he had just told the truth in this interview and admitted what happened. Then, at least people would have had a shred of respect for him. / ['After the interview he though it went really well. There are reports of him reporting it to the Queen.']
What a farkin loser! Absolutely disgusting, shame on YOU!! / []
Lock him up and throw away the key.. Then go after the others, please... / ['Based on what evidence?', 'They have mounds of evidence', '@wendyvanzyl3064 evidence of what? And if they have it, why hasn’t he been arrested?']
And off to infamy and oblivion he goes, but he’ll always be his own biggest fan 😂 / []
Man his body language lol / []
21:10 the state of that lie 😂😂😂😂 / []
This guy is so devoid of reality and what it means to be responsible for something, that he thought it was a good idea to do this interview.  If anything those that have had some sort of doubt about the victims story, perhaps thinking "she wants money" after watching this interview are convinced this guy is guilty as a sin....and has probably done way worse things than sleeping with a 17 year old / []
Of course randy Andy did not dance with VG at the Tramp Night Club, we all know he dances at Pink Pony Club in west hollywood.... / []
Why is everyone so willing to believe the worst of him, he has had every dignity stripped away and yet nobody has proven anything. I don’t know if he is guilty or not and that is insufficient to destroy a man. He may be guilty but what if he isn’t ? / ['Why would he pay her off if he was squeaky clean?', '\u2060\u200b\u2060@anthonymaddaford8474 He didn’t “pay her off”, it was a settled lawsuit in which he did not admit guilt. That’s not to say he’s not guilty, but the civil settlement is a very common outcome in accusations against very rich and wealthy people for which there is no evidence. \nAnd that’s a pretty important point; to this day, there is not a single piece of evidence against him, no criminal accusation ever filed, and no treason to think he’s guilty apart from the accusations themselves.', 'He lied. There are leaked emails that prove it.']
Masterclass in how to lie..... BADLY. / []
Andrew, has not learned to ‘know thyself’. ‘A shooting weekend’ is his factual correction in an interview before the British public. What a foolish mistake! / []
His body language is very telling / []
The pedophile formally known as Prince. / ['😂🤣😂🤣 THAT was a Great One!! 🙌🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻']
I do NOT believe his feigned ignorance. / []
Be honest,  Judgment day will arrive with God / []
Andrew is a smoke screen covering up the gr4pes inquiry and knifing of Brits & roll out of Digital ID & newer more horrifying definition of hate speech. / ['😂😂😂 melt', 'Rubbish']
I'd like to tell Mr. Windsor that even though this whole affair has been no walk in the park, I wouldn't sweat it! / []

Your fucked.. just admit it / []
Should have just told everyone to F off.  he banged a brass, she was over age and getting paid / []
Now that he’s no longer a royal he can face trial…. / ['He needs the justice that prisoners dish out to paedophiles.']
He’s likely thinking about how he can pull the interviewer. / []
Trying to shoot his shot with whatever dignity he has left / []
No member of the navy would agree to this😂 / []
King Charles has announced that he doesnt recall ever being brothers with Prince Andrew / []
Re watching this 5 years later, knowing what we know know, this interview is honestly just insane. The sheer arrogance he had where he genuinely thought he could lie his way out of the mess he had made tells the public many things. But the biggest one is just how clever he thought he was and how dumb he thought the public was. Which is precisely why he is now plain old Andrew. A old man with no friends left in his corner. His final years will be sad and lonely which is exactly what he deserves. His entire life he believed he was better than the rest, when in actual fact, he was much much worse... I cant rule out criminal charges heading his way, this story isn't over yet. / ['There’s not a single shred of evdience against him presented to the public or, presumably, the police. He’s never been charged with anything and there’s been no evidence.', '\u200b@sly8926melt', 'No innocent man lies that much. And lie he did. Over and over and over. Just because no evidence has been made public at this point, does not mean it does not exist. Hence, watch this space.']
I believe Andrew. Nothing about his testimony seemed off. I think he's innocent. / ['💀', '😂', 'Andrew, is that you?', '\u200b@starry2733lol😂😅']
How does it take 4 days to stay with and end a friendship with someone they barely knew? / []
Disgusting creature! / []
Everything eventually catches up. Everything. / []
So what Andrew is basically saying is...  "Billie Jean, is not my lover. She's just a girl, that claims that I am the one... But the kid is not my son. Oo Oo Oo". / []
Spitting image song about him being a Prince who can't say no in the 80s sums him up / []
Omg.... I've watched this several times but watching it in November 2025 hits differently 😅 / []
Young girls were coming in and out of that house... this pervert knew everything that was going on. Guilt is smeared all over his royal bullshitting face. / []
Anyone here now he’s been found out and ain’t a prince / []
"..the Andrew formally known as prince..!" / []
What a BAREFACED LIAR 😮 / []
His brother’s like Go to prison bro… / []
10:19 the only slightly true sentence he spoke in this interview / []
He's so disconnected from reality, he has no idea how easy it is for all of us to see he's lying in every sentence / []
Hope he gets worse once the files come out. This is only the beginning for Andrew, a normie just like us, with consequences for our actions / ['Yep, he deserves worse. Like testifying before the US Congress.']
U pervert u should be exiled out of the UK all ur army badges taken away publicly told to the people of UK that prince Andrew is no longer aloud into the UK or the royals every one of them king inall should be sacked and no longer UK under royal law and having to honour dirty pigs who let pervert live in a big mansion having security from tax paying people getting driven around like he was the king himself all under the radar the king is harbouring a known pedophile and what does that make him we no he cheated on Diana the princess that was 2 good for the royal family they had her driven mad by paparazzi an finally killed in a tunnel probably by secret service SAS what ever there called the royal family should be relieved of there duty's give them a couple mansions with the millions they have in banks around the world  put crown jewels In a museum and they be forgot about in few years job done better Britain even tho we beat them out of republic of Ireland with the only thing they now violence and bloodshed up the Ra 💣 / []
😂😂😂   fumbling n lying / []
Body Language says it all .... Screams GUILTY as hell. Cock a doodly doo any hole will do  😂😂 😂 / []
May be  andrew Windsor did have sex with her …but thought he wasn’t having sex …so he doesn’t recollect that what he had was sex …😅😅😅😅RIP / []
BULLSHIT!!! Andrew is a piece of garbage  A long with Epstein and trump and maxwell  such a bullshit story and now he deserves no title to his name !!!!! King Charles and William did the right thing by removing his title!! TRUMP ALSO NEEDS TO BE PUNISHED / []
What a load of wtf 😢 / []
U were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender….. Andy: it was a convenient place to stay / []
This is my favourite video on YouTube... i watch it at least twice a year... i love to watch him wriggle and lie his way through it..  getting angry when he's asked questions he can't answer, isn't prepared for the question or knows his answer will look and sound stupid... thinking people would buy his bollocks and he's doing a good job trying to fool everyone... he deserves everything he gets .. He's always been a tosser... / []
Why does he keep stammering. / ['Posh people think it sounds charming']
Not the sharpest tool in the box. / []
Resolve things that are sensible  " I will give You a few miilion!) / []
49:17 Well are you, really? 😂😂 / []
This is an advanced level  bullshitter 😂 / []
Tried and tried to remember🤣🤣🤣 / []
An over priviliged arrogant Man, caught out because of people He thought were below him!! / []
Amazing the way in which he uses the word “we” in response to each question. Almost as if he has a team of people on his side backing him up when in reality the opposite is true. / []
Typical narcissist. / []
The sign on his forehead “liar” is flashing and flickering so dazzling. / []
Without any prepared speeches, an entourage to get him out of trouble or, quite recently, royal titles to bail him out, he crumbles from a being public prince to an incompetent liar. This interview was the tip of the iceberg as we know there have been more lies exposed since with much more to come. It isn't over until Andrew winds up in prison & with all the details still being leaked from The Epstein Files, it will happen one day. How safe do you feel, President Trump? / []
This man makes Henry the V111 look like a saint / []
No offence to our late Queen; as a mother first and foremost, she was undoubtedly protecting the indefensible —her son, Andrew.. / []
Didn’t know the Andrew formerly known as the Prince had a stutter, especially when he lies… what a piece of work / []
The Queen must be flipping in her grave what a mess / ['She created giving her blessings for Andrew to pay 12 million to a woman he had never met its disgusting']
He couldn’t tell the truth if it hit him on the nose / []
Er, um um, er, he couldnt even string a sentence together! / []
I always like to listen to this interview while I'm working / []
Well.... I think that all went really well 😊 / []
Notice Andrew avoiding eye contact😳 / []
Nothing happened but paid her £12m. / []
Omg “my tendency to be too honorable!!! “ / []
Omg 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Omg 😂😂😂😂 such bs / []
Only Andrew Mountbatten Windsor can shake his head vehemently and yet his expression can still somehow be look like damn you got me good on that one / []
The only true statement: I did not think.  Yes, and you never got into the habit. / []
He is so guilty, he never should have done this interview as a  defense , he sunk himself🤣🤣🤣 / []
In the future, we will witness the normalization of pedophilia. Only prison can stop this degradation, for everyone, even the privileged members of the monarchy. / []
How was the Falklands war Andrew? It’s wasn’t a war! It was just a straight forward shooting weekend 😂 / []
He wasnt so happy to meet the interviewer by the end of the Interview,Idiot to think of the things he said and how much he hung himself out to dry in this Interview,To think he only did this interview cause hes daughter talked him into it,She deserves a medal for it💯😂 / []
“Liar liar…” you know the rest…. / []
He's got the I Q of a turnip / []
"...the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him (Epstein) or because of him were actually very useful..."   I wonder what he's actually learned that were so useful. / []
He keeps saying he was only friends with Epstein thru his "girlfriend" (Maxwell, who was actually his procurer by that point, was Andrew aware of that?). And yet Andrew felt he had to "break up with in person" this guy who was supposedly just a "plus-one" for Maxwell. Huh?? / []
He keeps emphasizing how he was able to meet and learn from the circle of "eminence" around Epstein. I think he could have afforded to go to a university and take some classes if he really had wanted to "learn stuff". / []
What an honest man! Hell he has too much honor! / []
this was before the leaked email ??? oops / []
Pedifile.  Put him in prison. / []
What a surprise, he did a interview with the bbc, now we know he's guilty , there are alot of people in this country that are now fully awake, Our number's are rising daily... / []
I actually believe him, he should never have done this interview, she put him on trial.  Why would he walk into it voluntarily and subject himself to interrogation, and as most people said, dig himself deeper.  He thought he had nothing to fear. / []
This is my favorite video on the internet / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
🤔it’s time for a lie detector now / []
Back here to warmly commemorate the world’s first 49-minute car crash / []
Pizza Hut Woking claim no negative energy / []
His reaction then a moment later - I don’t know this guy. So why react like that? Couldn’t be more guilty - this is the dark side of the uk. He’s an evil man imo. / []
Anybody here in november 2025 after Andrew renounced his titles? / ["He didn't renounce them though - he was stripped of them. Renouncing makes it sound like it was his choice 😂", '\u200b@katebunnychaiYou got it right!', 'Yep I am - gets even better every time you watch it. If I were more honourable I wouldn’t be watching it again…?']
Jeffrey ,  ....we cannot see each other ....unless you invite me for Dinner / []
We have starving vets and dieing and the royals get millions every week smh / []
The whole royal family spit on us from high and people still love and respect them smh / []
School kid liar mannerisms / []
Epstein: ''Why don't you come to use my houses?''  Andrew:''oh that's very kind, thank you very much indeed'' 😂😂😂😂 / []
Just Andrew from now on they say? - tell that to his servants. He will never run his own bath, make his own bed, cook for himself, shop at Tesco's, mow the lawn, polish his own shoes, feed his horses, clean up after himself, or answer the door. Andrew says in this interview he ' doesn't wish to appear grand' He in fact demanded to be grand the moment he discovered he was Royal. Just ask his servants and anyone else that puts up with this insufferable dick!!! / []
what a liar should be in jail / []
“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, which is exactly why I paid her £12,000,000 👍🏻” / []
“I was more friends with his girlfriend than him, which is exactly why I flew across the Atlantic and stayed with him for 4 days so I could go to the park with him and tell him we can’t be seen with each other.” / []
O que você faz de errado escondido volta para te assombrar no futuro. / []
He SO thought he was going to get away with it! / []
Brilliant interview technique well done Emily - 👍🏼 / []
Fucked up peculiar disgusting sweating dancing prince 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Prince Andrew? I think you mean Andrew Windsor. 😂 / []
Look at this piece of garbage / []
He is guilty as sin.😡👎 / []
This is the worst lying in the history of lying.Maitlis is taking far too much credit for this.Anyone could wipe the floor with this cretin.He reminds me of George prince of Wales in blackadder. / []
Who is watching this in November, 2025? / []
"there is no good time to talk about Mr. Epstein", how perfect an introduction that was! / []
17:14-16  "We weren't that close." Then he wrote to Epstein 'We're in this together.' 😅 / []
This guy looks and sounds guilty as anything, a FCKN LIAR 🤮🤮🤮 / []
He’s a disgrace and typical of what so many members of the Royal family are and have been proven to be throughout history. This is what power and influence does, it lowers the bar beyond what any normal people would call decency. He’s clearly Squirming and knows he’s guilty of all the allegations being thrown at him here. / []
Watch as the journalist says you had sex with Virginia and he is nodding his head - literally saying yes and yet denying! / ['well spotted']
The interviewer of this interviewer requires a round of applause 🙌 / []
He is a very intelligent and well educated man! Never heard him speak before or even seen him. Have only ever heard his name along the way. To me he is very convincing. / []
Horrible.. / []
Most pathetic moment- "When the accusations came out I thought, well, that's a bit strange, I don't remember this." / []
Liar / []
To learn on how to bullshit smoothly everyone should watch this and learn how not to do it 😅 / []
😂😂😂Andrew with that slapped ass lying look 👀 / []
Andrew and Jeffrey are predators. / []
Still that is NOT justice(((((((((((((((( He is alive & he is in house & living the dream((((((((((((((( He should be BEHIND BARS FOR 100 YEARS. NOTHING LESS, NOTHING MORE(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( / []
He never says that epstien was wrong only that he shouldn't see him anymore. He just is vile and was obviously involved in things / []
All the stuttering is a dead give away  May Virginia RIP / []
Lying scumbag.  Throw his ass out of the mansion in the middle of the night!  Good job Charles. / []
Andy was about having &ex with underaged girls… sickening / []
He gets his royal status stripped but no arrest or convictions. Not that I agree with pedophilism but yet again one rule for them different for us / ['Here\'s my prediction: \nCharles is moving him to Sandringham, a vast estate in Norfolk.  Once there,  a hunting "accident " will be arranged in which Andrew will be killed.']
Virginia…we believe you. Justice is slow but it’s happening. Rest in peace. / ["100% and is it categorically confirmed and 100% certain she has definitely passed away (ie death not staged for personal safety) and even then don't believe everything you hear. Unless it's categorically without question suicide I remain sceptical."]
Think andrew needs tobdo a lie detector test none of what he is saying makes sence !!!😮 / []
the lying C unt / []
This is pure comedy 😅 pure gold from the Formally Know as Prince 😅 / []

Liar andrew / []
And we pay taxes for that prick, imagine that. This is what it is, pay for his sick mind to be satisfied. Guy like him in normal life will be in prison for long time. I hope his karma will be paid soon, for all the victims hi used as dolls, for simple proof that justice still exist. Hope all victims will show up now for testimony and get rid off that person from our life. As royal member you have everything provided to spend your life as amazing person, you have everything to the end of this dream. So in favour you can use your title and name and power to make your nation live better life too, and yet hi choose only himself and sick needs. Sad story but need to be awaken before the dream is over. Good Bless Britain for this revelation. Thank You / []
Four times? , No , how many times ? ,possibly four. / []
GGrrr prince horrid!! / []
I CAN DEFINITELY SAY THAT BRITISH MEDIA GOES EASY ON THEIR INTIERVIEWS..... IF HE WAS INTIERVIEWED OR INTERIGATED IN THE UNITED STATES, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED APART! / []
He looks like wormtail / ['hahahaha thanks']
I get it now - he has Alzhiemers. / []
49:22 " Im truly gratefull of the opportunity you have given me to dig my own grave" 😂 / []
He's such a LIAR! / []
PIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PERFERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SICK I hope you rot in HELL ................................................. / []
hes very nervous in this interview   he keeps saying um um um um and licking his lips / []
God it's a cringefest to watch this now knowing he has lied throughout! 🤮🤢🤮 / []
What goes around comes around.  Virginia was correct. Or he wouldn't have lost his title. / []
USA he says eminence. What i want to know is WHO ELSE WAS INVOLVED???!!! / []
I hate when interviewers call children under 18 women or men. All minor children are girls or boys. It doesn’t matter how many times they were molested, sex does not turn children into adults. / []
Liar liar pants on fire. / []
Half-wits like him make it easy for Israel/Mossad / []
This is actually pure comedy / []
Lying git / []
Massive deal about him losing the "prince" title... "Banished" to Sandringham??? Come on... It is all just words and no action, more needs to be done. / ['Once out of the way he will be bumped off in a hunting accident perhaps.']
Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the stripping back is complete, and it all started from this insanity!! / []
An absolute dumbass, he contradicts himself in the same sentence over and over again. Not the brains of the family. / []
He is just a complete imbecile!!, the thing is that he should be in jail!!, but jail is only for normal people, this lot get scotch free!! / []
The Greek Orthodox Church got involved to setup my family in Los Angeles. I wonder if their judgement is as bad as this guys / []
King Charles had dealings with Jimmy saville too. / []
As a member of the Royal family, I try to uphold the highest standards & practices." 😂 Like Fergie, borrowing over $2M from Epstein in $100k chunks? / []
Advisors.  Put on a 5 grand suit ...get a peasant to shine your shoes and iron your shirt... do a lovely Windsor knot on your tie.. and everything will be OK. JUST DONT SPEAK.  Awww fk you spoke 😂 / []
It's very suspicious that Epstein is dead aswell. / []
It's very suspicious that Virginia is now dead. / []
Lol where  they deporting  this one 😂😂😂😂 / []
The 16 words this fool only had to say in the very beginning,  “I asked her three or four times if she was of age ? She always said yes”  that would have been the end of it , but no it’s the coverup that gets them every damn time..it would have been Her word against His ,the end. / []
This interview will go down in history. / []
Pinncchico is a real boy / []
The grand old duke of York had £14 million quid..he gave it to someone he'd never met  and something he never did. Usa ..Get him extradited and in court. / []
I actually do believe him about the photograph though because I can't imagine one of the royals taking such a casual picture with a girl because that would lead to questions. And they would have to be very careful about that. Wills and Kate are very casual and very open with their feelings but I don't think that the other royals have been. / ['STRICTLY speaking he has never been actually found legally guilty of anything']
I didn't see 100's of young girls.  I didn't have eyes then. / ['LMFAO 😅😅']
Hang about...ive never been upstairs in that house...but I know that's upstairs...how? That's definitely me in that photo but I'm not sure that's my hand around her waist....but I've never met  her? 😂😂😂😂 / []
The horrible telling body language of this man would choke a blue whale.😮 / []
If you never did anything wrong - why would you pay someone off and give up everything if your innocent - in my eyes paying someone off we call that being blackmailed / []
29:21 "Defin..def..def... definitely didn't." He's channeling 'Rainman'! 😅 / []
He couldn't afford a hotel in a city the size of New York.😂😂 / []
You learn something every day ,today I had a rumour about Andrew confirmed , he’s an inarticulate lying POS … / []
Randy Andy is royally screwed / []
DOWN WITH PEDOPHILE ROYALS !!! HANG ANDY FOR TREASON TO THE CROWN AND COUNTRY ABUSING YOUNG GIRLS SEXUALLY THAT WHERE UNDER AGE !!!! / ['Charles with Jimmy saville too']
He sounds like Markle.  Double talk galore. / []
"My judgement was clouded by my tendency to be TOO honourable." 😂 Oookaaay Andy. So honourable that you use your DAUGHTERS as an alibi? 🤢 His ability to lie so easily under pressure is phenomenal. / []
He needs some teddy bear earrings.🧸🧸 / []
This makes me so angry 😡😡 how is he not in prison ?? He’s guilty as anything!!!!  Watching this is getting me so angry! / ['You gone be happy to see him in prison?']
It's not just the Royals that do this, but the self-important stammering just drives me bananas!🍌🍌🍌🤷🍌 / []
He is just another entitled freak who is void of conscience and believes he can get away with murder. His voice alone is enough to make me sick. / []
Who's here after Charlie Kirk was shot? / []
isolated in the navy.....international business learning....LOL what a joke. What a bird brain. hahahaha He didn't think of going to University??? LMAO they even have online online university classes. / []
LOL he never partied.  LOL maybe he doesn't know what the word partied means. / []
Gotta love that pizza express in Woking / []
Was it his arrogance that thought he would end this interview as an innocent victim. The interview nailed him to the wall... / []
What was he doing there and who paid for him to be there / []
This is what happens when someone is spoiled their entire life and living the life of Riley. So arrogant and entitled he thought he could do whatever he wanted because for most of his life, he did!! / []
Andrew is such a shameless entitled LIAR 😅 / []
This aged like fine wine 😂 / []
The eyes is the key to the soul .. Liar / []
When was the last time you spoke with Ghislaine? Funnily enough we’re having dinner after this. Would you like to join us? / []
Bros brain shutdown mid interview / []
I had to fly to tell someone I ‘wasn’t close to' that we can longer be in contact…😅 / ['The bullshit artist formerly known as "prince"...', '😂😂😂😂']
Wow, the stutter is such a tell that he is lying. It’s almost comical. As wonderful as Emily is here, if this man is ever deposed by American prosecutors he is toast. / []
The thing about it this Virgenia case  it was reported that the age for having sex in England is 16 years so why did they made a meal of it is not England a permersive country ???? there is lots of men having forbidden  sex in middle East countries and locally in every countries these are  covered up and nothing been said about it Andrew is not going to be the first and last person to be in this dilemma / []
Creepy guy he didn't no / []
12 million views and counting…I bet his saturated in sweat. 😂😂 / []
pathetic figure / []
None of the so-called men in that disgusting family are actually manly enough to own their despicable actions, including Charles (considering what he did to Diana but never had the courage to own anything until his wife dropped the bomb on what was going on behind the scenes). More importantly, Mummy dear has been in cahoots with her sons all along, protecting them and providing for them no matter how they continued to operate. Disgraceful family! / []
He now finally got what he deserved and his wife as well!!! / []
Twice, when Emily states "Epstein is dead" - Andrew chuckles/laughs - then answers the question. What is so funny about Epstein being dead - why does Andrew find that amusing? Most friends, upon learning they died, respond in a manner that is sad or downhearted - they don't find it hilarious. Andrew....oh Andrew..... / ['Exactly. Why is this moment not a huge thing? Why did they not cut to his face while he chuckles? … I thought I was the only one who noticed. Your comment made my day.', "@VolkerThimm This is the 2nd time I've watched this masterful interview by Maitlis.  The first time I noticed that chuckle - the 2nd time, I realised I was alarmed by it.  You're right - why wasn't a big deal made of this?  It shows how twisted and dark Andrew really is.  I wouldn't be surprised, with that kind of response, if he ever actually murdered someone.  It has that kind of pathology to me.  I'm glad you noticed too.", '\u2060@London20258 I just watched it again as well and can‘t wrap my head around it. I just donˋt know why they cut to an over shoulder when he chuckles?! „Epstein is dead“ totally caught him of guard and he showed his true emotions. How do you guys say? Duper‘s Delight?! - That cut away is outrageous.', "@VolkerThimm I'm an American who has lived in London for 10 years now - grateful to be in this country altogether.  As awful as this sounds - paying attention to Andrew Mountbatten Windsors horrid behaviour gives me some relief from the nightmare and demise of America under the convicted felon in the WH.", '\u2060\u200b\u2060\u200b\u2060\u200b\u2060@London20258 It‘s MISTER Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. Show some respect please. 😂\n\nBut you‘re right. Having a senior member of the royal family having sex with underage girls is like a tuesday afternoon in Washington D.C. 😅 \nIt‘s kinda scary that we as a society get numb against this kind of behavior from people we „accept“ as our representatives. No matter the political opinion. \nAnyway … it‘s MIster. 😂']
rubbish / []
He went over for more / []
Ñot  credible / []
This is what you learn from whites lying is good take note denie denie denie / []
I didn't know they had a comedy loser it's me / []
Lying little prick Sweeny qweeny who's got Andrew's balls / []
Good riddance, liar. / []
😂😂bet he is sweating now !!! / []
Randy Andy / []
And the Oscar goes to.....?  😆 / []
I bet this liar so wishes that he could go back to the 1980s ....... deserves to be in prison doing a very long prison sentence in a maximum security prison / []
Yes, but he admits to having been to Palm Beach several times. That's enough, isn't it? It must have been obvious what was going on there. He didn't go there to buy flowers, did he? Damn it all. It was obvious that it was about sex with Epstein. Good heavens. Epstein wasn't a wine merchant, was he? / []
But at that time he was in the USA, specifically in a city near New York - Boston! The security personnel should be questioned. / []
PRISON / []
Ok people! Which is the most cringeable moment of this car crash?  I think it's at 13:42. 😂 / []
But that's surely a lie now. I heard before that Andrew had a drinking problem. The Sultan of Dubai even complained to the Queen about Andrew's drunken behavior. That was when Andrew was in Dubai. Well, maybe he doesn't drink anymore. But we're talking about the period from 1999 to 2006. / []
Very happy when married yet hired 40 prostitutes on a 4 day trip to Thailand / []
you will reap what u sow lier / []
Young man - It's over!! He still receives security protection, and so do his daughters, and he's basically a criminal who abused innocent girls who had no security protection. Unbelievable. I'm so glad he no longer has security and is no longer a prince. I'm so happy about that!! / []
I'm German, and I don't really want to interfere; that's really a matter for the British people. But I'm glad that Prince Andrew's two daughters have also had their titles revoked. Really. It's far too expensive for the British people, and none of the Yorks lived modestly, not even Fergie. I just want to know where Fergie's money came from in recent years that she was still able to finance such a lifestyle! The British people can no longer afford something like that. I've seen a lot of abject poverty in Liverpool. And Epstein's victims were all poor girls who had been promised so much. And these two daughters of Andrew do nothing but travel and party. Why aren't Andrew, his two daughters, and Fergie ashamed of themselves? / ['Thank you. I believe in the Monarchy, but we need to reduce spending.\n\n  The people at the top of society should receive less. However we should also reduce welfare.\n\n People should be productive.  Andrew was NOT productive; he was harmful.  People on benefits are generally not productive. They CHOOSE not to work.  Ordinary people in The U.K. are tired of supporting spongers at the top... and bottom of society!']
He actually left this interview, according to the journalist who interviewed him, feeling that he had done a great job and was proudly stating this out loud. Apparently walking around like a proud peacock. What an ass clown. / ['The response from the interviewer was gold though: "What sir, like a walk in the park?" 😂', '@retronimo😂']
Maitliss does Anal / []
Liar / []
His response regarding Epstein's death is...telling... / []
Embarrassment for veterans. / []
Sounds just as legit as it did five years ago. I can’t believe he’s still not in jail / []

Goooooorgeous English ! .... but a disgusting personality. A bloody liar. Que verguenza para el rest de la familia ! / []

An obvious LIAR. Disgraceful / []
Possibly the greatest interview of all time,  What an embarrassment to the Royal Family he has been,  Apparently Mr Mountbatten Can't Sweat and Can't Lie Either. / []
Lying bastard…I hope the Epstein files are released and it takes down the entire western hemisphere of governments / []
“She said you danced, sweated and then had sex three times” - his response “I can’t sweat so that can’t be me” - has to be the dumbest response I have ever witnessed in my entire life. How can anyone be this stupid? / []
November 2025 / []
Oh, hi Andrew. Didn't this go well...... / []
What work?  He never worked a day in his life. And by the way, where did he get the 12 million from to pay off this girl?   Your taxpayers? / []
Liar / []
Sure is eye blocking a lot😂😂😂😂 / []
Sitting there with categorical confidence knowing just how depraved and disguisting things he has done, knowing fully he will never pay the price... / []
I come back and watch this. Watching a now former prince end himself on tv is rare footage indeed. / []
Whenever someone says give them enough rope, I’ll always remember this,  it’s one of those moments I’ll remember where I was when I watched this. I can only remember 2 times in my life when I genuinely watched the TV with my mouth wide open, September 11 and this. / []
JACKONORY, JACKONORY Any one else would be up the  jail  he's blatantly hiding something / []
Thick, lying, privileged . / []
If you've fancy a laugh, watch this interview, with the intro from the song oh yeah by yello playing on a loop in the background.   Turns this into a 10/10 comedy. / []
"I have no recollection of that photo being taken"  "I've no recollection of going upstairs because that's where the photograph was taken, upstairs". Alright Andrew 😂 / []
Wee all know now Andrew is a liar and corrupt. / []
You know he left this interview and said he give Emily one / []
Birds of a feather, stick together. Liar's and con men! / []
Went to dinner and met all these great people, all these great peeedos is more like it / []
I remeber it weirdly distinctly... You have to admire the choice of words. / []
He's like one of those noblemen straight out of a Joe Abercrombie novel / []
It was the Chicken's way of doing it 🤣. This guy is an idiot. / []
his energy is so scattered and creepy! / []
He's a terrible lyer. Everything is cloudy, he can't remember pretty much anything. He must think the average person is stupid. / []
Randy Andy Realllllly F%@# Up here!!!  As he said it, "he's going to be kicking himself" on a daily basis until grave for the truth that he revealed her. 😅Braaaavo to Ms.Emily Maitlis for sticking up the big fist up his A$$ in this interview: She actually stood up for ALL the victims by doing this fantastic confession. Brilliant & she's so chic 🤘 / []
There is a slight problem with sweating you die if you don't 😂 / []
bad juudgement decisions / []
I watched this trainwreck when it came out originally and I find myself now in 2025 (after his title stripping) watching this again with three questions I have on this second go around.  1) If you weren’t good friends with him, as you say more friends with his girlfriend, then why would you need to fly to his house to tell this person, who remember you’re not friends with, that your friendship is ending?  2) When discussing the photograph, why would you tell us that the photograph was taken upstairs and in the same breath say you never have been upstairs which you presumably don’t know what it looks like?  3) How is it that you never saw any signs of trafficking because you knew what to look for as a patron of NSPCC but yet you also admit you have been on his flying bedroom aka private jet? / []
It was a convenient place to stay  with a convicted sex offender with known proof and record of his convictions. we suppose you were out of funds to stay elsewhere  else. 🙄  Andrew belongs in Prison!   along with many others!! / []
he obviously does not have good advisors.  he has just sealed himself as a first class educated LIARRR!!    Public is waiting on the rest of the List!!! / []
You got busted. Just admit it / []
Watching this interview for the first time in 2025, proves that no matter how well prepared you may have been by your legal team (even if it took them 6 months to prepare) it is up to you to try and convince the audience about your story BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOUR STORY HAS FAR TO MANY LOOPHOLES ANDREW / []
Iam not convinced either way / []
Everything is no...or cant remember unless is benefiting him... / []
I will come in person to said just it...with our friendship..n I must showed leadership ... Sounds great isn't... / []
Finally… / []
this man is a compulsive liar....and he keep a straight face while telling lie / []
Man f*CK Britain and the Royal family 😂 / []
Prince Andrew, Innocent! / []
This interview does *NOT* incriminate Andrew.  What people interpret as sinister is what a person who is very frightened might be expected to say. The "cannot sweat" is nonsense, proves nothing except that Andrew's thinking is jammed from extreme emotion.  His 'alibi' of buying fast food also shows he cannot think.  Not because he is stupid but because he is terrified. The photo of Andrew with his arm around Virginia's waist points suspicion at Epstein who probably took the photo, and at Ghislaine (visible in the same photo) for springing a blackmailing/defamation honey trap that took Andrew by surprise.  Andrew was not at Epstein's home but Ghislaine's in London.  What is acknowledged is that Andrew is promiscuous.  But while he manifestly enjoys sexual company of young women he is not necessarily going after girls below the legal age of consent. / ["Even though I don't believe anything he says you would be a good lawyer for him and the first thing he should've shut his flapping big mouth", 'Why would anyone defend royal pedos is beyond me']
The New York police department probably would let Mr. epstein stay over free of charge / []
He insults our intelligence / []
Unfortunately he is not believable, easy to see what a shame. / []
13:42 fake surprised facial expression FTW! / []
He makes me ill. Trump should be there beside him, paying the price. / []
He actually thought it was a good interview.  No sense of self, no sense of decency, no care for the damage he’s done. Spoilt child who never grew up. / []
It's like when a child has chocolate around their mouth and they say to their parents I didn't eat the chocolate. You know they are lying. / []
"As it were.....as it were......as it were...." What a liar. / []
I'm confused....yes that is definitely me stood next to her..but im not sure that's my hand. THEN ITS IVE NEVER MET HER? SO I PAID HER....OR MUMMY DID .....12 MILLION POUNDS....😂😂😂😂 / []
postive action? WTF? / []
He really is full of it / []
What a complete vile human being.  So he remembered absolutely taking his daughter to pizza express...2 sentences later...over yes...when someone reminded me of that...oooo yes I remember.  This person needs to be dragged to America to answer questions. / []
Its almost like a sketch / []
Claims he hasn't been upstairs but says the photo was taken upstairs... / []
My God he's weak. / []
The Falkland War was in 1982, Andrew / []
"We're not that close" but i have to formally see this guy in person to break our friendship, and stay for multiple days bc it's a convenience..... Okay. / []
Hos can you say you dont sweat? / []
They were not close friends but he felt obligated to go formally break up the friendship even after those terrible allegations against Epstein... Okay Andrew, got it! / []
It would be a considerable stretch to say that he was a good friend, but he let you stay in houses??? BULLSHIT x 100 / []
Thanks to Dr. Todd Grande, I have been reminded of this remarkable interview and can now peacefully fall asleep, knowing that I am not as surrounded by problematic people as I had thought. I have a feeling he was not stripped of his titles for being inappropriate with a minor, but purely for stupidity. / []
this is what a lying narcissist looks like, plain and simple. He thinks he's smarter than anyone else . What an embarrassment to be his daughters. / []
He looks like Nigel from eastenders lol / []
Hang the pedo’s. Who ever it is / []
I imagine the few people that may have adored him probably feel like i did when i found out Jesus wasnt real lol total betrayal 🎉😢 its good at least he was held accountable now somewhat for all the people he hurt / []
Why would you email Epstein at 1:59 AM in the morning - in 2010 - someone you claim - “it’s a stretch to call him a close friend” - only 5 years ago via this interview / []
He said a service is being used from ages 5 to 95. What service is he talking about? / []
Yet again another sex offender rubbing our noise in it like jimmy Savile! / []
Unbelievable / []
Classic denial here…🤦‍♀️ oh no I never saw a thing or suspected a thing thru ALL those visits! Totally ridiculous! / []
Biggest clown that ever existed / []
I don’t understand why with the photo taken is it a problem if you’re not guilty / []
27:29 He stayed in the house for days but never went upstairs? / []
Hot n sweaty. Yum yum🎉 / []
I don’t recall, I have no recollection - but I remember being at pizza express 🙈 / []
Diana was right, he is the stupidest of the 4. He built his own hell (it's Halloween wknd). / []
14:20 No no she wasn't Russian - but Ukrainian. / []

The interview was a huge success. The foemer prince was exposed as a lier and a twit. / []
The intwrview was a huge success. The former prince was exposed as a lier, narasstic twir. / []
He believes his own lies. / []

Now Andrew Windsor is dethroned, so to speak, will Trump be next? / []
To rehabilitate himself he was advised to do charity work. So he is opening a home for 'wayward' young girls. / []
Just look at Andrew s face. He definitely  bonking them full  of coke. I want to learn  in the navy. What a shooting wknd was.nice little fillies  flying around ready to b grabbers.  Send him down 😮 / []
Props to the BBC for not editing all of the cringe moments. Holy cow! / []
If a prince cannot afford accommodations in NYC what do you expect from hourly employees? / []

Whyd you pay 12 million quid to someone youve never met🤦 / []
4 times a year???? / []
Said goodbye to Epstein - then stayed at his house for four days … / []
None of us are perfect we all sin and fall short of glory of god. Virgina wasn't a child. This is not child abuse. She wasn't much younger than Andrew. She had a choice to. It looks more like an escorts agency. Young women working for pimps. I feel Andrew is not bad as publick make out didn't prince Charles hv 2 women in his life. Cammila is no different. I pray for Andrew understand why he's so angry but I pray he knows Jesus Christ as his saviour. Virgina looked really happy smiling with Andrew this is not the look of child abuse . Or someone  in torture / ['Stop taking drugs', 'He was 23 years older than her and in a position of power', 'Wtf. People are really blaming the victims ?']
King Charles is a bit of a hypocrite. What he did to Dianna, unforgivable. Cheated on their wedding night?! I find that rich famous people feel entitled to do whatever they  Want.    What Andrew did was wrong totally 💯 wrong. Child molesting .  Sin is sin we r all as filthy rags.  Shame best to fix our sin on this side of the fence. We all have to face our maker .  It would be a big wait off Andrew’s back and he would show himself as a man.  So should the King. / []
Is this concept of “man needing Positive action to have sex” a British thing or something?!😂 What an odd explanation. / ["I've never heard anyone say it. Delicately done but a bit odd!"]
He's  horrible weak monster / []
I mean it's been 5 years what the heck? / []
This has to be the best interview i've ever watched. / []
What a train wreck / []
What an arrogant, unapologetic, cold hearted, lying son of a b*tch. / []
Now we understand his bumbling; his focus was on the lie, and he sent emails expressing a desire to meet Epstein in 2011. He was such a foolish man, unable to consider anything beyond that. His understanding seemed to be that a "walk in the park" equaled a breakup, showing he lacked the mental capacity to handle further questioning. Rest in peace, Virginia. We will never forget you. 🙏🙏 / []
Amazing how many are able to judge and kick when he’s down.  Frankly I can see how much of what he is saying is true.  Pretty bad if he is innocent and she’s been able to smear reputation.  Seems weird she’s only attacked and accused him,  not all the others through the house.  Apart from anything she hardly looked a child she looks 20 so he’s not into children.  . / ['Bot', 'Defending pdfiles is what you wanna do with your free time ?']

The legendary Newsnight interview😂, the Shakespearean tragedy disguised as a public relations exercise. *Every time despair creeps in and life begins to resemble a soggy crumpet, I simply revisit this masterpiece of royal self-combustion*. *Within minutes, I’m cackling like a court jester on espresso*. 😂 Prince Andrew, you magnificent embodiment of “what not to say under any circumstances,” you are the gift that keeps on giving. The sheer audacity with which you claimed an inability to perspire,  truly, medical science wept. And the Pizza Express alibi? Utter poetry. No stand-up comedian could ever match the exquisite absurdity of this moment.😂  *In short, whenever my mood falters, I don’t seek therapy* , *I simply watch this interview, and suddenly, life feels gloriously ridiculous again*. Bravo, Your Royal Highness. Never has royal protocol collided so spectacularly with modern television. 👑😂 / []
21:49. wtf was that? "how old was she? yes" ???? / []
Look at that smug face remembering pizza express. But he doesn't have a recollection of the trafficking of young girls / []
“I was seen with Epstein in the public park to tell him it’s not appropriate to remain in contact with each other.”  My brain just exploded hearing him say that. / []
When she mentions John Brockman, the reaction is hilarious. He acts shocked and says 'really' and then says he doesn't know Mr Brockman.  Why the fake reaction when she mentions his name then?   Then he keeps saying 'I have no recollection' I would say, no chance, never met her, never heard of her and I don't bang 17 year olds, he says 'no recollection' Interesting choice of words. / ["Yeah, then when Maitlis says that John Brockman saw him getting a foot massage from a young girl, and he says it never happened - She then asks him: 'So JB's statement is false?' Instead of just saying 'Yeah, it isn't true', he says 'Well, I don't know JB, so I don't know what he's talking about!' How does him not knowing him, have anything to do with his being able to say if something is true or false...What a weasley 🤡"]
Straight forward shooting weekend! Oh, the high life. / []
He not only disgraced his late mother Queen Elizabeth  but his whole family. / []
The US Justice Service has recently reached out to Andrew (a private UK citizen) to offer a virtual meeting to assist with their investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Anything that Andrew knows about Jeffrey would be a massive help to their inquiries and would help the victims of sexual abuse. If Andrew has nothing to hide then why does he choose to hide from their inquiries. They have offered all sort of IT arrangements i.e. to have a solicitor present in a Teams meeting. You would have thought he would jump at the chance to help the victims because he is a high profile figure. Andrew says he had to show leadership & go in person to see Jeffery so why does he not show the same leadership in helping with the US inquiries. We have a legal system in the UK whereby you have to prove someone guilty you can't just assume someone is guilty. In the case of this UK citizen Andrew is proving himself to be guilty by not attending a Zoom/Teams session. There are things in this interview which have proven to be untrue. This man is 8th in line to the British throne & will be moved to the Sandringham estate to be hidden from public gaze. He has enjoyed fingering the vaginas of underaged girls & will not be punished as a sex pest. Hiding a sex pervert who is 8th in line does not put Britain in a good light. Andrew assumed he was entitled to sex & has a warped understanding of how an honourable person should behave. There is only one outcome. Andrew needs to do time in prison alongside other sex offenders. That would be the honourable thing to do. / []
he reminds me of Prince Regent (Black Adder) / []
Damn, that guy is stupid. Making an interview and being zero prepared and not even able to wing a convincible story, is a sign of total absence of self criticism. / []
This dirty disgusting man should be in prison. He’s staying in a pedophile man’s house not because he can’t afford his own five star hotel but because he was a party to what was happening. He supposedly put himself in a house where he doesn’t know what’s going on… bs. / []

This interview was beautifully conducted and really allowed Andrew to express himself. However, this interview also highlights how “out of touch Andrew is” he tries to portray himself as this innocent and horrible man. His arrogance brings him down and makes him looks utterly stupid. The excuses and answers to some of the questions are just a joke…I reckon he would be a good stand up comedian 😂😂😂 / ['It’s a good idea actually.

Lying through his teeth. Very difficult to believe a thing he is saying. / []
I’ve never seen someone botch an interview so badly / []
bring back old English Law / []
Wow / []
He shot himself in the foot 10 times it's wonder he has any toes left. / []
The title of this video should be "Prince Andrew's Remembers Nothing" 😅 / []
The sweating one kills me. A medical condition!? He also used to go to Tramp all the time back in his single days, theres no way he didn’t know where the bar was. / ["He's too honourable to sweat"]
Did he ever fxck his dirty slutty daughters ??? I bet they smell of old cum from who know 's where. Gang bang ??? or a family member ??? Did he get the corgis pregnant ??? / []
If I make up a lie, Wonder if he pay me 12 million? / []
He is trying way too hard to talk himself out of it 😂😂😂😂😂😂. While his memory is playing a very different film it seems. / []
But he was staying at his house for 4 days 😢😅😂 / []
Lying 🤥 / []

Andrew has been stripped of his ”prince” title according to BBC News report from yesterday, 31 October 2025. Justice? / []
Pls watch the 'body language video' of Andrew's reaction to all these direct questions. Apparently, Elizabeth was horrified when she found out that Andrew had agreed to this BBC1 interview. It must have been awful for Lillibet! :( / []
Wow.  He is quite a liar. / []
This whole situation is only a big deal if you hold PA to some sort of higher standard + expect a certain level of morality in his behaviour. Why anyone would do so, is beyond me?..?...?..... Having sex with a 17-year old girl isn't a crime, + neither is associating with the likes of Epstein, or any other form of scum you might encounter. I don't see what the big deal is, we're not talking about the Arch Bishop of Canterbury, he's a minor Royal until he's suddenly more significant for the convenience of selling a scandal narrative. 'Older bloke has sex with a young girl + spends time with a criminal.' Not much of a headline, it covers it, though, unless you see the guy as something other than ordinary, which you have to if you believe he deserves being put on trial. He's superior, a cut above regular folks, I don't mean posh, I'm talking higher virtue. Before I go, this young lady, she wasn't kept locked up, was she? What kept her on-site? 3 times she was there, in 3 different locations, taking smiley group photos that came in very handy later on, a real stroke of luck. She was a victim, apparently, although she looked like a fan, to me, but everyone seems to believe her. 'He knows what he did', she says, so tell us, ffs!!! What did he do?!?!?                                                          Did he do it 3 times???? How did he manage that???? I don't know what happened, everyone else does, though, but no one will say it out loud, Like I said before, it's beyond me......... / []

Prince Andrew needs to be prosecuted for being a pedophile and placed on a sex offender list. / []
Andrew is so smug, so entitled, and so stupid to do this interview. His arrogance in this interview was epic. / ["LET'S NOW ACTUALLY BE THANKFUL THAT HE IS ALL THOSE THINGS OR THIS INTERVIEW WOULD'VE NEVER HAPPENED AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS EVENT IMMORTALIZED TO SHOW HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY REALY IS", 'What advice if any did he seek before this interview. This is how to conduct an interview and stay in control.', 'What a creep . Omg he’s typical of these types of. Yuk makes me sick . Hope he goes to prison it’s starting to look that way .']
He looks hesitant in answering questions and it looks suspicious!  He should go to the US and answer questions from Congress. Like Virginia's  brother has stated, the king should meet Virginia's family and hear their concern. Her family should come to London and meet the King. Give interviews to the press. / []
You are a boil on the heel of the royal family. / []
Scumbag! / []
Andrew was an elite honey pot capture by Epstein / []
The creep he is the doing of his bringing up. A child is but a white sheet; how you taint it is entirely the work of the one who draws on it... / []
hmmm.this man is a real kicker...ok,he remembers NOTHING at all frome any of the shady things he has done to that young girl,but its nothing  wrong with his memory the exsackt date whene he was baying pizza"s fore the kids....WOW.... / []

Bet he’s sweating now though ehhh 😂😂😂😂 hate his lying ar*e / []
Damn.. she nailed him.. / []
Ewww ewww ewww ewww I literally cannot explain how much I despise him and his wife, I always said there was something dirty about him , he was spoiled so much by his mother ,he was and still is a narcissistic spitting his dummy out little vile human being so is his ex Mrs they’d sell their sole to the devil for couple million eeegggghhhh / []
No sweat. / []
Bet that interview hit different when he got home and realized, “Welp, they caught me. Game over. / []

Anyone else hear “if push came to shove and THE LID” cough the legal advice said to do so. 😡 / []
Give the Palestinians away to prince Andrew / []
Should put him on Jeremy Kyle show & lock him up / []
The best thing about this interview is the integrity of the interviewer and that she is female. / []
a lot of meaningless words,with so much lying going on. / []
He is a filthy prick! And needs to go to prison!! / []
Who is here to see if he has any compassion at all for any of the victims? / []
The fact he thought this was a good idea, and thought it went well. Such a repulsive man. / ['His narcassitic ego is his downfall']
How and why did he know girls at University 🤔🤔🤔🤔 / []
All he had to do was show a remorse and own up to his mistakes. Yet his arrogance got in the way of it and as of today he’s being stripped of all his titles. / []
Why did you stay at a sex offenders house? "Because I'm too honourable"! lol / []
What a tool / []
He lies worse then Trump lol 😂 / ['It takes self awareness to lie convincingly']
"In 2008 he (Epstein) was convicted of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution, he was jailed, this was your friend, how did you feel about it?"  "Well I ceased contact with him after I was aware that he was under investigation."  The only response here should have been that he was utterly mortified by the revelations and then expressed genuine sympathy for the victims, but he does neither of those things. He simply seeks to distance himself from the matter by saying he broke contact with Epstein. Big red flag. Make no mistake, this guy was involved in it up to his neck. / []
Utter entitled scum bag!! 🖕🏻 / []
Should have used the Chewbacca defence. Stronger than the "I don't sweat... or at least I didn't in 2001" defence. / []
It makes me so sad and angry, that poor little girl.. imagine she had dreams and thoughts, and then she had to go with old men. It made me even sicker what she said about "a well known prime minister". Why is not he being sorted out in media? / []
This guy was friend with  Epstein and Maxwell for over 20 years / []
This pervert needs charging / []
Only a pedophile wud go for dinner with a pedophile / []
It is NEVER honorable to spend the night at the home of a convicted sex offender. / ['Andrew is too honourable', 'Unless staying there prevented someone from getting abused, that would be quite honourable.']
He is such a liar !!! Digging his own grave the entire interview / []
He just wouldn’t stop rambling on and on digging in grave, his voice makes my ears bleeds / []
Entitled arrogant I will never caught peado / []
I never realized what a bad fabricater  Andrew is. / []
He has fucked himself 😂😂😂😂 peado / []
Recollections may vary. Or recollections may not exist. The guy believes he should be believed without any recollections over a commoner with precise recollections 🙄🙄🙄 / []
She gave him every opportunity to say "I'm sorry" and he continued to dig his own grave. / []
The latest moves to strip him of all titles and residence are not really to do with justice or apology for or to the abused parties - no - everything is connected with saving and protecting the Monarchy. Andrew is probably quite content to receive financial security from Charles and see the matter significantly closed. My view. / ['Exactly']
Criminal / []
Fumbling liar / []

If you was to turn the volume off when it comes to his answers, his body language speaks guilty alone. Not to mention the Freudian slip onto of everything else / []
He’s the definition of cringe / []
Randy Andy, I plead the 5th and you have the right to remain silent are very real U.S. legal rights...perhaps you should have reviewed Epstein's depositions...but, sir, you'll be extradited here very soon now that you no longer have royal protection to evade U.S. child sex crimes. / []
He’s too dumb to lie🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  serves him right to loose his honor .. Prince dumdum / []
How about Trump? / []
Well you cocked that, didn't you, xxxxhead? / []
God, he's so gross🤮 / []
Another case of Dementia. Chronic amnesia. Release the Epstein files already / []
This interview was the beginning of the end for the “Royal Family”👎🏼  Ps: Andrew “I’ve never really partied “  Can you imagine what he still wants to do? Disgusting! / []
What strikes me is that someone who has spent his entire life being groomed to be a public figure, who knows how to manage his image and how to behave and present himself, would adopt such a naive stance and virtually fail to evoke any empathy from anyone who might have still hoped the wasn't involved in such misconduct. / []
Such A Smug ,Disgraceful Lying Individual!!! He Is So Very Self Centred!!! Lock Him In The 'Tower ' And Throw Away The Key!!!!😱👎😡🫣👀🇬🇧 / []
He seem to believe that people will be crazy to believe him. / []
Omg. Shockingly naive, blatant lies / []

This interview is priceless, how out of touch with reality can someone be!! Whoever in their right mind advised him to do this interview is just as pompous & egotistical 😅 “I cant sweat!” / []
What a devious idiot / ['You can’t be devious and an idiot.']

Today's news oulets claim Ms,Ferguson is in meltdown mode. Is it her impending homelessness, all avenues to money drying up, or is it because she is shitting her pants about what could be leaked about her part in all this? The story that Epstein lent her £15,00 to pay a debt is pish. She's been in debt by millions and not sweated it. So my question is, how much money did she get from him and for what? / []
Let's discuss who is leaking these emails etc. I'd like to buy them a few drinks. / []
Its funny how the royals just cannot resist hanging around with lots of pedophiles...I wonder why? / []
Because he shagged a 17 year old of shall we say of low moral conduct like all rich men do...Big deal or probably in his case, tiny microbial deal. Whats happened to him should happen to the whole royal family.

Too much lying going on!! / []
“We weren’t really good friends, I was more friends with his girlfriend. But our acquaintanceship meant so much to me I had to fly across the Atlantic to tell him we can’t be seen anymore.” / ['Such a blatant liar.']
The BBC is a sycophantic organisation that promotes the royal family. Has done for decades. It's part of the problem.  Just as it enabled Saville and other paedos in their employ.   Need to get rid of the BBC and get rid of tje royal family. The French got it right 200 years ago with the aid of Madame Guillotine. / []
Who is here again in October 2025 to rewatch this abomination / ['I am 😂', 'Myself as well. I’ve never watched it in its entirety and I must be honest, I couldn’t finish it at all. I was cringing almost all the time of the parts that I did see.

His name must be all over the Epstein files.']
“Why don’t they forgive him? Even Charles caused scandals that almost destroyed Britain — yet he was forgiven and crowned. It’s pure hypocrisy and double standards.” / []
“Britain’s protocol seems so harsh — as if Prince Andrew is the only one who ever did something wrong. Where was King Charles when he committed all his acts of betrayal? Why this double standard?” / []
🤣🤣🤣🤣  I can’t believe he thought people were going to believe his weak lies like it was 1901.. What a complete idiot!! Andrew Mount Dickhead! / []
He is now with out anything he’s a prince 😢😢😢😢but In the end, he was stripped of all his royal titles — it’s strange how Britain handles things quietly, behind closed doors.” / []
Andrew andrew andrew formerly known as Prince...wht a MESS.! / []
Just as bad to watch some years later. His fatal error, is his assumption that we’re slightly more stupid than he is. His body language and facial contortions in some of his replies should tell you everything.  The arrogance on display is simply staggering. His self entitlement clear for everyone.   Oh! and Emily Maitlis was simply brilliant. Wow…👏🫶 / []
When you didn't meet someone, you don't say " I don't remember meeting them" you say " I never met them"... that's how we know he is lying / []
I did not expect to live in the timeline where I can genuinely argue I'm lower in the line of succession than this guy. / []
He certainly tripped up on a few of his responses in this disastrous interview! / []
He is a terrible liar! / []
At the start of the interview he looks composed and sounds reasonably articulate. By the end he looks like a child caught stealing sweets. A rambling, stuttering mess. Guilty as sin. / []
I’m sure he is sweating now 😂 / []
Funny how Virginia is suicided since this interview. / []
If he'd never been upstairs in Ghislane Maxwell's house, how could he tell the photo was taken upstairs? / ['Don’t be an ass. He could have been told it was ffs']
He has evil eyes. You can tell so much about a person through their eyes. / []

Interviewer on 🔥 / []
I don't believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide!! He was killed!! / []
13:42 - Shocked face "Really?"  Give this guy an Oscar / ['Right!']
Was Jeffrey Epstein the only influential person you had to learn something from after you left the navy?  It's not adding up!! / ['Not really. Very limited opportunities to learn how to abuse young girls in a discreet place.']
From prince to a weirdo pervy peasant. / []
The Royal family should be exempt from criminal and civil law including Murder. / []
This interview is an absolute comedy classic / []
Andrew has all the recollections of Jeffrey and meeting him on multiple occasions, but has no recollections of girls, etc. How can you be an environment with multiple people, especially teenagers, yet you claim not to know!! / []
Donald Trump must release the Jeffrey Epstein's file!! / []
Really? Did you really need to have slept over? Oh! Terrible! / []
13:40 wtffff / ['I can’t look😂 it’s so disgusting']
Stripped of his titles and kicked out of his house yesterday! Mad respect for Charles for doing the right thing! Something not happening in the US. RIP Virginia 😢 / []
The victim was found dead last year on claims she committed suicide. Jeffrey Epstein, the main perpetrator, was found dead in his cell, and they claimed he committed suicide. Before Virginia's death, she wrote a book. Why are they making this so big when everyone keeps dying unexpectedly? Virginia received an unspecified amount of money from the Royal Family as a settlement... and promised not to ever speak about this matter openly. Once news broke out that she was writing a book, she was found dead!! There's nothing here to celebrate! Andrew is going to be private to continue enjoying!! / []
Jeffrey did this because he knew he wasn't innocent!! Why did you go see him knowing he was already a convicted sex offender? / []
Lying rat / []
Andrew remembers everything, but seeing teenagers and evils!! / []
There was no hotel or anywhere else to stay? You had options but chose to stay at a convicted sex offenders home. How come you there for so long, and saw nothing? Sickening!! / []
Here we are 2025, it has taken this long! Pure Narcassist! Treated these girls as trash!  Pure EVIL!!!!!!!!! / []
99% of the time emily maitlis is utterly loathsome but ex-prince andy is so awful he managed to make her look good / []
Can someone put this piece of shxt mother fxcker out of his misery once & for all. Before he fxcks your pet or young child ??? Truth is he has a baby dxck & genital deceases. / []
He's so deluded with his royal privilage, that he truly believes we trust him. Take away his background and he comes off as a creepy, slimy, lying old man. / []
He was and still is a complete immoral and useless moron. He only managed to drag this out so long because he was mommy's  favorite son. now that is gone he is in the dustbin / []
a number of young females were seen leaving epsteins apartment that day, before their walk in the park.... go figure / []
The former Duke of York. He had 12 million quid. He gave it all to a girl he never met. And he didn't even sweat.  The former Duke Of York. He had twelve million quid.

Why does this never get old. / []
No longer “prince”.  Welcome to the real world, Andrew. Jail is next for you. / []
Get r Beethoven       Teeth / []
Question: Do i believe Prince Andrew what he says there ?  Answer YES   but then i do have the benefit of having seen many times over: GIRL you should have told me . Her ' i just did'  Me: TO LATE . I do no believe Andrew had any clew what was going on  IF he had sex with her i do not think he ever meant to hurt her Like he says in hindsight.  leave it to girls getting abused  To not tell who should know.  But only do so when it WAY to late . / []
the Queen's lawyers told Andy to avoid all journalists but he just couldn't help himself 😆 / []
Get rid of the whole royal family. N0nces / []

This is literally my 5th time watching this!!!! / []
This jerk is so belligerent.  I knew right after Andrew and his wife separated he became the worst son of the Queen.  This man is the worst liar we have gotten to known of the Queen’s favourite son,  He is rude, he swears at almost any and every one which I do believed he learned it from his father.  They think they can speak and disregard any and everyone.  I have heard with my own ears Andrew attended a meeting on behave of the Royals and he was in the worst mood and didn’t want to be there period.  He couldn’t wait to get the hell out of that meeting.  Why wouldn’t he just admitted it and speak the truth and get over it.  He sounds so  assanile. He was the biggest moron that lived on the Royal grounds. He is sinker himself deeper and deeper. Asked Meghan she would speak for any amount of money.  Do you remembered she asked Harry who is that man standing next to your grandmother?, and Harry replied oh that’s my Uncle, when she knew he was her one time lover. / []
" Just a straightforward shooting weekend" ... This man is a walking cliche / []
You do realize that their disgusting queen knew all of Andrew’s crimes and  didn’t want him to be held accountable. She’s was a monster / []
Four times a yeaaaaar…… guilty 👨🏿‍⚖️ / []
Suddenly developed a stutter, have we? 🙄 / []
Innocent royal guy... Very sad and so unfair... Wonderful person among his Royal brethren... / []
Never seen this I AM SHOCKED 😮😮 / []
Absolutely disgusting and hes a bad liar / []
This so call himself "honorable 🙃" is so sickening to listen to. Everything he says is clearly a lie.  Staying at the house with the just released from jail pedophile was convenient. And he needed two days to tell his friend that it wasn't appropriate to be seen together. This compulsive lier denied everything / []
He didnt know him that well but had to talk to him in person to say he couldnt talk to him😅 / []
Oh emily please review the grooming rape gangs. You've set a bar / []
He was being played?  He was being filmed! 🤫 / []
Burn in hell Andy. / []
What was the business about three and a half million people having a “badge”?

This is an interview of an interview of an interview, yet we are not certain if this a real interview. / ["Don't mean to be unbecoming, but I were having pizza in New York, the York part"]
Lol / []
Never seen this interview until now. My question is, if Epstein was a "plus 1" type of guest and Maxwell was the actual guest invited to Sandringham, Windsor, 18th birthday party, then WHY was it so important to see Epstein face to face in NY to break the friendship??? As a "plus 1"person, a phone call would have been sufficient to end friendship. So hypocritical ANDREW MOUNTBATTEN WINDSOR. / []
BYE BYE / []
perv / []
my goodness he is only being symbol-icky removed from crazy bad judgement to his titles so sad she does a good job of it . Why is public flogging no longer possible ? He deserves a lot worse than just having his phony stupid title removed how silly this whole thing is looks like a monty python skit  but sad to see you weak sad rat . / []
That lass killed her self for wot he done, how he not in jail is beyond me, its like jimmy savlie all over agen nout sed till he dead then it will all come out / []
40.37... would love to see Andrews at that moment... He lets out an audible laugh when Emily Says Epstein is Dead / []
He is such a liar…. It seems he almost believes what he’s saying. / []
This is so funny you can see he is not the brightest spark ....too much interbreeding  in all royal families / []
At some point, we all sit down to a banquet of consequences.  Enjoy your meal, Andrew. / []
What a guy . Luv ‘im. / []
Some lies right off the bat.   He said he left the mansion the next day after "breaking the friendship." The frienship that he said was really non-existent  because he was more Maxwell's friend. But then he stayed several more days. He said that he never had contact with him after that conversation. Yet, he came back for a dinner party while he was the guest of honor. Even if he wasn't the guest of honor, he went back after the breakup visit.  He says he doesn't know where the bar in Trance is. He's never been there. Then he said he doesn't drink. And then says  I he doesn't ever remember every buying a drink in Trance whenever he was there.  So those are lies that he told right out of the gate. That being said. Virginia Roberts was 17. The legal age of consent in England wad 16. So, he didn't break man's law, but he dod break God's law. And...so did she! / []
🎤🎼🎶🎶🎶🎶 Young girl, get out of my mind My love for you is way out of line Better run, girl You're much too young, girl / []

I would've asked him to remove his jacket to prove he doesn't sweat. Other than that, she didn't have to do much. / []
Good interview Prince Pinocchio !! 😅 / []
Surely the staff at Pizza Express or the parents giving the party could verify if he was there ? / []
The guy is a total idiot, isn't he? / []
He talked at the time, because Mossad warned him. Deflect, or we'll show them everything. / []
If you watch closely you can see his nose growing.😂😂😂 / []
It gets worse and worse as it goes on. "Funnily enough" / []
I’m back here after he’s just been bumped down to plain old Andy Mountbatten-Windsor, wondering how that ‘thick skin’ is doing. 😂 / []
His real name is Herr Battenburg Saxe Coburg and Gotha, by the way. The family is German. / []
Andrew Windsor lying his stupid head off, for all to witness. So hoping he ends up in court and then prison. If not, we must get rid of the whole vile family asap. They are nothing special, so why do we heap riches , privilege, and constant deference on them???? Kick the criminals out and let the UK people have the benefit of the land, property and priceless art these greedy bas---ds keep for ONE SINGLE FAMILY TO WALLOW IN, while UK poverty is getting worse every year! / []
That photo is real Epstein took it using a disposable camera you can see the flash in the mirror behind them,,he is a disappointment to his mother,,family and the world actually,,he is a reprehensible person a rapist a sexual abuser and a disgusting liar,,his fall from grace is deserved now he should be charged,, / ['Well said']
What a colossal joke this guy is preaching over something so disgusting and traumatising. / []
He’s fuckt up but will we be happy with him , putting a gun to he’s hed , think  , let’s him be / []
Who’s watching after he’s been stripped of being “Prince” Andrew / []
Still fresh in October 2025. / []
Whos here after the title was taken? lol / []
Anyone else watching this again after he’s just lost his title? Wow. Look at him just lying through his teeth. I also watched the interview by his ex body guards. He is a terrible human and deserves to be kicked out and jailed too! At least there’s some consequences for his actions now. Virginia has been vindicated 😢 / []
THIS , is the interview that finished him / []
The title needs to remove "Prince". / []
I think the prince had married with the wrong woman he could much more the nice educated a beautiful lady. His division was a bit mistake. Absolutely!!!!! / []
who is visiting this page after he was stripped of his Prince title in 2025? / []
good on bbc for keeping the comments enabled / []
You young lady, announce is too much asking an un necessary things...!!! You have think the second party's situation commonly!!! If the situation you will be very angry, won't you ? Be reasonable lady!!!! / []
why allow her to keep repeating the same questions...you let it become an interrogation you twit / []
Also the young girl agreed to do that for the monrey so noe what she is saying all of a sudden?  Everything is so strange!!!! / []
The Epstein and his girl friend were so bad devils they had so estrange jobs they did the evil man and woman they invited even X President Bill Clinton and the current Mr. President, Donald Trumpet as well!! What a horrendous they were!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭👹🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣🥴🥴 / []
Not a great liar, is he??? / []
He's the only man on earth who doesn't sweat. / []
He can’t …..t remember anything because he cannot sweat remember😮🥴🥊 / []
This interview didn’t age well for him😭 Prince no more / []
He nailed it. / []
Total liar and only deserves his stripping of titles. / []
I do this here in Canada I will be in jail for 20 years. / []
Rest in peace Virginia Giuffre. Tonight they stripped of his titles. / []
Well, Mr Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is now paying for all his lies and scurrilous and debauched lifestyle!! / []
Apparently, Andrew has developed a stutter. / []
The truth shall set you free. / []
Can't believe this was already 5 years ago / ['Time is moving fast since 2020.']
"we can not be seen together"   - "fancy a walk in the park?" / []
ANYONE WATCHIN THIS NOW HES BEEN STRIPPED ... UK is in a shambles atm / []
you can tell this mf has never had to take accountability before in his life / ['I agree! This is a textbook example of someone who has never faced accountability or consequences for anything at any time ever his whole life.']
😂😂😂 / []
12:35 prince Andrew’s biggest failing is he is just too honorable. / []
Prince no more! / []
So very convenient that Epstien is dead now. His mouth is permanently shut / []
'Never partied' He was called 'Randy Andy' back in the 90s lol 🤣. / []
Breaking news: Andrew stripped of 'prince' title and will move out of Royal Lodge 😂 / ['😊❤ God bless the King!!!!']
Did the "just a normal hunting weekend" involve bagging a few pesky proles? / []
Virginia 🌹🕯️ / []
This fool is now called Windsor... LOLOLOLOL / []
Andrew formally know as Prince 😅 Karma never loses an address . / []
He should’ve never done this interview, he looks even more guilty after this, It’s crazy that he has denied all wrongdoing even until now / ['@31:10 He knew he shot himself in the foot so many times and tried not to cry 🤣']
Finally, They stripped his title, his actions have tainted our royal family / []
HAHAHA!! He's not very bright,  is he? He's just throws himself in a hole and starts pulling dirt in on top of himself / []
Yup, this interview was definitely not scripted / []
This has to be one of the best interviews ever / []
A convenient place to stay.... Went to find out if he was in trouble. / []
Un fuffing believable whahahaahaa. This gold Jerry, GOLD! / []
"I brained on her rack.... er.... I racked my brain." / []
“I went there to tell him it would be inappropriate for us to be seen together” IS THIS COMEDY / []
Now officially the royal formerly known as prince, so the title needs updating. / []
She's is a great interviewer ... / []
Ha .. a letter would have done... / []
Oh! I see now! He is too honorable to not continue to be Epstein’s friend and get foot massages from children! I hadnt looked at it that way. Good lord he really has no belief that he will ever be held accountable. / []
He lies so much and so casually about something so serious that one has to wonder if all the royals are trained to be professional liars! 😮 / []
There was a character in Goodfella's called Jimmy Two Times , now we have Andy Two Times......repeating the same word TWICE constantly , total imbecile liar / []
What a ROYAL CREEP!! / []
Apparently Andrew wasnt present at this interview as he has no recollection  of it. He admits that it's him in the video but can't say if he was in the room with Emily or not.😂 / []
Whoever on his staff advised him to do this should never work again as an advisor of any sort. / ['beatrice was supporting him at the interview']
Randy Andy's claim that he didn't notice any questionable things going on while he stayed with Epstein, is like Rose West claiming she didn't know her husband was burying bodies under their house. / []
I hate him! He's nasty,  and pompous!  However  I love the Royal family  x / []
ANDREW IS A DISGUSTING,  DISGRACE! / []
28:52 This might be the biggest "gotcha" I've ever seen! / []
"Your friend suggests the photograph is fake"  "Ah you see there's a problem with that point...I have no friends" / []
Instead of trying to lie own up your actions and be inspirational share that it is human to have weaknesses. It’s human to miss use power it’s human to make mistakes and it’s human to have regret, and that’s the only way you can serve humanity and make any sense of your life. Don’t waste in playing these games of lies. It doesn’t serve you. / []
Don't ever worry about that job interview. It didn't go this badly. / []
On one hand, you make it sound like Epstein was behaving a certain way because of who you are, and on the other hand, you were sitting there in his living room, waiting to get an audience with him, so you went and stayed there for four days out of which you only got to see him for a few minutes… really???which side are you on? / []
Mr ambassador of the highest standards, I’m sorry to say that there are too many loopholes in your statements, when you were Maxwell‘s friend. Why would you not go and stay with her instead of staying with Epstein, and if he was not a close friend of yours and he didn’t have evidence against you. Why did you have to go for four days when you don’t even know the guy so well or what he’s up to? Why did you have to go all the way and stay with him for four days? just to tell him that you can’t be friends with him. Your movement is not simple and expensive. Why would you make that trip? Just to say to somebody who is not even your close friend that you don’t want to be, his friend - doesn’t make sense. The only option you have is to be honest and honour the woman that you have offended from the space that you didn’t know any better. You have this great opportunity of a life to become a better person. Don’t waste it by lying because you’re lying to nobody except yourself and that being a prince, you have to lie to yourself is very infitting very dishonourable and it’s really not holding the highest standards. I’m sorry. Please come out in the open and say what has happened. It’s not a crime. It’s human nature for centuries. Men have behaved like this, so you are not an exception, and you’re not a monster it’s just normal for somebody in your position to do what you’ve done, so there is no need to lie. Just be honest for once, and don’t make a mockery out of Virginia‘s life and her death. / []
Where are all the ‘usual suspects’ comments? 😂😂😂 / []
RIP Virginia Guiffre 🙏 / []
ALL their LET'S PLAY SOON is coming to the LIGHT. BLESS all the children! / []
At least bill Clinton owned up to his mess / []
I am not British. I don’t live in the UK. But I watched this interview several times. It’s famous all over the world. Very concerning, yet fascinating content, to say the least. / []
The sweating comment is the best!   Please!  🤣🤣🤣 / []
Lost Souls. Dark Secrets InThe Dungeon Of The British Empire Starting With Your King Present King ,Whose Morals Are In a he Psyche Who Killed The The Qweethe Qween zof England By F.Moral Issues With The ZZ Hirsey zCamils. F. asa / []
what the actual f did I just watch / []
Remember folks, just because they're born 'royals' does not make them special. They sh*t and p*ss like the rest of us, and like a lot of heads of state / politicians, are as corrupt as they believe they can get away with. Amazing he thought these answers would exonorate him 😂😂😂😂 / []
Wonder where he gets his victims from now / []
Such a vague performance from a man who's nothing but an arrogant liar.  I think it's very possible either he or Clinton are complicit with the convenient deaths of Epstine & Vaginia... / []
I knew what the things were to look for,but I never saw them,he was to busy doing them. / []
Que tipo tan mentiroso / []
Can't watch this bullshit any more / []
You make me sick you sit there shirt and  collar so no one see you swallow  a guilt / []
This is so cringey 😂 it’s painful to watch / []
I dont know where the bar is in Tramp then goes on to say I have never bought  a drink while at Tramp 😂 Remembers nothing but remembers a pizza he had years and years ago, he has obviously got a way with lying from birth so sees nothing wrong with any of what he’s said and why nothing is believable whatsoever / []
Fkin hell this guy stinks of guilt / []
A stupid delusional man who thinks he's smarter than everyone else. / []
The "royals" are a joke and antiquated at best. Here's your proof.  I'm surprised he's not wearing 50kg of fake participation medals on his coat / []
You  have ganged o up rn him   bur he is not  alone. Stay strong. / []
nothing coming out of his mouth except spluttering and stuttering , absolute buffoon / []
Just to be clear , there is NOTHING "honorable" about taking liberties with what was basically a 17yo child that is THE Crux of this awful awful mess and going on national tv and lying about it , all lies he has no honor none / []
You 🤬 idiot . The problem is we are not idiots. Pedophile / []
He’s a slimy worm 🐛 / []
All lies. Mean dirty evil person . / []
Scum bag. / []
as a man you need to make a positive act - okay / []
His mother died of shame after realising her son was a peadofile. / []
Itd be nice if he just opened up and spilled the beans. We all wanna know.  Tbh people would probably praise him for telling the truth about it all. / []
The problem is everybody thinks they are a good person / []
Nearly every ol boy doctor I've met is like this. / []
“Tendency to be too honorable”…. Right-o…😮 / []
Member of the British royal family was so poor he couldn't afford a hotel room—Epstein's home was most convenient for him. What a clown. / []
This was the downfall of the British Monarchy / []
ANDREW SILENCED EPSTEIN  AND MANNY OTHERS ,HOW MANNY MORE IS HE GOIN TO SILENCE? / []
WHO IS WE? / []
HOW DOES HE KNOW IT WAS TAKEN UPSTAIRS? / []
When when when  the the the😂 / []
Um um um / []
The the the / []
WHAT A MOCKERY,! / []
Lie detector expert required, the one who analysed the lying McScams. / []
Release the files!!!!! / []
This interview is brilliant, how she just lets him embarrass himself with pathetic misleads😂 He’s so obviously uncomfortable with the questions being asked, I don’t really see how anyone watching this can truly believe that this man is innocent. / []
What a pathetic Royal. The use of “umm” as every other word is ridiculous. / []
Moron / []
11 minutee 48 seconds the facade slips / []
14:08 Oscar worthy / ['😂😂🤣🤣']
So believable. / []
This just gets so much worse over time. / []
100% lying through his teeth….! Being a Royal doesn’t excuse a lying sex offender….Why isn’t he in jail? / []
🤥 🗑️ 🤥 / []
Thé Duke of Hazard. / []
Such horseshit... / []
What a liar / []
Human parasite / []
Epstein is dead    ...... he chuckles!!! Wtf, however evil E was, apparently they were friends and probably fukbuddies!!! / []
If he took a lie detector test, he would fail on everything he has said in this interview. Period / []
The only moment that you need to watch is 36:30. Will you testify under oath? If he was innocent, the answer would be an immediate YES. Instead he nearly chokes on his own dodgy response. He paid her off rather than going to trial. If someone was accusing me of something as horrible as this, I would go to trial, not a doubt in my mind. / []
Tendency to be too honourable!!!! ok, sex offender!!!! / []
If you slow down the video,  you can see into his eyes and  facial expression that he's absolutely lying. / []
Comment from outside the UK ... is it likely that Prince Andrew can be taken to court? / []
When she began the interview and asked why he decided to talk now, he should have said "Because there is never a good time to tell the world that I am a PEDOPHILE, but it's the right thing to do." His smugness is REPUGNANT! / []
28:08 smiling when hearing a victim testimony? Pure evil / []
He doesn't even break a sweat 😂😅 / ["He can't sweat 😂"]
Ha ha! Randy Andie is a bad liar! / []
What a wild life … getting do whatever you want with unlimited money and ass kissing . He choose to have sex with underage girls instead . Insane / []
You don't need to think if you are telling the truth / []
Jail he should get !! / []
If he wasn’t part of the corrupt royal family, he’d be in jail. How was he still accepted by the royal family?  Shows what a bunch of idiots they are. / []
Harry and Andrew are a joke.....they should be cut off totally....Harry is even worse / ['You see a man who most likely r*ped minors, how is Harry worse? Be serious', '@aguti7920exactly!']

Blink, blink, blink, lie lie shifting eyes / []
Was Prince Andrew the only one she was paid to sleep with ? / []
Rat family,  paedophiles, nazi's, leaches,  arrogant bare faced liars. / []
What a joke😂😂😂feel so sorry for the victems 😢😢you / []
I’m sorry but if Andrew is not in jail, the monarchy should be abolished! This whole sage of peeeedofile  coverup is really disgusting! No accountability at all! / []
Royals are irrelevant. Waste of money, Dodgey and allegedly corrupt. Get rid of them. / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j1ZcGKoJcU / []
It is okay for Prince Andrew   to stay in England but i dont think he should visit the USA  otherwise he will be arrested / []
Dirty dirty old man / []
Boy ohh gosh WOW !! UMPH!! MY GUT IS CRINCHING IN!!DIFFICULT TO ANSWER !?!??? WHAT?? IS THIS A ROYAL ..?? PROTCOL???? GOSHHHHID HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY..HMM HE SEEMS VERY UMMM NERVOUS..I DUNNO / []
19:39 of course you don’t, because you’ve never bought your own drinks or lifted a finger for yourself. / []
Rewatching this  after " piers uncensored" today . WOW / []
Aaaa I do not believe this Prince is being Honest...I simply can't believe..that he would stay there at all or even look upon Epstein face ..To be a Prince ..and remain social period with a child rapist is Most Despicable Prince or commoner PERIOD !! / []
In light of the leaked 2011 'we're in this together' email to Epstein this hasn't aged well / []
I'm so noble I flew across the world to tell my friend, who wasn't a close friend at all, (just another friend's plus one really) to tell him that I shouldn't be seen in public in his company..and I took a walk in public in his company to do that.. and I stayed in his house for 4 days.. Yeah, right. Makes perfect sense. / ['😂', '👍👍👍']
Andrew: "I have the tendency to be too honourable" 😅 / ["He's so honourable"]
That journalist doing the interview deserves a big reward for keeping a straight face during all of Andrews BS , Its hysterical. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes / []
Prince Andrew said that was him in the photograph but not his hand., so whose hand was it.? I know , it was THING from the Adams family . / []
The Queen must of been yelling .CAN SOMEONE PUT A GAG OVER HIS MOUTH QUICK / []
This person suffers from amnesia to every question asked! Douchebag / []
Hey Prince Andrew, if you read this, you were better off just admitting it or just flat out lying / []
I don’t sweat…yeah right!  You were sweating your butt off!  😅 / []
Opportunities to learn? Learn what? To do things to minors. Completely insane. / []
Prince Andrew is the kind of friend  you want always in your corner.he was a constant friend of Mr.Epstine even when he was arrested / []
To quote Blackadder... It started off badly, tailed off a bit in the middle, and the less said about the end the better. / []
Literally croaking at the idea of taking the oath / []
Man this f****** guy stutters more than he actually speaks / []
He’s got the look of doom all over his face. / []
Why does he keep speaking in a third person he keeps saying we don't think this or we don't think that like he can't stand up like a man and say I he got a brain other people into the situation with him absolutely pathetic is a 60 year old with a 16-year-old mind just been spoiled his whole f****** life he's never had to answer for a thing that he's done and you can tell by how he is reacting in this interview he's failing miserably / []
I've never heard so much stuttering in my life I mean this guy is just getting knocked all over the place / []
Can we say plausible deniability / []
I think I will say I was there I only seen him maybe once passing in the passage😅 / []
You know this conveniently he is washing the royal family of the whole thing he's making it very clear that this is only him not as has anything to do with the rest of the Royal Family I don't think any I don't think this interview could have went any worse / []
Oh Emily, would you mind calling me Randy? / []
HES SUCH A LIAR!!! / []
Watching this now in 2025. At 12:30 he says he “has a tendency to be too honorable”. / []
the more he rambles on, the deeper he is digging his own grave / []
What a dumb ass, lock him up. / []
Bet he is swetting now. / []
I... I.... I....admit fully that...that my judgement was probably coloured by my... um...tendency to be honourable and not have my way with the many underaged girls that were surrounding  me, because apart from them not being there, I do not have a penis.....it was shot off in the Falklands war. / []
This guy should be behind bars, Scum / []
Royal are finally now known as royal.. “The prince” is actually a disgusting……. / ['Sorry I forgot 🇮🇪']
LMAO 😅😅😅 / []
It was a shooting weekend a simple shooting weekend,well here in Liverpool we always have them and it would have been nice if these 3 spoilt brats had attended one / []
Leave him alone / []
Im so sick of hearing about this awful man.kick him and fergie out of royal lodge and make them go and fend for themselfs.and give them both nothing.he and Fergie are awful and liers. / []
He had an extrondinary way of getting people together...😢 / []
Doing this interview is the answer. / []
The walk in the park … if only an audio recording exists of that conversation… / []
In Germany we have a saying „talking is silver, remain silent is gold“ ….. what a fool this ridiculous little man is … sooooo low / []
She prepared well and an excellent example of the patience of the greatest fisherman waiting watching giving line … then suddenly the big pluck of the line and hook the fish … flapping on dry ground … gasping for air / []
I didn’t sweat at the time. 😂 / []
21:40 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
He says funny enough when asked question about Jeffrey and ghislaine what’s funny enough he’s a lier 😂 / []
This is a great case study into the ticks and mannerisums of a liar while under the microscope  The FBI can use this a case study on how people lie and the stories they build to support the lie / []
An absolute joke / []
He screams liar / []
NSPCC ANDREW a paedophile / []
Why he doesn't remember anything has he got demensia ? / []
LIAR LIAR  LIAR. Proven liar in 2025 but we knew back in 2006 / []
He always has been an ugly, rotten, degenerated parasite like most of british royals. / []
Proven now to be a bare faced liar! He should do the RIGHT and HONOURABLE thing and clear off out of the UK altogether taking his EX wife with him. Divorced for how long and she thinks she’s entitled to a house on the Windsor Estate - if it happens you can be sure she’s got a whole lot of dirt to throw / ['Long live prince andy']
You can tell he is lying, this interview was a PR stunt, so many leading questions. / []
What a dirty and despicable man! He should man up and admit he did it! Nobody believes him ! / []
Not my King and certainly not anyone's prince! / []
Disgrace / []
Pukchet thailand patong beach 98 ,i c it ,iwas 16 and he deff perv / []
There is a certain group of people that tries really hard to benefit from ignorance, however,  insist on being known as the superior group.  This always amuses me  😊 / []
i have no recollection of having recollections about recollections i thought i recollected but remembered i did not recollect ....by the way - who are you madam , also - who am i and where am i??? / []

Lying through his teeth / []
Biggest liar / []

Guilty. How he is not behind Bars is beyond me / []
what a muppet..... hahahahaha - this is comedy gold / []
Watch this every now and then, still top tier television after this long 🤘 / []
LYING PRICK...if he has any balls / []
I “smell” lies. A lot of stammering, eyebrow creases, blinking… You be lyin little “Prince” / []
I can’t believe this was 5 years ago / []
Perfect example of someone who has never lived in the real world and doesnt know how to sound remotely convincing when they are lying.. the funny thing is, he probably thought he was bossing this interview 😂 / []
Why did he think a child sex offender needed the grace of an explanation as to why someone no longer wishes to have contact......some things dont need to be explained......why did he think he deserved an explanation / []
I've never witnessed someone use so many words to say so little......astonishing 🤷   The way he constantly says the dates WE have is so obviously him trying to distance himself from the situation and involve other people so it becomes a WE problem and not a HIM problem / []
"21:42" is my favorite part of this hilarious interview........ / []
I just wanna say how much I like Emily maitlis.  She's fricking lethal / []
"But you'd notice if there were loads of underage girl wandering..."  Interrupts "God yes, I always notice he underage girls."  * sits back thinking good point Andy, you made a good point. * / []
Hence the support of the Zionist state in its genocide,They are all compromised and not fit for office / []
My new best word RECOLLECT!! / []
Just amazing to know that most these politicians royalty are compromised and blackmailed by Epstein and co.but hey look over there Its the mozlimz! / []
all the talk around epstein and maxwell , sex crimes and they have only found one person guilty in the whole world, which the media are riding for all it's worth, is absolutely absurd . if is the that all the law enforcement around the world can come up with then release maxwell. what a joke. i suppose that is more than in the puff daddy case. / []
Amazing that immediately afterwards he thought this went well.  Proving he’s not only a sleazeball, but a moron as well. / []
Andrew saying he can't sweat is the funniest thing he's ever said in this interview😂 / []
Creep / []
There is a tape of him doing this somewhere / []
The Prince of Weasels.  Edit: The Weasel formerly known as. / []
This guy is a lying dog / []
Six years on, and with the death of Virginia Giuffre (RIP), the situation has worsened for him both inside the Royal Family and with the public in general. / []
It’s the same question asked 30 ways / []
Fantastically bad liar, eh? / []
Even more of a car crash interview than I remember at the time! 😂  Emily is as sharp AF. / []
So this guy got chosen to be the sacrifice. He,like the rest of us has a breaking point or a limit as to how much punishment he will take before he snaps. When he does,then we can expect to hear the names of Epstein's  clients & all the disgusting things that they engaged in. He's got the dope on alot of people. They are his friends. / []
HOW BIZARRE AND VERY CONVENIENT THAT SOMEONE HIGH UP IN ROYAL FAMILY AND BEING AS BRAINLESS AS YOU FINALLY GOT TOLD THAT YOU GOT PLAYED BIG TIME AND DID YOUR LEGAL PEOPLE TELL YOU TO PAT OUT £20 million like a winning lottery ticket winner you know what you did monster 👿 resolve it sensibly by getting your mother to sign a check for a massive amount of tax payers money so we the people paid for you being the monster you are.👺 / []
This just shows his level of entitlement. He spouts so many lies and thinks everyone will believe him. A total bafoon with everyone laughing at him behind his back. He shouldn't be given Frogmore and Sarah Ferguson can fix her own place. I'm sure there's a 2 bedroom apartment in Swansea that'll suit her. / []
I never sweat (the inability to sweat is called anhidrosis and being shot at has never caused it to happen) that photo was obviously doctored. This interview shows the utter contempt this man has for the British public. How or why her majesty the queen would favour this man is beyond me. / ['She probably believed his lies']
weak, spoiled, dull, entitled, brutish and a liar.  let’s make him royalty! i hope the Brits finally wake up and put an end to the antiquated sanctioned scam that is the monarchy. / []
Hello darkness my old friend / []
Andrew is a lier and a selfish pig.we all need to get rid of this awfull person. / []
Prince piece of shxt is now demanding a house for him & one for Fergy at tax payers expense to move out out of his castle residents. he should be in a prison sell. / []
Agreed - social media allows us to understand what has been covered up before. / []
I do things in collaboration with each other.  Delusional. / []
Andrew now reduced to fxcking the dead or blow up dolls & teddy bears ? That really suits the mutt. Maybe King egghead will help him if he fxcks his left leg & queen Camzilla ? / ['😂😂😂', 'King Tampon and Queen Horseface/Leatherface, take your pick 🤣']
We all knew him —- why introduce him to your daughters???? / []
This proves the government and the police are corrupt he's clearly lying and he's not in jail, little wrongen / []
Masterclass in interview skills. Superb. / []
His tie says it all / []
He doesn’t have the money to book a private room through the palace at a hotel?  He could not be seen, that’s WHY he stayed with Epstein. / []
"My judgement was coloured by my tendency to be too honourable" aww he admits everything / []
He needs to go to trial / []
Always other people just like politicians. Haaaa haaaa. Your mother bailed you out and chucked you out. Comical rat / []
His answer to the question at 16.45 is truly unbelievable / []
Wow, this did not age well at all. / []
Liar. To say the least. Gobsmacked here. / []
I've stepped on a rusty nail in bare feet and it was less painful than this / []
Stay tuned for the next episode of NEANDERTHUGS GONE WILD (Deuteronomy 28:68, Job 9:24, Proverbs 29:2, Habakkuk 2:4-12 KJV). / []
“I got the nickname Randy Andy, because of my too honorable nature”. / []
Wasn’t close to Epstein at all, yet stayed at all of his houses, his island, flew on the Lolita express, invites him to his daughters birthday, as one Royal or average person does with people one barely knows. Sure….. and the blinking he does…. His eyelids are stroboscopic in their flashing. The arrogance of that man? A birthday party for a Gislaine ? No, certainly not it ! It was a shooting weekend 😂. No, it wasn’t a diner party where I was the guest of honor, I was there and there were only ten of us there 😂😂😂 / []
So let's make contact so I can tell you we can't make contact / []
absolutely no indication... but if there was .... lol / []
"You had your arms around her waist in the photo"  "Well you see you have to understand something, I don't have any arms, or at least I didn't at the time." / ['😂😂😂😂 good one', 'Absolutely lies 😂', '😂']
Why would he use Epsteins houses in the US?   He lives in the UK and if he was visiting the US on official business his itinerary and accomodation would already be booked.  He really is a bit weird in his answers.  His nickname as a young man was ‘randy Andy’.  You don’t get a nickname like that for nothing.   You don’t get invited to Royal party without official approval.  He is such a liar.  How did he know that photo was taken upstairs?   He is digging his own grave. / []
0 he said that he doesn't sweat. I bet after this interview he was sweating his tail off / []
Excellent interviewer! / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j1ZcGKoJcU  This interview with his security guard is gold. The ex-prince is a flaming piece of garbage. Flaming! / []
A straightforward shooting weekend.... / []
“My judgement was clouded by how honourable I am” 😂 / ['lol', 'Astonishing', 'Yeah that got me too 😂', '🤦🏻\u200d♀️🤮', 'So honourable that he doesn’t regret his friendship with Epstein']
Ahora que lo veo para unir ideas de cuando fue esta entrevista y lo que esta pasando ahora  . Dice una y otra vez que no volvió a tener contacto con el, y ahora siendo Octubre 2025  resulta  que publican  correos entre Sara y Epstein (ahora ex duquesa) que lamentando que Epstein esta en prisión etc. Asi que hasta la ex sabia de su relación cercana con Epstein, tal ves  hasta ella iba a ésas orgías, resultando lesbiana??.  Adicional ahora Andrés resulta que tenia un espia Chino... y negocios obscuros.. Salio un perfecto delincuente de corbata.  Lo que me indigna es que la Corona en ese tiempo la Reina Isabel  , que yo la tenía en estima(ahor ya no) , tapo y pago todo le hizo su hijo mimado y consentido.  Ahora el Rey Carlos lo mismo, deberian dejar que se vaya a la cárcel su hermano para asi salvar la poca dignidad  corona, porque asi lo van a sacar y que termine un reinado de una vez.  Bastante mala reputación tiene Carlos con haberse casado con su amante a pesar de que sus hijos le hayan pedido que no lo haga.   Por mi que a toda esta familia, monarquía ( solo los niños  y  niñas pequeñas no) les parta un rayo , o les los exilien, porque no valen la pena. / []
He's a liar!! / []
I've watched this once a year for the past 5 years. I'll keep watching it until the day I die. Unreal TV. / []
I spent.my.young.life.in.children's homes in.the late.70s.and.80s..i was abused by people.of.higher.class.i.am now.a.older and.more.street.wise person. This.man.is.not.telling.the.whole.truth. / ['O.k.']
He doesn’t sweat / ['He didn’t sweat, he may do now']
What a clown / []
Oh wow!  He actually thought people would believe this? 😮😮 / ['Mmmmmm']
What a fat liar! If you weren’t close to Epstein then why bother to see him in person? Plus as a working royal you said you have seen him trice in a year. As a normal person, I don’t even have time to meet with friends and if ever I have time I will prioritized my closes friend and that’s exactly what you did! / []
His mental health is being affected?!?🤬 / []
I am at the 10 minute mark and cannot go 9n. This is the worst cringe I have ever ever felt. Onntop of just how blatently this guy is lying. OMG. I did watch when it came out but didn't remember as so damned bad.   Scurry away to some obscure place, Andrew. Clean for others, cook for them, carry them to the toilet if needed. And even humble service works won't fully make up for your horrid depraved arrogant entire adult life so far. / []
Why is the disgusting creature not in prison is beyond me. World is run by Pedos, I’m sure of it!!😭 / []
Dirty nonse. / ['Hmmmm']
This was so bad!! 😖He sounds like my son when I ask him if he was the one who ate the candy bar I left in front of him.🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
If there ever was a reason to get rid of the monarchy, he’s it. Freakin’ sicko. / ['Yeah it is so ridiculous. Pretty sure William will be the last King.']
Extra comment.  Bone in his neck?  Hmmm. Narrative control. Let’s see if this comment stays.  We see you. / []
Rope a Dope / []
"I never went upstairs. And I know that photo is upstairs because I know exactly what the upstairs of her house looked like. Because I have never been there" / ['Yup😂', 'I laughed so hard at this comment I had tears rolling down my face 🤣🤣']
Mr Andrew: "Its not fair! its complete nonsense!  I don't recall anything!! They are liars all of them!! What should I do??"  Mr Andrew's assistant: "You should go on TV and tell the whole world then. After all, you're so persuasive and smart Mr Andrew sir".  Mr Andrew: "Yaah I shall do so, I shall say that Mr Epstein's hise was more like a train station where I maybe passed him in the passage".  Mr Andrew's Assistant: "Yes Mr Andrew, Yes!! I shall prepare you your favourite black suit and start polishing your shoes sir Mr Andrew".  Mr Andrew: "Yaah! Get polishing!!!" / []
Imagine being accussed of sleeping with a trafficked 17 year old and your response is: "I have no recollection of that" / ['Age of consent.', 'Especially as he abused her on 3 different occasions']
Lies. Lies sicko pervert  you should be locked up / []
Priceless Moment  13:40 / ['😂']
this is so painful to watch !!!!!!!! just keep digging his own hole / []
What a liar / []
He’s broke his mother’s heart, may the Queen……RIP. / ['She covered for him. The day after the photo was released with Andrew and Virginia, the queen gave him another honour. Pathetic, she raised a MONSTER.']
“All things associated”.  We now know those “things” were underage sex toys and everything else was probably a lie. / []
My goodness, this is so embarrassing to watch…😳 / []
Hes lying omg hes lying LOL So he needs security for protection but can stay at Epsteins "railroad station" where people come & go constantly? / ["Lol, I didn't even think of that, but good point!"]
The Royal firm have thrown him under the bus this time for the purpose of distraction and elimination.  The whole system of oppression should be disbanded / ['😮']
*You Visited The Palm Beach Residence 4 Times A Year? - NO I Did Not - So How Many Times Would You Say You Did Visit In Total? - About 4 Times* 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
'I was too honourable'. Being honourable is about being honest and acting with integrity. He says we was too honourable in this interview and then gives us the no sweating and pizza Express story. / ['Honor. Yeah  not honor when touching those that can’t be drafted, vote, sign for legal contracts.']
When he says "My tendency to be more honourable". Good grief, this man. / ['😭😭']
underestimating the interviewer would be a fatal mistake, she is very pointed and making sure he goes on lying and faking and she has a smirk on her face. she is very sophisticated and ruthless at the same time, beating him at his own game. / []
look at him hum and haw and invent lies after lies and make up scenarios, he scrunches his eyebrows when he cooks with his brain.contradicting himself hahahhahahahahah / []
God he is such a liar! Lmmfao 😂 / []
It's good to see the Anglosphere's sense of humor is still intact - and amply displayed in the comments section of this page. 😆🤣 / ['😊']
Amazing interviewer. The outcome is an absolutely outrageous and embarrassing picture of this person / []
What is this nonsense? Chuck him in prison, most criminals don’t get a bbc interview to lie about their crimes. / []
He fucked this up now didn't he? The funny thing is, he never once praised them? / []
This interview was supposed to make Andrew look good..ummmmh but the average guy is not stupid. With so many people  close to Andrew saying other things. / []
Maybe he should get a job at Jackcanory … his face screams lies 👍👍 / []
They walked together in the park because it was one of the few places which wasn't bugged. / []
What you are witnessing here is a very low IQ fool who the establishment tried desperately to educate. They did the best they could but when he's on his own he is pathetic. / []
Pizza express please / []
I would of loved to of been a fly on the wall around Andrew when this was released as by all accounts straight after the interview they were all high fives each other. / ['It shows how disconnected from reality they are that they finished the interview and thought, "Nailed it!"']
As Emily questions the judgement of Andrew to physically go and stay with Epstein after his conviction, I was thinking to myself "He had to, any other way would be the chicken's way!!". Glad Andrew pointed that out. / []
What a lying scumbag. / []
5 years ago and still kicking... / []
If he had never been upstairs in the house, how did he know that's where the photo was taken? 🧐 / []
at this point, Andrew saying "I think that on the photo that was taken, you can eve see a cartoon bubble with me saying "I came here to breakup this friendship." ". / []
I have a feeling he is lying through his teeth / []
The way he mentions that he went to meet Epstein to say they couldn’t been seen together anymore tells you the truth.  He didn’t go to say I want nothing to do with you, he said they couldn’t been seen together anymore. There is a big difference / []
Prince wank😅 / []
Just goes to show that people who think of themselves as the upper class have no real intelligence, this man has to be the biggest idiot to think he could lie his way out of this mess he created. / []
Prince Andrew was the dinner guest of honour, where had had a 15 year old... bottle of wine. Sure.... / []
I have no time for the Windsor family and him particularly, but I find no evidence against him. Powerful people attract enemies and he clearly has some vociferous ones. / []
Interviewer - “ How did you and Jeffery Epstein come across each other ?   Prince Andrew - “ through his girlfriend !!! :) / []
How to dig a deep deep whole,  just keep on talking with bottomless arrogance . / []
Andrew’s lustful “I can’t wait to ‘play’ again” email to Epstein, places this desperate interview in its rightful context as a hapless tool of deception. / []
Reading the comments, now in 2025 and how they make me smile. / []
It's extraordinary that the firm let him give this interview. I would have had him locked in the tower / []
Rat trap....just set the trap for the rat and it will eventually get caught in the trap... / []
Is Spitting Images still a thing ?  If not they could have a field day with this monumental 🤡 / []
NO SWEAT!!  LMFAO / []
He’s not lying with cunning malice. he’s lying to himself and we’re watching that inner delusion collapse live on camera. / ["That's what makes this interview so painful yet fascinating to watch. He uses"]
I believe you, Virginia Guiffre. Rest in peace. ❤️ / ['😢 Poor Virginia. Justice for the victims!', 'RIP Virgina 🙏🏻🕊', 'She was def underage HOWEVER she knew exactly what she was getting into.', '@Lukesky5917Andrew is scum however Virginia knew exactly what she was getting into. She is and was never innocent regarding her "duties" for Epstein', '@HannadayFLO Really?']
This Buffoon has supported for over 20 yrs the dictatorial regime of Bahrein.  What this prick does  in bed it is just the tip of an iceberg. / []
The bed time story / []
What a disaster for Andrew, he just kept digging a deeper hole as the interview went on / []
"if you're a man.... it's a positive action"...... / []
@24:33 he didn't go upstairs but he recognizes the upstairs. So many inconsistencies. / []
Best question would have been. Have you ever had sex in any of his properties? Yes or No? Period! / []
He's telling just enough truth thinking he'll get away with the biggest lies. He's an idiot. / []
If you wanna see the most sinful look...look no further then @ 8:18 minute mark. / []
Now with what’s going what a sick individual / []
Liar / []
That wasn’t a foot massage if you get my drift / []
Him and our President are the same type of arrogant , narcissistic ass holes and they just happen to be good friends with Epstein 😮 / []
Thilthy lier / []
There is no hole deep enough for this guy to be put in, narcissistic scumbag / []
Lying bustid / []
Fvcking paedophile and should be facing justice! / []
If he did it then why isn’t there more evidence? I don’t think he did. / []
Ahhh, you see ,I couldn't have had a foot massage from a Russian teen .... because,  you have to remember,  at that time...... I didn't have any feet. / ['Over here chuckling 😂', 'He lost his feet in the Falklands!', "@Rebecca-oh5yh It's worse than that.  He hasn't got a leg to stand on. !!", '...and only since then, certain things have happened that have enabled him to, have feet.']
Liar Liar Pants On Fire 😂 / []
The entire royal family are AI. Wise up, fools. / []
*_Kudos to Emily Maitlis. She played him like a fiddle_* / []
Knoe I whole heartedly believe he had a role in his death 💯 / []
I don't believe him at all / []
"4 times a year" really  No that never happened / []
Leave them alone...just coz he got caught...poor guy / []
"I dont remember or recollect that photo being taken" Yet "that photo was taken upstairs" / []
HAHA FARKEN LOL, This is hilarious!! / []
If he was NEVER there in the "photograph" with Virginia, then how did he know the picture was taken upstairs?  Also, she asked him "do you think the photo is fake then?"  HE NEVER SAID "NO!!!"  He said, "I can't confirm whether it's real or fake."  REALLY???  Well, if I claimed I was NEVER there, then my answer would/should be, "yeah it's fake," but he NEVER SAID THAT.  A LOT of "squirming" from this guy.... / []
I've seen this before; he's NOT "very convincing" AT ALL.....😒😒😒 / []
Lie after Lie after Lie / []
Does his 72 bears get questioned too?? Liol / []
Obviously a liar, dragged out.? Pompous arse! No kings, no princes. Same law for all! / []
He paid her off because he knew he was guilty and a trial  would prove him Guilty.   He hasn"'t fooled anyobe. RANDY Andy you seriuosly need professional help. / []
Hey Andrew I don’t believe a word you’re saying.  The media needs to STOP protecting pedifiles!!!! / []
This was a man who has had prostitutes in his life. These women would come and go.  Now he s been more  exposed as a pervert. / []
This was a man who has had prostitutes in his life. These women would come and go.  Now he s been more  exposed as a pervert. / []
Worst interview from him, ever.maitlis was brilliant / []
210 lier. 2011 he  messsged or spoke to him.😊 / []
"I went to see him to tell him we can't be seen together" ... "So we went for a walk in the park" / ['😂😂😂😂😂', 'A phone call would have sufficed']
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. / []
A "cosmopolitan group of PEDOPHILES."  🙄🙄🙄 / []
Sends a mail to Epstein about looking forward to playing again…..euch / []
Fabricating his daughter in the lie..now his daughter knows her father has been raping children. / []
And strangely Virginia “ has taken her life “ exactly like Epstein … curious indeed. / []
This piece of work has 2 daughters …. / ["And he's probably done them both"]
"It wasn't possible because I was home with the children."  Whose children was he with? / []
💥 L 💥 I 💥 A 💥 R💥 THST’S WHO ANDREW IS💥 / []
“It was a convenient place to stay “ The son of the Queen of England does not have somewhere else to stay ? / []
Are you the late queens favourite son? Queen Elizabeth!! Sorry, i ve no  re_collectioion of who Queen Elizabeth 2nd is. No, i m convinced i ve never met Queen Elizabeth.. / []
"The photograph was taken upstairs and I don't think I ever went upstairs" / []
Poir Andly. Lol. He  doean't know what he s saying. He s actually beluwves what he aaying. A compulsive lier. Poor Andy. Its clear he needs lot  and lots more professional  help. Its clear he s not observant not to suspect his friend or extremely stupud.  Maybe, a combination of thte two. He clearly believes his own lies. / []
His work is to make sure he gets more&more money for him and his close family. NOTHING ELSE. / []
Minupulitive and a lier. Not very bright, and having degrees wtc. It doesn't mean anything. Thick, thick and thick. Thats putting it polietly. He s juat privildged. No  idea he a hanging himself. / []
If that was anybody else apart from royalty, they would be put in jail. I don’t know why they get away with it. They’re humans at the end of the day and he violated a child. / ['Maybe not "human" after all???  🤔🤔🤔']
Vile slimeball / []
He is such a bad liar / []
I cannot stop watching this interview,  he really is the most shameless egocentric delusional entitled lying sack of sht ive ever seen , absolute oxygen thief , go away you sad thing just go away and take your teddy 🧸 bears with you, disgusting 🫣 😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉 / ["He's worse than that."]
So unconvincing. / ['And unbecoming.']
Collaborate and give those young girls back their childhood. / []
Who is here in October 2025? Especially after the Paul Page interview / []
"but hé had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together" 1:54 / ['Yeah, a "cosmopolitan group of PEDOPHILES!!!"  😱😱😱']
Wow and this guy doesen't even blush🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️shame on you!!!! / ['According to him, he "doesn\'t sweat" either.  🙄🙄🙄']
This is painful to watch. / []
13:50 / []
Extremely iffy family, the saxe coburg gotha. / []
Who is he sir g I love you prince / []
"He had an extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together, that's what I remember most about him."   Uh, yeah, not that hard to gather a bunch of pedophiles and rapists when you're providing victims en masse. / []
When you hand Andrew a shovel 😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
I am no  body language expert, but hear me out. He is lying out of his pores. He is so very uncomfortable it's painful and amusing to watch.  A MASTERCLASS on what NOT to do when caught in a scandal. / []
‘My judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be TOO honourable’…try again mate / []
He goes into such depth about his overthinking his past behavior to try remember ..... what a moral uostanding guy. 🤣🤣 growing up a prince in line to the throne no one will say no to you and you think you're the cleverest manipulator. Dude is like a 5 yr old getting caught stealing.  He just cant shutup long enough to save himself more embarrassment. / []
The fotografe is there. He can’t prove it is fake. Now is just to accept the facts. If you don’t remember . There is a picture to remember yoi. / []
The royal layer . / []
Poor Virginia 😢 her life was destroyed by these pdf's. He probably doesn't remember her because there were 100's of others. Digusting liar. / []
You don't tell someone that you haven't been in contact with for 6 years you don't want to have contact with them anymore.  No reasonable person would believe that.  You sweat a lot when you do cocaine. / []
He's like traving paper, you can  clearly see he is lying / []
های از لندن  خانم مسنی هستم که الانه ترا یک کرمی می بینم که تو لجن داره مل غلطه  برو خودتو ملت کن که اثری ازت نباشه  خودت دو تا دختر داری ، سرا هم لنگه تو هست ، / ['می غلطه *', 'های از لندن نه نه جوجه ها فریادشان در آمده دادمیزنند که ترا نمی شناسند وتواز جوجه ها نیستی \nیک حیوان دیگر را انتخاب کن لطفا ،', 'های از لندن \nاین ناز نازی را اذیت نکنید  \nاین می\u200cرفته اونجا بخوابه چون پول هتل نداشته وبین حرفاش سک سکه \nمی افته  ،']
He says he’s wracked his brain to try to recall these things..not that he just absolutely would never have even thought of doing them! / []
So....mummy paid 12 million pounds to a woman that I had never met to keep her quiet????. As of now...its all came out ...this interview was total lies. / []
So let's get this straight. He remembered distinctly being at pizza express ....next words .. when someone reminded me ...I thought oh yes. What a fkn liar. Vile. / []
মনজুর রহমান❤❤❤ / []
He can't stand a grown woman! Despicable!😡 / []
Who’s here after the release of Virginia Giuffre-Robert’s book 📕release? —————————-> / []
He is obviously not telling the truth / []
Freudian Slip “ what I was doing” then corrects “ what he was doing”  👀 / []
Teddybears😮😮😮😮😮 / []
bet he sweat during this interview / []
Lier😮😮😮😮 / []
poor man.....his memory is soooo bad / []
Wow... That man has a very, very dark aura 😳😳 / []
Not relevant to the subject matter, but it’s a weird feeling that this was only a couple of months before the world was turned upside down by Covid … / ['Yes, I think about that too. It is an echo from another world.', '@Rebecca-oh5yhwell said']
It’s painfullly ironic of course that Emily will never get an OBE for this, though she is probably the one person who deserves it the most in history / []
Why did he agree to this interview again? / []
How many people have ever said ‘just a straight forward shooting weekend’?. / []
He obviously is not a good liar. / []
If there is a life after death and if karma exists, some people may be in a very big trouble / []
We were friends because of other people’= you mean minor girls being trafficked. Got it. / []
What a disgrace. / []
The lady doing the interview was very calm / []
What a disgusting pig / []
The sheer amount of adrenaline that must have been pumping around Ms Maitlis' body, when she realised this was history in the making, must have been almost too much to bear / ['She did a magnificent job… The actors that call themselves journalist in the US could learn a lesson from her!']
It is hard for me to like this video, but the interview was brilliant. / []
I-I-I-I-I...... 😂 says someone who is guilty AF! / []
Island of strangers - the strangers being the royals. / []
I think that photograph was taken on that island / []
Paedophile !!!! / []
Wow this guy can sure lie! 😂it’s unreal and what’s funny is he thinks people can’t see thru to him!! Lmao 🤣 / []
In a court of law, you would be found guilty ! / ['Of what?']
Why are the under age girls there ! what about the parents ? they should be looking after there Daughter's, ! / ['Those were kids coming from very very very broken families .']
He is probably still abusing young girls but now he needs Viagra to get it up ! Another Jimmy Savile ! / []
Nazi BBC = Churchill Liar Shakespeare Liar / []
how was he even allowed to do the interview is beyond understanding, absolute car crash / []
This guy had 40 escorts showing up at his hotel on his official four-day trip to Thailand (yes, that's ten women a day!). Epstein said that Andrew was more perverse and more "obsessed with p%ssy" than Epstein himself. And we are to believe that he never, EVER had anything to do with Epstein's sex trafficking. He really thinks we are all idiots. / []
10:01 with the knowledge of today: what a liar... 🤢🤮 / []
Buffoon  !!!! / []
This is literally one of the funniest interviews ever and almost to the point where it could of been used as a skit in a comedy show / []
A face that needs punching (Andrew) / []
His defence of the famous photo with Virginia is laughable.  “We can’t be certain that’s my hand on her left side” Google the photo..you can literally see his arm in the gap between them. 🤦‍♂️ / []
"its very hard to forget a positive act like sex and I don't remember anything so therefore it didn't happen". There is this other thing that people do too Andrew, its called "lying". / []
If he does this in court he's done 😂😂😂 / []
His sweating excuse 😂 Would have been more believable had he said the dog ate his homework! / []
Worth $25mill and he needed "a place to stay"....😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 / []
The funny thing is he keeps saying he wasn’t really friends with Epstein but rather with his girlfriend.   The girlfriend is also a convicted sex offender! / []
The prince looks fearfully nervous / []
Excellent investigative journalism / []
Massive FREUDIAN slip at 10:20 / []
He wasn’t really a friend. But I felt I had to go all the way to NY to tell him we can’t have anymore contact.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Knowing what we know now, this is just sickening to watch. He believes his own lies. / []
From the Encyclopædia Britannica (Propædia), 2026 edition:     :-J Masterclass Interview, see: Maitlis, Emily (2019) / []
Would love to see him re interviewed / []
I think this is the most impressive performance by an interviewer I’ve ever seen. / []
I may be gullible but I believe Andrew / ['Then delete “may” and replace with “am”', 'Why not the only evidence to the  contrary is the testimony of a women now dead who effectively sold herself for Cash and 12 million reasons  to lie  that he was one of the men she slept with']
It’s not a “public display of affection” in that photograph. / []
That line: "it was a convenient  place to stay"👀🤦🏽‍♀️ A complete arse hole of the first order! he literally took the air out of the room when he uttered those words.  ...Hmm 🤔 is there CCTV evidence of him arriving/ dropping off his daughters at the pizza 🍕 restaurant in Woking? ...🤔 / []
Incredible,  history will judge / []
“I had to show leadership” That’s entitled delusion of royal proportions right there / ['... delusions of granduer, self importance, entitlement & clearly thinks he\'s done nothing wrong.\n\nHe was advised not to do this interview, however, i\'m so glad he did as we can \nALL S👀 & hear his lies.\n\nThe line: "it was a convenient place to stay" 🤔🤦🏽\u200d♀️ & Maitlis genuine reaction in the moment, priceless!', '@dionnegonsalves8188unforgettable!']
Why would you stay with anyone? No way. No wonder this interview was a train wreck. He should be angry and fiery, but he’s condescending and awkward. / []
Dude needs to be in a room with a bottle of whisky and a revolver and be told to do the honorable thing / []
"My tendency to be too honorable"   staying at the home of a known sex offender.   Not sure how that would make sense - on any planet. / []
Dont worry adrew,three quarters of the people judging you are going to hell themselves for being liars,for being adulterous, for being whoremongers, for being homosexuals, for being arrogant or prideful in his/ her own eyes,for witchcraft,for murder,for being extortioners,greedy,for envy,strife or jealousy! He whos wothout sin,cast the first stone humanity  but they're going to people that still do because they're arrogant and prideful in their own eyes. / []
Democracy . /noun/    A socialist system of governance, in which the State steals from the smart, capable and innovative, and gives to hoards of low IQ, black and brown scum, thieves, rapists and murderers. From men to women. From straight people, to homosexual demons. In a democracy,  presidents and prime ministers are pre-selected, but the a clown-show called "elections" usually creates the pretense of "competition".  Democratic leaders are almost always pedophiles and rapists.   Example 1:  - Did you vote in the latest election?  - Yes! I am excited for our new president to rape children   Example 2:  - Do you like our system of constitutional monarchy and representative democracy?  - Of course! I love pedophilia, and supporting our existing system is the best way of empowering pedophiles / []
You can actually see his nose growing / []
Certified, Prince Andrew is really the Queen‘s most beloved child and she definitely loved him so much perhaps loved him way toooooo  much !!!! / []
No remorse at all for his actions which means he didn’t care or think twice of the abuse / []
LOLITA EXPRESS WAS THE NAME OF THE PLANE & IT WAS A FLYING BROTHEL ... .HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS NO SIGN...HE IS AN EXPERT ON CHILD SEX ABUSE AND KNEW THE SIGNS...THERE WAS NONE.... CAN SOMEONE GET ME A DRINK PLEASE ! SPEED IT UP ! / []
Compulsive lair enough said dig a hole Andrew 😅😅😅😅 / []
GUILTY AS HELL....LITERALLY ! SHE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF HIM.....LITERALLY... ANDREW IS ONE HELL OF A MAN.....LITRALLY... WHAT IS IN ANDREWS FUTURE?......WHERE WILL HE GO?........ YOU GET ONE GUESS ~ / []
Let us not forget... This interview was HIS idea.! / []
Taxpayer funder freeloading Jimmy Saville. / []
Everything he says on this interview is a slap in the face of British secret service. All those movies about James Bond and here sits a guy in a chair, who was using his dick to think instead of his brain. Any decent person that hears just a rumour about one of his mates being a sex offender thinks twice and avoids being remotely associated with. Certainly doesn't organise shootings, parties and holidays together. And that's without this guy's infinite resources, police, intelligence and the circle of high profile people around him. Somehow I'm not surprised Jimmy Savile's crimes were possible for so many years, if even at the top things like Epstein's island were possible... / []
He hung himself! / []
The Grand old Duke of York He gave 12 million quid To someone he said he never met For something he never did. / []
He kept saying Ghislaine was his friend and Jeffrey was her +1.  Then after Epstein was convicted of being a pedophile, he felt the honorable thing to do was to go and stay several days with Epstein and have a face to face conversation with a man he acts like he barely knew. Andrew and Sarah are both liars and need to  do the honorable thing and go away. / []
The ultimate comedy sketch!. / []
Man. This is so much worse now than it was at the time. / []
Well, I for one am completely convinced by his account. / []
40:35 Maitlis: „Epstein is dead“ Andrew: (chuckles) „Yes! 😅“  His reaction was weird, he seemed happy and relieved about the fact his friend died. / []
‘I have no recollection of meeting this young girl, but I know for a fact that day I was under the sheets with her, I told Fergie my alibi.. which was I had a hot dog in Pizza Express’ 😂 / []
Comments are lovely 😅 / []
Andrew forever making poor decisions / []
This video will be used for many years to come by PR and marketing students on how to successfully have your client exposed for being a liar. / []
#princeadrewthepedo / []
Holy s***, is this guy ever a big liar man?I wish there was just stop throwing these people in jail.Because if that was anybody else they'd be in jail for liperverts is a pedophile far I exactly what this guy is / []
He is guilty as hell and should be investigated by the police as any ordinary person should be / []
Dream  andrew    you are one  of  them....             🎉 / []
UH UH  PRINCE   YOU  DID  !   You are predator .. / []
Can the staff who were working at Pizza Express that evening tell everyone in the world that you saw a Prince and Princess that time on your shift. Please report this. It's vital information. / []
"I don't know Tramps" "I know I never bought a drink in Tramps when I was there." / ['I caught that too!']
He thinks he nailed it 😬 / []
Epstein was constantly having to give Fergie money, reportedly more than a million, and Jeffrey was sick of her / []
Liar Liar pants on fire / Oct 2025 - / []
Epstein had a massage with a "happy ending" 3 times a day...tyere was a lot of nudity and young girls hanging around / []
Disgusting pig / []
At the beginning of the interview, he said Epstein wasn't his friend and that he was a "one plus." He then admits friendship and loyalty to Epstein later on in it. / []
The FOX            is having  the Last😮 / []

What a masterpiece! It should be taught in every journalism programme to show students how it's done -  subtle, gentle, almost compassionate — allowing the respondent an astonishingly unbecoming self-destruction! Just brilliant! Journalism at its best! / []

What a prick 😂 / []
Fascinating to watch this in 2025. At 9 minutes he explains staying w Epstein FOR DAYS on NY after Epstein's conviction. The purpose of the extended visit was to break-up w him IN PERSON.  And didn't he pay this young woman he never met or had sex with? This man is a narcissistic idiotic who thinks he is brilliant for doing this interview. As he frequently  prefaced his comments "you have to understand" he is GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY. / []
Strange how twice he half laughs about Epstein being brown bread. As for the rest, look how he lies his way through this whole interview. The mouth opens and the lies just roll out. / []
What a great interview’ Andrew is plain stupid and guilty  . Entitled sick idiot / []
I wasn't able to watch this the first time around so I want to express my sincere gratitude for finding it today. He must be the most stupid person in the world to think that this would help him. He met with Epstein to tell him they couldn't meet so he met with him. / []

In the interview, when asked about his friendship with Epstein and why he invited him to events like shooting weekends, Prince Andrew repeatedly tried to minimise the relationship. He stated that the invitation was for Ghislaine Maxwell and that Epstein was merely her "plus one." He also said it would be a "considerable stretch" to call Epstein a "very, very close friend" and implied his primary relationship was with Maxwell. Given this, why would he meet up with him in Central Park and then stay at his property for four days? If, as he claimed, it was a 'considerable stretch' to call them close friends, why didn't he just phone Epstein to sever ties after his conviction, rather than flying to New York to do it in person? / []

I have to admire the British public. Proudly calling out a fool who is lying miserably.

This is without question the most entertaining video ever released on YouTube. / []
Watch his eyes. He keeps looking down at her breast. The interviewer. / ['😂']
why did he pay her such a large sum of money if he was innocent / ['Because he was too honourable...?', 'Because it would be unbecoming not to']
Liar / []
i dont get it .. was he playing dumb on purpose ? bc my conspircy theory is that he was told he was charming his whole life just to find out he's a moron on national tv / []
what has been this guys contribution to anything ? he has disgraced the royal family 's name.     this is the result of being entitled and living off the british taxpayers his whole life.  it appears epstien was his pimp for young girls. / []
16:45 this was the moment. This is the absolute lowest (or highest depending on your perspective) point of the interview. / []
22:08 😮 he is just ridiculous and came across as a liar / ['"There\'s a medical condition that says I didn\'t do it, so therefore..." 🤣']
he should've never given this interview.  it would've been better for him to stay quiet even if people wanted him to speak. / []
He is not an honorable man,  fullstop / ["I would say he's very unbecoming"]
Disgrace... A lier and abuser : he place is in prison  ... / []
Dirty, lying vile BA$TARD! He should be in prison!! / []
What a Knob / []
Why does he chuckle when she said "Esptein is dead " and he goes "yeeees" 40:35 / ['Nervous laugh but I\'d say it indicates relief \n\nAs in he\'s chuckling out of "thank goodness he is or he would out me" \n\nThat\'s my theory', '\u200b@lattelucks4924or he knows who killed him, trump told him']
I’m here after finishing listening to Virginia’s book. There are a lot of red flags in this interview and then you listen to the book and some his remarks don’t add up. This guy is not telling the truth. / []

Makes you sick , all these lies , no we know he's straight to Epstein by e'mail to tell him were in this together ...and there so much more for us to know ..fkn lying prick.'.convenient place to stay" are you fkn serious ' get a fkn hotel before sharing the royal family name with a fkn pederist , (No there lots more were getting to know now Andrew ' your fkd )  jail is where this prick  belongs.. 😂🤦 he didnt sweat 😂 is this cnt for real 😂  'no way back from this matey"😂.. / []

Did Virginia really commit suicide? / ['Did Epstein!', 'Probably not, she was bumped off but had to be paid $12M so no-one would believe she was murdered']
The entire interview is just absurd. When you have to tell the interviewer that you don’t sweat and you’re only just now able to sweat again, it very much sounds like a lie. / []
King Andrew. We should worship him every day, pay him billions, sign over all daughters to him, give him all of London, give him a Range Rover fleet, give him 250 private planes, lock Fergie away, feed him caviar and wagyu steak or sausages with mashed potato and peas, appoint Ghislane Miniwell as his secretary, get him to open any and every kindergarten whenever he wants, give him free dental service, give him an automatic bum washer/wiper, never charge him rent, declare him a Saint- the patron Saint of Narcissism, provide him with a lifetime supply of Viagra and give him the power to edit everything.

Andrew......what a bloated parasite,worthless ,lying douche bag😂 / []
How would the Queen respond to this interview / ['How did! She was still alive!']

The poor QUEEN😢 / []
In the netflix documentary the man who did all the security and electrical on Epstein's island said he saw Prince Andrew and a young blonde topless girl grinding and kissing next to the pool . He said he was later show a picture of the girl and identified her . Why would he make that up , this guy is clearly lying and doesnt know what else to say. / []
I can never get enough of this interview. If have to consider this the most hilariously cringe and entertaining interview I've ever watched in my life. It couldn't have been written any better. / []

Such a snake trying to wriggle out of the situation. We need a follow up interview. / []
Life’s tough when you’re too honourable. Poor little victim Andrew. Lol / []
”My judgement was probably colored by my tendency to be to honorable” 😳 GIVE ME A BREAK!! / []
"There was no indication of underage sex trafficking. And, if there was . . ." Meaning there was. Why hasn't Andrew Windsor been charged? / []
You can tell when he is lying. His lips move / []
Why is his necktie crooked? Where are his people? Who let him go on camera with his tie askew like this? 😂 This interviewer is top notch. She is has a very soft voice, but her jacket is rather paramilitary looking. She is blonde & rather small, but she is mighty! She made mincemeat out of this ridiculous idiot. It’s “Tramp”, not “Tramps”, Andrew. / []
I hope people don't think he is a liar / ['😂😂']
This clown deserves his worldwide humiliation / []
The photo was upstairs “I’ve never been upstairs “ ☠️What a clown / []
Wooow arogant 🤡💩💩💩 / []
I have to say...he doesn't seem very bright. / []

It's crazy to watch this again after all the information that has come out. Right from the beginning of the interview everything he says is absolutely fake, a lie, pure bs. / []
Don't stand on the platform Andrew, you have stood Infront of the train / []
'you threw her a birthday party' 'No, it was a straightforward shooting weekend '  'You went to a party as a guest of honour' 'No, I went to a dinner party at his house'  The absolute brass neck of these royals. Rotten to the core. / ['He can’t admit he attended any party, because a party in those circles involves abusing young women.']
Andrew is an honourable man after this interview I have new found respect for him and all doubts have Been cleared he his innocent as they come / []
"Is it that you know these things didn't happen, or that you simply can't recall that they happened?" "Yes" "You say the photo is odd because it must have been taken on the second floor of Maxwell's house, yet you also claim to not have been on the second floor of her house before.  How did you know where the photo was taken if you hadn't been there before." "Because if I had been there before, I don't recall it" "And as per the claim of the literary agent who claims to have seen you get the foot massage?" "That's someone I don't know describing an event I don't recall with a person I've never met before, to the best of my recollection.  So I think that's part of the confusion." "But it did happen during the dates you said you were at Epstein's house" "Yes but there were so may people there, many of whom I don't recall.  I was there, but only so I could say that I'd never be there again; which, if you're a gentleman, takes a matter of a few days and dinners to accomplish politely.  I told him in the park that we should never see each other again, at which point I returned to his house to, you know, really let the point stick in" "Any regrets?" "Look, it's not about what never happened and what can't be recalled, it's about the friends we make along the way" / []
She should have just asked a toddler with chocolate around their mouth if they stole the cookies 😂 not making fun of the poor victims just saying he is as believable as a space monkey who plays piano .god gless tje world every single one of us . / []
Why not blame the pimp or the prostitute? Why blame the customer? Just like drug dealers / []
For a man, it requires positive action. So for a woman, it just requires being in the room. Huh. / []
Come and stay and use my places, he over talks his answers, trying to justify his lying / []
10:16 interesting Freudian slip / []
"I went to stay with him because I wanted to tell him it would be inappropriate for us to be seen together."   At least half of the preds Chris Hansen confronts are more credible. / []

Best interviewer and most insane interview ever. This arrogant and ignorant person, thinks he can show up, and spread his royal dust, so people can see what a  big persona he is. / []
" If the original is ever produced " therfore he probably knows that the original is gone, lost for ever or destroyed, can never be produced, he has probably already been phoning round to make sure the original is gone. / []

Epstien said of Andrew in one of the newly released emails,   " That Andrew had perversions  way beyond mine" / []
Charles is no more intelligent than Andrew & yet these are the people telling you how to live your lives. / []
He had the extraordinary ability to bring people togeather.... By offering up young girls on tap, then filming it all and using it as leverage. / []
He is what people would have called "A Wrongun" / []
The Royals, the neighbours nobody would want. / []
I am to honourable a person to not spend four days away with my paedophile friend ha ha / []
22:00 Drugs are funny like that. / []
The REALLY DIFFICULT part to believe is that he travelled to New York, and stayed with Epstein in his home, KNOWING that he is a CONVICTED CHILD SEX OFFENDER!  Why????? Oh just to let him know that they could no longer continue with their friendship and end it. Andrew, you could have just stayed at home and called the monster! / []
This is how a member of the Royal family is interviewed for rape, sex trafficking and paedophilia. Not quite the same as 24 hours in Police Custody is it? / []
And look at Epstiens girlfriend she was part of it and jailed for it !!!! / []
Liar simple / []
Grotesque little man.  From his beady little eyes down. Stupid man too.  Dumb as a sack of bricks. / []
He lied through this entire interview. What a terrible person that wants to take no accountability for his actions / []
He is B.S- ing!💩💩💩💩💩 / []

There’s someone in America that’s been trafficked for 45 years… tell him to answer that / []

He needed a drink after that 🍷🍸🍹🍺🍻🥂🥃 / []
Emily Maitlis is a superb interviewer. She isn't remotely holding back because it's a 'Royal' interviewee, and is straight  and to the point.  Well done Ms Maitlis. 👍 / []
12:06  "It was a convenient place to stay."  -  I imagine a crackhead would find a crackhouse to be a convenient place to stay as well. / ["And a sex addict finding himself at a procurer's house who is known to supply illegal underaged vulnerable girls."]
and the lies just rolled off  his tongue...  time to stop this worship of the Royal family! / []
Tell me one of your biggest weakness. „I am too honorable“ / []
Would love to hear an interview now he's been banished to Scotland , hopefully he would spill the royals secrets to get them back 😂 / []
I’ve come back to this interview after Virginia's posthumous memoir was published and all the fallout from it. Just before her book came out I read Entitled by Andrew Lownie and I’ve really got to commend Michael Sheen's performance in A Very Royal Scandal — he gives this man depths he does not deserve. / ["My library doesn't have her book yet."]
This guy is sure stuttering a lot! 😂 / []
"I wondered...Why did I go???" You know exactly why you went! / []
BS / []
Abolish the monarchy and nationalize all royal lands and properties for the public benefit / []
Nearly 6 years later, and Emily Maitlis' interviewing technique is still quietly and respectfully ruining this nonce's life. 👏 / []
He tells a story, similarly to the pedophile in the White House today. / []
You'd be tempted to call him a : C-aring  U-nderstanding  N-ice  T-ype....but he lacks Depth and Warmth... / []
He had sex with children - WHY IS HE NOT IN PRISON ? / []
She should have asked him if he would take a lie detector test. / ['daammnn that wouldve been so good']
This will never get old. 😂😂 / []
Creep!!! Pervert!!!! And thief!!!! / []
Tell me you are a liar without telling me you are a Liar! / []
24.30 he says hes never been upstairs in the house where photo was taken. He says it was upstairs. How does he know that then / []
10:20 oops 😬 / ["damn that's a really good catch"]
Andrew, you insult people's intelligence.    🇬🇧 / []
"I don't sweat...um, or actually ...yes I didn't sweat at the time....".     !? What "time" is that then, the "time" you claim to have no recollection of, the "time" at which you say you weren't present....(?!) The colossal Cretin.... / []
31:50 "If you're a man you have to take positive action". WTF!? So is he admitting to his out of control promiscuity? But he didn't with Guiffre? It gets weirder and weirder. He contradicts himself but the interviewer didn't pick up on it. He also says he was not in the top floor of the house but was in the ground floor but doesn't remember the photo taken. So many holes in his story. / []
He lies about the previous lie. He couldn’t tell the truth if it smacked him in the eye. Horrible, unpleasant self important fool. Intelligence isn’t his strong point. Dishonest like his wife, both having to find outside means of money, for their lavish lifestyle. Parliament should be taking action to get rid of this man from The Royal Family, he is a liability. / []
15:30..."you can look at it in so many different ways and the fact of the 'fatter' is...". / []
Prince Andrew: yes, she had sex with me, but i had no sex with her  🤣😂😂😂😂or I was drunk and have no memory at all / []
‘Party prince? I never have really partied. I was single for quite a long time.’ Oh yes because no one parties when they’re single 😂 / []
A particularly low IQ !!! like, very low, .. without even limited composure to conceal body language, so EQ is also very under developed. Over protected & indulged child. ... very evident in this. / []
The most cringe worthy interview in all of human history coming from an aristocratic, entitled, royal member. / []
Crooked tie for a crooked guy / []
You don’t need to remember the photo you just need to Look at it moron it’s you in a real photo ! / []
I know we made a lot of this at the time but upon reflection I really don’t think we made enough of a deal about it. Is he for real / []
This clown should have been a coal miner 😂 / []
Going to pizza hut was a very unusual thing for the duke of dork to do😂😂😂😂😂😂😂... He had no recollection. If it had anchovies on it or not😂😂😂😂 / []
Here listening to this for the first time after watching the interview of Paul Page, an ex-security at Buckingham Palace on 60 minutes Australia.   I think if anyone with any shred of intelligence listened to this abuser stutter and mumble, without any of the damning evidence we all know today, it would still be undeniably obvious that this person is a shameless, cowardly liar.   My God, what a dumbass. And to think so many women got fooled into their sex trafficking ring just because of his royal title is heartbreaking. / []
This man makes me sick to my stomach. How stupid does he think we are? / ['Very', 'Even more stupid than he is']
If he was so innocent then why after all this time has he agreed to drop his titles?  The Royal family must have concrete information on him to force him to drop them. We will probably never know the extent of his wrong doings unless Ms G Maxwell writes her life story. Wonder if she will throw him under the bus when she is released. Interesting, depends if she is hard up on release !!!! / []
Fake person 😂😂😂😂 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 cosmopolitan group😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
So he or the tax payer, gave Virginia millions to settle a lie.  The interviewer is very weak.  Guilt oozes from this brat of an ahole.  What a horrible man and family he comes from.  What kind of parents produce men that kill off women who call them out.  Weak extremely weak people.  These are the people English look up too and try to be like.  What a fkd country and people.  Gross.  Colonial terrorists who think they are gods chosen people.  This is the truth underneath it all.  England you should be utterly ashamed of yourselves and what you've done to people worldwide.  Here is one of your leaders 😮 this is you. / []
"Do you regret the relationship with Epstein?"  "No, look at all the young girls I got my grubby hands on" / []
It is wild that there is still absolutely no acknowledgement of Laura Burns journalism  regarding Andrew... / []
I’m not a  “confrontationalist ”… WOW!  You Sir, are an absolute liar! I’ve seen the dreadful manner in which you’ve treated your personal protection officers overseas first hand … you Sir, are a disgrace. / []
Only have to look at his eyes to tell he's a liar. Real eyes realise real lies. / []
Andrew you are a liar and an embarrassment  to the royal family and the people of this country you should be told to leave this country and banned from returning like your weasel of a nephew Harry the prat / []
This idiotic twit can't lie 🤥 his nose is getting bigger by the Question. 😮 / []
Entitled idiot… / []
Fkin clown Prince full of bullshit / []
Rabbit in headlights, im cringing listening to this. Very calculated answers. / []
I wonder which minion polishes his shoes for him. / []
Not a close friend but feel free to use my houses, my island and my jet anytime you want 😂😂😂 / []
How did that reporter sit there with a straight face. This should be used as a training tool for how to spot body language when someone is lying through their teeth. He learnt how to sweat that day. He was sweating like a rapist hiding in a cupboard!! / []
I heard his pink colored palace had photos of naked women plastered all over the inside of it.. / []
Did he just pull the mental health card? 46:00 / ['I certainly would, its worth a try, if that dont work Pull Im insane card..😊. ALL that Partying has to do some damage…']
10:53 not because your a convicted sex offender and that’s abhorrent, but because it looks bad for me to be seen with you now 👍🏻 / []
The 'honorable and right thing to do" was to stay at a sex offenders house.    'My  judgement was coloured by my tendancy to be too honourable'...   🙈 / []
Formerly known has Prince / []
He is no royalty by morality, just  an entitled arrogant predator, no less, no more. The world need to see him for who he truly is. / ['Youd be surprised how un morally royals are']
Prince Andrew, you are GUILTY! / []
Whoah, this is the most cring-worthy trainwreck Ive ever seen. They should use this in every law school and psych class in the world as an example of everything that could possibly go wrong. What a moron. I wouldve loved to have heard the phone call from the Queen as soon as he walked off set... / ['Ikr, I had to stop the video multiple times because of second hand embarrassment.']

Unbelievable,the absolute denial of what he has done. / []
How to avoid answering the question 🤣 just put him on a lie detector and be done with it, he’s going to jail / []
It’s wild that he has never faced a real investigation or charges. / ['Andrew let da fookin team down 😂', 'He will now.', 'Has any Royal?', "Becose the Queen don't let , now I am to take upset with Queen... She was almost perfect like Queen but with your Son's  .... definitely didn't good work  .", 'And likely never will.']
Never had any contact from the walk in the park to emailing "we're in this together...play again soon".... / []
He is a terrible liar. And he's just plain terrible! / []
His facial expressions 😂😂😂 / []
Gosh, he is such a terrible liar. What a scum bag. / []
Flew to house for 4 day party so i could tell him we couldn't be freinds anymore 😂 / []
He is a spoiled little boy .he has had everything given to him . the only thing he cares about is his teddy bear 🧸 grow up get a real job . / []
Is Andrew paid by the public purse to abuse children for hisj sexual needs. He should be jailed regardless of  his royalty. / []
Did he ever have sex with Donald Trump? / ['He has no recollection of that.']
This man is lying out of his teeth. It's written all over his face. / []
18:09 Jeffrey being in & out was an understatement. / []
This is a classic example of the Kruger-Dunning effect, when stupid people think they're smart. He actually thnks he's the smartest person in the room. / ["That's actually not what the Dunning Kruger effect is. The Dunning-Kruger effect is about people who are not good at a specific task, rating themselves as better than they are. They do not even rate themselves as highly as the people who are good at it rate themselves, just simply higher than accurate. And has nothing to do with intelligence at all."]
Poor dude, it his friendship with Gislyne that dragged him in the mud. She came from a bad background, he seems a naive dude that raised inside of protective palace, the world outside is unforgivable Why the Palace didnt get a check in him in order to make the Prince know where he was into. There many business organization in the world, Epstein traped him in his web of evil. Glad Gislyne in jail. / ['He is an adult. He needs to take personal responsibility.']
Maybe he stayed because Epstein had teddy bears on his bed? Look  up the interview a here his workers make andrews bed and if they dont put the teddy bears where he wants them he goes nuts. They say he was the queens favorite. / []
49 minutes of lies. He's said he was working for a charity for abused children that's makes it worse. I believe he should be in court and jail If found guilty. Your mom doesn't pay 11 million if your innocent. This man turns my stomach. Having sex with under age girls. If it was a ordinary person they be in jail by now. Not in a 30 room mansion / []
I love how he openly implicated all forms of the system, who were involved with this debacle. Andrew being truly the tip of the iceberg, what a parasite. / []

So how can you tell the photograph was taken upstairs? / ['Bingo 👀', "I've thought exactly the same", "It's simple logic.

I got in contact with a convicted sex offender, to say that I can’t be in contact with a convicted sex offender, whilst celebrating my friend the sex offender getting off being a sex offender, whilst staying at the same house of a convicted sex offender…..got ya prince….feel like there’s a register you need to be on.

This interviewer is EXPERT. A masterclass in thorough research, pointed questions, emphasized re-approach of questions... This interviewer was not there to make Former Prince Andrew comfortable… / ['She would make a good police interview', 'Masterful.', 'And the producers who helped behind the scenes.', 'Dispassionate. Showing no emotion. Not salacious. Masterfully done!', 'She stole the credit for this interview from another hard working woman who did all the groundwork']
I like how you kept it concise. / []
I love how his private secretary stood behind camera, could see he was burying himself and didn’t intervene or try to stop the interview 😂.. they all disliked him and knew how this interview would play out 👏🏻👏🏻 / []
I racked my brains to see if I could remember sex. He says / []
He keeps saying that they were not that close, but he still felt the need to fly to the USA to meet Jeffrey in person, so he could break off the friendship. Seems like a lot of effort for someone he is not that close to. / ["Andrew couldn't resist those masks and chains 😂"]
We weren't good friends  but he let me stay at his houses for free😂😂. It's funny, he is slimy, dirty rat. Randy Andy living up to his name, he's lying  blind Freddy can hear it. You can't FAKE a flash in the background. His house was full of nude photos of women and he admitted a train station full of girls going in and out. He laughed when she said Epstein is dead, have anything to do with that Andy?? / []

What a mouthful of bull!!! He is stuttering like he’s guilty. His answers are not believable at all !!!! / []
I think we can safely say Andrew has also conducted himself in a manner unbecoming. / []
I think he must not be too bright if he really agreed to do this interview... / []
He'll neck himself soon / []
hahahaha such Bullshit. It's so obvious. / []
What a sick man, he is disgusting person,the queen must of been so hurt / []

RIP VIRGINIA 🕊️ may you find peace and these people that hurt you suffer in the end from their lies. He doesn’t recall meeting Virginia. The explaining he keeps talking so much trying to reassure everyone it was not him. Why would she be saying these things, watch his face carefully. When you get old I hope you realise and remember the pain you caused .. His rambling and explaining it with so much detail to make out he is not guilty. He makes me sick with the worst body language.  In the end you will pay for your actions. / []
An evil man. The worst. His false modesty is as sickening as it is blatant. / []
The media do a great job of taking someone out. Who's next? / []
Randy Andrew . he is fond of young flesh. / []
The way he blinks rapidly when lying is a dead giveaway… / []
Bare faced liar. / []

He sounds like my husband.  I show him the evidence on his infidelities and his answer is : I don’t know her, I don’t remember at all, I have no recollections of this.

Anyone here watching this before reading Virginia Giuffre’s book / []
He doesn't remember what epstein said because he's too self-involved. I'm very disappointed in the queen for hiding his vile behavior / []
Sometimes I come back to this just to watch this putz fumble his way through this / []
So she had to Quit because she is been told to so , after this interview. Interested. / []
I’m leaning towards Prince Andrew having something to do with the death of Epstein. 16:41 / []
Watching it again in October 2025 and can now really see how sick this ‘man’ is, actually VILE..!!💯 / []
Emily did an amazing job. Well.done. / []
Hammered the nails in his own coffin and poured his own dirt on it. / []
@ 13.43 why is he so astonished when Emily Matlis mentions the author John Brockman ? . He’s lying through his teeth, got away with this type of behaviour all his life . GUILTY as can be / []
Oct 2025, with the release of both Giuffre's and Lownie's books, I bet Prince Andy is sweating now!! / []
Author Andrew Lownie's recent interviews demonstrate that Andy must have known what was going on at Epstein's home - penis-shaped bars of soap in the bathroom, pictures of naked young girls on the walls, young girls swimming naked in the pool etc. And yet, in this interview, Andy states that while serving as Patron of the NSPCC (organisation against child abuse) that he "... knew what the things were to look for, but I never saw them"!! Lownie in his book "Entitled" has demonstrated Andy to be lying time and time again. / []
2007 was it...... / []
His whole focus on why he couldn’t be friends with Epstein after his conviction was because he felt it would be incompatible for them to be friends. He never said, because he was appalled or upset that Epstein had harmed all those girls. Never once said that. / []
How much BS are we willing to allow these scoundrels to throw on us ? / []
The simple fact that he only ever says he doesn't remember x y z and never actually denies x y z is all you need to know.  He clearly thinks everyone's an idiot. / []
Can  clearly see who's royalty and who's idiot / []
I watched this vid minimum ten times...cause its so  entertaining....😂😂😂😂😂 / []

Everyone needs to watch this professional analysis by Dr. G:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g62irDKDkPc Prince Andrew is a blatant, fumbling liar! / []
“In and out all over the place” pretty much sums up Andrew and Epstein. / []
And very possibly much worse / []
Andrew is a tosser / []
Liar / []
This is a man of very limited intelligence / []
Lieing prick. / []
Prince Andrew should be closed / []
Hopefully he end up in court. First the King must dispense with him from the Royal Family for good. / []
What a vile man / []
Andrew is doing a lot of stuttering through his sentences.  I've heard him give speeches. He usually does't stutter.  It sounds like he's making it up as he goes along. / []
What a stupid man / []
Nobody would believe Prince Andrew / []
Prince Andrew is talking bullshit. The UK Government should fully investigate this man!! / []
He’s got to move to a smaller council house? / []
His legal team suggesting this interview needed to happen was: Mossad button —————————> 😂 / []
He said it was convenient place to stay with epstein., what a joker / []
New drinking game - drink every time he blinks / []
Seems like a Parky conversation. Wonder how much was on the cutting room floor? And who allowed it to be done in Buckingham Palace? And is the interviewer a turncoat, now crowing at her gotcha? / []
I can’t even finish watching it. It’s so painful. Like a three-year-old lying / ['At least when a three-year-old tells you bald-faced lies it’s kind of cute & funny.']
Funniest part - he can't give lie 😢😂😂😂 / []
He is a fool.  A lying fool! / []
Disgusting fact is he has 2 daughters..how can a father of 2 daughters done such things / []
Guilty / []
If you want to know how to dig your own grave ..here you go 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
When someone mumbles while giving an interview..it's because they are lying 😞 a man of truth would never mumble 😂😂😂 / []
Err umm umm err um mum erm mmmm ... / []
Me a party man? no never! im surprised he isnt a meme / []
Andrew thought he'd aced the interview, because Emily didn't press him hard or show visible signs of being irritated by his answers. What he didn't realize, was her soft approach was merely a crafty ploy. He told the late Queen the interview '''went well''. Imagine his surprise when he saw the morning papers. / ["It's a symptom of his narcissism. People with this incurable personality disorder have an unreliable perception. Other people see one thing but the narcissist views everything in a way that is favourable to themselves regardless of what is happening."]
He must think we came down in the last rain shower, anyone with any modicum of intelligence can tell he’s a pathological liar and he’s guilty as charged!!.. Disband the Royal family and their parasitical ways,the country is low on resources,no more money to any of them, i’d like to see this country be more resourceful with its resources no more illegals as well detain and deport..Plus wealth create , have those that can work working and raise the personal allowance to £20,000.. !!!STOP Hitting the business with high taxes and hurting them !  you don’t make the poor RICH by making the Rich poor do you??? DOH.!! The trouble with this tyrannical government they’ve got no common sense and get rid of that perfidious starmer and milliband ,scrap net ZERO ITS A LOAD OF BS!! Andrew should face court and a custodial sentence for abusing his position and extortion,wasting public money infuriates me what the Queen gave him😢😢i know this isn’t about money but integrity as  The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively.!! / []
what a liar / []
For a man who has been wearing suits and ties every day of his life, how is it that he didn’t straighten his tie? Either his image consultant was asleep or advised him to try to look like ‘a regular bloke’. Very strange. / []
Andy, you are a lying B            D / []
Tramp is a large and popular nightclub, and Andrew is a very well known person. It is difficult to believe that nobody else in the club has said they saw him dancing with a young woman there. / []
Virginia was VERY specific , she described a globdule of sweat dripping from Andy's bollocks , how do you respond to that ?? / []
Is it just me or does this man have a very low IQ? / []
Andy on Epstein 18:10 to 18.12 "he was in and out all over the place" hmmmm / []
Andy didn't mind staying with a convicted sex offender and now he has lost his Dukedom over it and alot more besides / []
Going to Jeffrey's was not about partying! So what about that email ......"Let's play again soon"! / []
he has a lot of word salad like kamala...similar story telling styles lol / []
Why was there a settlement? / ['To avoid a trial']
Andrew will be found Guilty He used the word horrible that’s something he needs to respect . He’s been given opportunities..his thoughts should be Christian ,but now he will face being humbled. Four days to say bye bye and a walk in the garden together nonsense laughable Embarrassing. Sad day for the royals . / []
Peado / []

#PSEUDODEMENTIA  😅😅😅 / []

This the story he told his mummy and she bought it / []
Why do people keep bringing this up?!  The man said he can’t sweat. Case closed. Move on / []
Prince rapest,,funny how high and money, get away with rape,scum bag... / []
Access to the best legal advice, education, publicists, and education in the country. And hes just a total burk / []
The interview was done so well. He dug his own grave. And mummy can't help him anymore. He was a stuttering all over the place. He can't even wear his tie straight!!! / []
I dont know whos the worse liar. Prince Andrew or Alex Murdaugh. / []
Deport him... / []
Think about this. Prince Andrew is in the line for succession. There is still a chance might be a low chance but still a chance he can be king / ["The late queen Elizabeth used to beg William to not travel with his whole family together because she feared something may happen to them 'aka a crash' she was terrified Harry and his spawn would be entitled to the throne. She knew William and/or his children would be much better suited to take on the role of HRH. Andrew is just an embarrassment."]
He really is just a stuttering, pompous mess🤦🏽‍♀️😂 / []
To testify he would get all the legal advice he could like anybody else. For a probing interview by a professional investigative journalist - what nincompoop advised him? / []
Prince Andrew’s dumb daughter helped facilitate this interview. / ['Which one?']
What a moron. / []
I wish we could have attached a heart rate monitor to him… / []
Why doesn’t he just say flat out that he never had sex with Virginia? / []
What a disgrace. The "royal" family should be ashamed. / []
Can you just imagine what it was like when the interview concluded? He probably left the room as quickly as possible.... / ["Kicked hi s Teddy's around the Bedroom"]
Can we have another interview?? / []
So what if prince andrew slept with alot of people good for him people don't give names so people don't sell stories There is no proof of prince Andrew abusing people physically or sexually He may of been rude But come on 🙄 If prince Andrew was misusing police services the police should of spoke up this guy sounds ridiculous everyone loyalty is to what is right/cosmic law not a royal family or person Just as Americans our loyalty is to the constitution bill of rights It just seems like eveyone is trying to get their 15 minutes of fame / ['He paid 12 million pounds to avoid a trial.', "\u200b@JimmyBoy9878 I understand that however that is his legal right and the alleged victim accepted the money 💰 which is her legal right \n\nbut noone talks about that she accepted cash 💸 so clearly she don't care", '\u200b@jardinejamesand the fact that he was friends with a man after he was facing serious charges involving minors.', '\u200b@JimmyBoy9878 last I heard he disassociated with him when the investigation started', '\u200b@jardinejamesbut he didnt. I dont know how things are in america. But here its common knowledge he was also friends with Saville. So was his brother Charles.']
Bottom line: these are accusations by a person of dubious character who knew perfectly well what she was doing at the time. Only she, Andrew and God know what, if anything, happened. As a high profile individual he will always be a target and while he should know better that doesn’t mean that his judgement will always be perfect. Sad fact about human beings- they are apt to fail. You fail, I fail and Andrew failed. So hate on him but look into the mirror afterwards and see the same sinful flesh. / []
With every lie he told, the hole got deeper. / []
He has taken advantage of his roles for too long / []
If it's all bullshit why did mummy pay out 2 million? The public that still support the Royal Family need their heads examined / []
The uk population don't believe him either. He needs to go! / []
11 million views.... I bet he regrets this interview 😂😂😂 / []
At  the end of the day ! 😂😂😂😂 Billy  Lier! / []
Says 'Um' or 'Erm' after every sentence. This signifies lies as he is thinking hard about not tripping himself up. / ["It shows his arrogance that he would never dare be questioned about his behaviour and clearly he didn't prepare for it because he thought his bullshit would be eaten up like his mother probably did"]
I hate this ad! / []
Emily Maitlis was at her best digging the dirt so deeply. At one point, I thought Andrew felt like running away. / ['He was mumbling like a child 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂', '@RukayaRahman1818 He should be on suicide watch now.']
How proud the queen must’ve been! A real royal jackass! / []
He is the least believable person on Earth. / []
Cringe....seriously.....how uncomfortable... Andrew pants on fire. / []
do you remember her? .ye..'no' / []
This guys is just a bad apple through and through. / []
Me rewatching after now knowing he sended an email to epstein with * hope we will play again soon* / []
Who's watching this again in 2025 after the publication of new emails and Virginia's book? / []
"A convenient place to stay"? Not The Waldorf, The Plaza, The Ritz. The Four Seasons, Fairmont? 😄 🤣 / []
He’s a weasel. Throw him in jail for hurting underage girls!!! / []
cant be arsed to watch all of it, but is there any part in this where he explains why he payed money to the women who accused him???? thanks / ['This was before that happened i belive']
What a complete narcisist it's so obvious / []
So he stayed in the guys house knew nothing saw nothing never photographed knows nothing did nothing was the house on a desert island was he talking to Wilson 😂 / []
'I have dozens of photos of me in that sort of kit (travelling clothes)...' Also: 'As a member of the royal family I take very very few photographs..' / []
If you have no recollection of meeting Virginia, then why did you get your mother to pay her £12 million. / ["If she wasn't doing this for fame and money why did she accept 12 m", '@whitehorses460 if Andrew was innocent, then why did he get his mother to pay the money, rather than go to court. And how was she doing it for fame and fortune? Have some compassion, the woman is dead.', '@clairefrier2353 Yes the Queen is dead, but things have to be said. The Queen was fallible concerning her son and grandson. They let her down badly.', '@ElizabethYallop if you’re referring to Harry, this is nothing to do with him.', '\u2060\u200b\u2060@clairefrier2353It has everything to do with the fact that Andrew and Harry have both have endangered the Monarchy, because the public don’t want to see them using their titles for their own ends, and profiting from them, by doing things likely to embarrass and/or hurt the working royals. It’s quite simple really they both need their titles taking away, I am talking about Prince title also. Andrew and Fergie should have been thrown out years ago. Harry and Andrew have gone over the line, they knew where the line was, and went over it anyway. You can’t have the tail wagging the dog. They will still be rich beyond our measure, they will still have a luxurious life, why should we pay for it.']

Is anyone buying this utter BS?!?!?! He admitted at the start of the interview that Epstein wasn't a good friend but yet he thought it was the right thing to do to fly to America to stop their friendship??????? / []
..."I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable". / []
"...my tendency to be too honorable." This man is a full on sociopath. / ["Nah he's just a spoiled man child who has been overindulged and spoiled by mummy. He clearly thought the public would believe his bullshit"]
Who came here after Nobody's girl / []
I wonder who advised him to give this interview? / []
Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought stupid than to open your mouth and prove it.  He certainly stutters quite a lot.  I don't sweat but I am now. / []
Why would you come on air if you're this bad at lying? / []
This person is a little boy dressed in a big man's suit, in an attempt to play adult. He's so childish. / []
20:19 "I was at home with the children. I had taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express". Which one was it? / ['Pizza Express at Woking. I have been there before.']
Put him to trial like any other member of the public. / []
Karma 👍🏾🫵🏾👑 / []
he needs to be studied as a textbook example of a liar- i have never seen someone lie so much in 50 minutes / []
Trump as guilty. / []
I could play this on a loop forever — it never stops being funny. A truly moronic and shambolic performance by the artist formerly known as the Duke of Porkies. / []
The tie😂 / []
Did he take a  lie detector test ? Should of put him on JKyle / []
"He was in and out all over the place" well that part is certainly true 😂😂 / []
Imagine living your life like this thundering liar...we checked this we checked that,me and my team have checked my lies are not lies and that's not a lie because I don't recall this is a lie and that is not a lie in any way because erm erm erm erm.....🐀 B4****d / []
He didn´t sweat at the time. Bet he´s sweating now! / ["What an original comment............I don't think I've seen it posted a thousand times before.", "Yeah because he's been financially cut off and now can't live off the taxpayers money"]
...what a shady creep... / []
What I was doing / []
Teddy bear loving maniac / []
Normally we would be discussing your work,your duty- 😅😅😅 / []
Who’s watching this after Virginia Giuffre's book was published?? / []
Body language and eyes shows he is lying!  JESUS KNOWS ALL!!!!! / []
This guy needs prison / []
Andrew you're a lier / []
This Interviewer is Brilliant / []
Out of ALLLL the people EVER on the planet, there is" ONLY ONE TRUE ROYALTY" on planet earth!!!  THIS IS MY LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CRIST, THE ONLY ONE I WOULD EVER BOW DOWN TO!!!!  There is no such thing that any PERSON/PERSONS BEING OF "ANY" ROYAL BLOOD ANYWHERE IN HISTORY!!!!  JESUS IS MY LORD!!! / []
This guy needs to go to prison / []
"A foot massage? Never. Because I was shot at in the Falklands, I developed a rare condition which makes my feet fall off when I go to Pizza Express." / ['But only the one in Woking, because going to any of the others would be unbecoming and I have a tendency to be too honourable.']
SCUM!!!!! / []
he had the most extrodinaire ry ability to bring the rich and powerful to abuse , harm , destroy young girls lives.. and   our goverment ..ments ..  our Royal family have done their best to cover this all up..its called a whitewash ..as with the ongoing Rotheram child grooming abuse of young girls scandel..still going on with investigations led by people who can help with the white wash..how many of those abused have resigned from these so called groups of investigations..I did ntgo to celebrate his release ? What a load of bullsh.t....what about the harm done to these young girls..his house ? We saw you cringing behind the door Andrew ..As if you where doing something wrong..I feel sorrow for your daughters.. / []
Another r kelly interview 😂😂😂 / []
Sure buddy 😂 / []
https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?t=1046 - LIAR! / []
he is nasty / []
He wanted to "learn more about the international business world" through Epstein. How about sex trafficking for starters eh Andy. / []
He an the rest of them are so cheap / []
Narcissist, Emily knocked this right out of the park, asked questions that were probing, and just sat back, and let this idiot waffle on and on, in plain sight, this cements what we the tax payer knew all along.  Everything about this guy is wrong, gives me chills this interview, entitled man boy who dug himself so deep in a hole, and he's that ridiculous, he doesn't even know he has.  I sincerely hope the truth will out, and ALL the horrendous, dangerous predators get what is deserved.  Imagine saying, "I had to see him, but stayed in his house and used the excuse, it was easier to do that", sorry, but if this was anyone else, they would sleep on the street, in a bin, anywhere, and then face this cretin, not stay in a house of a convicted beast.  The mind boggles. / []
Truly a scumbag to the core / []
21:10  ''As soon as somebody reminded me of it I went 'oH yEs, I rEmemBeR ThAt!!!' ''.    Up until this point I was extremely sceptical of Andrew's version of events and I was actually coming to the view that he wasn't telling the truth.  But this was the moment when I realised that my misgivings were completely without foundation and that he is, indeed, the upstanding gentleman of valour and honour he claims to be.  TBH, I almost feel as if I owe him an apology for doubting his word. / []
£12 million Andy. Don't give that away just for the sake of it.  😂 man is full of 💩 / []
The stuttering really tells me he is … in fact … an honorable man, being there for honorable reasons, you know?   👀 / []
Media won't stop until it finds a scapegoat to destroy the royal family isn't that correct, Rupert Murdock. / []
Wow. The same number of people have now watched this as lived in Australia in the 1970s. 11 million. / []
this is just comedy gold / []
He had this uncanny ability to bring extraordinary people together. He sure did! / []
Snob sex beast should be in prison 2025 one rule for rich🤢🕵️🤢🕵️🤢🕵️🇬🇧 / []
The poor interviewer is so patient / []
32:50 mins…OMG / []
He's a worse liar than a prince. / []
He’s exactly like David Brent with a posh accent. / ["...except David Brent's a better dancer who doesn't sweat profusely and knows how to find the bar in a nightclub."]
You can tell he’s never been interviewed by the police as a teenager or young adult and lived a privileged and protected life ,, School boy errors from start to finish . Great car crash interview / []
Somebody from tramps must of seen andrew dancing with that girl if so come forward and tell the police / []
You bumbling, stuttering,lying F’ING mess / []
Now go to Australian 60 Minutes and see how he really conducts himself / []
Lie dectecter test should sort it out / []
it's incredible he doesnt even realize how ridiculous he is / []
A pig of a man / ['Insulting to pigs']
i bet he is sweating now!!! / []
Why does Donald Trump absolutely refuse to release any FBI material or evidence about Epstein? / []
Same monster like the Epstein / []
I wonder how he s going to handle living in a jail cell? / []
Low life / []
If only he would simply tell the truth, it would be such a great relief for him — and for everyone else as well. He is, after all, a public figure; that’s the burden he was born with. No one is perfect, but people like him are raised to be perfect, which is impossible — and that’s why they can’t admit their mistakes. / []
OMG that’s so embarrassing! / []
His answer to the very first question shows right away he has no credibility.  And the rest of the interview stayed that way. / []
“I’ve never been… I’ve only been to Woking a couple of times.” / []
Come on bro you got that 17 year old girl just admit it. Not even a crime above 16. Just admit it and move on / []
I have never seen anyone lie so much as he is. Needs a full investigation however I know this won't happen as he is protected being a royal. Utter disgrace of a man. / []
3:36   " I was TRANSITIONING out of the navy" ??   Well, you was done by that surgeon, 'Andrea', you wouldn't pass in a million years .. 'cept as a liar, of course. / []
this is the living, breathing talking epstine files.. just get him to tell everyone who he definitely did not see or hang out with / []
I understand the Epstein files were brutal “ a truly bloody mess from miscarriage of tubal pregnancy dna Epstein baby “   yet when are the accusers going to be held accountable for bringing this up every 2 to 3 to 5 years to stop asking “ the story is never going to change  it is constantly the same with every detail  not explained “   “ the accusers need to take responsibility for bringing this up to the royal family has constantly every 2 to 3 to 5 years  been harassed about this the royal family has nothing to do with Prince Andrew’s late night dateing “ the news media I  feel is constant harassment to the royal family   the prince has said what he knew all along Prince knew about Epstein files  that night the lady suffered a miscarriage a tubal pregnancy meaning the pregnancy fertilized in the tube not the uterus   “ & dna of the deceased embryo showed it was Epstein baby 1 month before the Prince ever got there showing Epstein was a maniac plotting and planning the princes nightmares “  and it takes two to three weeks for a  tubal  pregnancy to show up “    meaning she was already pregnant “ saying she was a virgin to the Prince & was pregnant with Epstein embryo “   Brutal lies “   what about constant harassment to the world to bring this up every 2 to 3 to 5 years    Prince Andrew should make one statement about the beginning of how he met Epstein and the parties that went on and all what the constant people who never let this go “ & have the same information available all the time same file same words same of what happened everytime whomever keeps bringing this up  and hand out flyers everytime the press is there shove them out the door slot with a hop it out of here media now !! & call the guards “   the Prince is constantly harassed about this the Prince admits  what really happened “ took responsibility for his actions although I’m still not sure because it is not  ILEGAL to sex a minor in United Kingdom only in United States when is Uk and USA courts connected ????    IN United States if a male adult sexes a female minor it’s rape even if it’s consensual “ same for a adult woman and minor guy “   When. the people go to   Bother the Prince again have flyers  ready same exact one for every 2-3-5 years ago “   Through the whole statements of news media everyone was about Epstein and Maxwell   then they say the Prince was there in the background every time they never say what the Prince did just that the Prince was there “   Maxwell and Epstein their words   Of maxwell and Epstein constantly rarely is the news media saying the Prince “  the news media yet they constantly bring in the Prince when it has always been Maxwell and Epstein “   Their words Epstein Maxwell Epstein Maxwell Epstein Maxwell then the Prince was in the background  sounds like the Prince is innocent to me and by the laws “ rediculous “    I don’t know how many people know that when a adult in United States even consensual sex to a minor is rape yet in United Kingdom’ it is not against the law to sex a minor why is United States handling Uk court cases how did USA even be involved “ in this case it’s Uk not USA court “ strange “   When are these harassments going to be held accountable for constantly bringing this up this court case is costing billions and the news media making billions on the story what about news media that keeps bringing this up Maxwell and Epstein the Prince in the background   making billions and trillions of dollars out of this story and using the information to like their pockets the story needs to end and be done with it and files shoved out the Royal door same words same thing that happened the same statement in a sworn statement and at the end go away “   Stop using the story to make billions of dollars off of it “ find other ways to help “ make a huge trafficking shelter for women with trafficking can go to shelters “ instead of using to make news media rich “   Concentrate on fixing the trafficking “ use news media money for that “   The news media has made billions of dollars for this story Maxwell and Epstein  and Prince in the background “   Prince had his arm around her “ also people need to think about this if I hate something or someone truly hates something young they go home and they are supposed to say something if she was really brutally attacked with Epstein and Maxwell and Prince Andrew she would had told on them and reported them and instead lived with them made emends with them and was their friend in the end “   & the supposed tormented woman had children with Epstein and Maxwell “ & never go back “ she went back so many times “ when is it that someone in judicial system says she went back stayed 2 years and a child was made by Epstein or Maxwell or Prince not sure whom for 2 years and something happened perhaps the money stopped or negotiations of money and the men walked away then she said rape after two years again “   She should had left and never returned if it was so devastating yet the money was good “ the power the fashion so she returns to Epstein and Maxwell and continues trafficking “ & the men in desperate need of a child and a love life played house with this young lady for 2 years “ for money “   I’m sure if all this happened the Prince gave her good money to shut her trap right ? So why did she return? Well the money the fashion the power “ & whenever money was being negotiated she left and went somewhere to say rape “   yet if a woman or person doesn’t like something she could had fled went to a woman’s shelter and went to  somewhere in the very beginning since she was in such fear and didn’t and they made negotiations of money and she returned to Epstein Maxwell and the prince for 2 years and it’s not illegal to be with a minor in uk “ 🇬🇧   The news media that shocked me OK HOW CAN SHE BE A PREGNANT VIRGIN “ & SHE MISCARRIED EPSTEINS BABY “ YET APARENTLY THE PRINCE WAS THE FIRST AND SHE WAS A VIRGIN TO THE PRINCE THE media  IS MAKING NO SENSE “ a virgin suffering a miscarriage that day bleeding and suffering a miscarriage from the sec event & a apropos  pregnancy   What came first epsteins baby or the virgin girl with the prince because the news media makes it look like she was pregnant with epsteins baby and sexed the prince a pregnant virgin “   The prince and the royal family will be so smart to make a slot at the royal family door so that when the media goes to ask about Epstein and Maxwell   & the prince watching the royal family slips the folder of the statement of how the prince the nightmare of men  Epstein and Maxwell  “   the statement. The prince has always stated and constantly slip the same file through the door and at then go away  media stop making money off my story “     Epstein baby “ shareing baby playing house lonely men Epstein and Maxwell picked Andrew’s loneliness not married and used him to set up the royal family and bribe the royal family “that’s why the picked  Prince Andrew “ to set up to constantly try to get money for Royal family scareing them “   Epstein and Maxwell trust is setting up the Prince the whole time “ to constantly bribe the royal family when they wouldn’t be bribed by Epstein anymore then Epstein starts bringing out the story “ because the royal family won’t be blackmailed “  keep shoving the same files at news media and say good bye media “    Stop making money off the Royal family leave Andrew’s story these medias are making billions of dollars off the story use the money to stop drug trafficking forever with the billions of dollars made   She was so tormented explain how so ? and waited for two years to be fed up  when the money stopped “ for whatever reason “ I think it was Epstein was arested “ / ['Also my news update the guardsmen seen the young lady go in and out of the castle to the royal family they also made amends with the prince and queen before the queen passed away “']
Im innocent but here is 12 mill for inventing your allegations. / []
Um Ghilane is a sexual predator as well..... / []

Wow you look so nervous you pig / []
Don’t you dare make it like you did  nothing you sweaty pig / []
What a lying pig / []
You are a liar pig / []
12:03 What were those number of other things you did there, Andrew? / []
Liar / []
Because you’re a pig / []
He’s such a liar and a pig / []
Such a lying piece of garbage / []
So he didn’t want to cease contact with him out of disgust for what he was, he just didn’t think it was appropriate to be seen with him, then spent another 4 days staying at his house. What a huge piece of 💩💩💩💩 he is ! He really buried himself with this interview but he’s so thick he thought he’d outsmarted everyone ! Every time he arrogantly said “now here’s the problem” he should have been smacked in the face with a plank of wood just like his spitting image puppet !!! / ["Plus we now know he emailed Epstein one month later and signed off with 'let's play again soon' !", "@roseadams5362he's an absolute scumbag and so arrogant."]

Andrew no longer a prince is an absolute lying mess. / []
2025 gang ? 🎉 / []
“When the allegations came out I went ‘That’s a bit strange I don’t remember this”…That’s a bit strange? Not outrageous, impossible, completely bonkers? He must have been very honorable if he had to think long and hard if the allegation could be true at all / []
Having a woman interviewing him was a fantastic idea especially someone with her intelligence hes a liar and a moron / []
He says he's not the person to shed light on 'these activities' — there's still time — he can & should tell the truth. / []
5 years on to quote an email we now know about - "We're in this together - we'll play again soon"🤔 / ['Eh?']
Where's that pinocchio emoji when you need it ! / []
Completely lying for 45 minutes… he must’ve slept for a week after this interview..  what a snake…🤔😂😂 / []
Disgrace. / []
Lying, perverted, pompous, weasel. / []
It is time the Titled Entitled become Untitled.  Time to investigate Andrew, Sarah & siblings' earnings and how on earth they can afford to live in a 30 room Lodge.  This is a major crisis that cannot be swept under the carpet, yet again - the public will not stand for it if the Monarchy is to survive. / []
Sweating like a pig by the end , what disgusting character an absolute disgrace / []
Difficult to watch, still. / []
If he hadn’t have done this interview, this whole thing would’ve blown over. It would be just rumours and gossip. Now everyone knows the truth and he will never recover from this. He has no friends anymore and is an embarrassment to everyone, including the royal family. / []
‘No, no,,… it was JUST a straight forward shooting weekend.. can I just make that clear’. 😳  What an absolute snake…   We found out today that he hasn’t paid rent on his given mansion for 20 years… but then I thought…🤔  Well if he did pay it… he would be paying it with tax payers money.. or from the tax he steals from York…   Absolute disgrace of a man…   He ain’t on a last long.. thank god / []
I believe he doesn’t recall Virginia ….because he considered her just a woman (girl) he could use and disregard! / []
What type of a person would be friends with a paed ophile??!!! / []
And now Virginias (rest in peace) book is coming out and a new book about him came out recently with all the lies he told in it and lots of people going on record. Coming back to watch this again, cant believe its been so long ago! / []
Amazing! Now she needs to grill Mandelson about his love for, and activities with, Epstein. jew on jew on jew, so to speak... / []
Who’s here October 2025? / []
I tried to listen again but I can’t. This man is arrogant and diabolical. I hope we never have to see his smug face again. / []
I may have had sex with them, but I have no recollection of it / []
Liar / []
oh dear / []
His judgment was colored by his arrogance!!!! / []
So he first said Epstien was not a close friend of his, but then visits him and stays with him for a few days  to tell his close friend he can't see him anymore ?.  And later attends a dinner party he was invited to by Epstien, and also a walk in the park together. Sorry, Andrew, but if you took a spade to that interview, you couldn't have dug a deeper hole for yourself . / []
Pitch for Palace - Andrew painted the palace in hot, black sticky goo. / []
Funny thing is Prince Andrew walked away from this interview thinking that it was a win. He actually thought that he had done well and settled the issue before the news reported about the interview.  18:53 sounds very much like Clinton "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" Btw Does the Pizza Express at Woking now have its version of Sokolow Special? / ['Pizza party for the girls…. He knows']
Everything will come to light! This messed-up guy knows what he's done! Look at his eyes and gestures... hilarious... in my opinion, he's not exactly the brightest bulb either... / []
What you are witnessing here is supreme arrogance from an expert liar given the opportunity to vindicate himself from his heinous acts of sexual abuse. / []
This silent admission of guilt will be studied for a long time / []
This is probably the most car crash interview in TV history / ['Sean Connery from the 80s with Barbara walters is up there too. 😂', '\u200b@ultimatesunrisewhat happened  in that interview?', 'You are 100 % right about that.', 'You could interview the car that Princess Diana died in, and this would still be a bigger car crash interview"', '@carlodonn8983said he slaps women']

“I don’t sweat” was a particular highlight. Never try and excuse inexcusable behaviour / []
The concept of putting people on a pedestal aka having a royal family is literally a breeding ground for narcissists and entitled people thinking they are above others. That's why the RF should be abolished. / []
A  VERY  DANGEROUS   MAN,   A  BLOODY     CLOWN ,  INDEED   A   VERY   RICH    CLOWN. / []
It's so obvious he was involved.. just disgusting how he's been allowed to get away with it / []
No matter what class or back ground you are from or if you are a royalist that man there is  fuckin lying excuse my language / []
What a vile horrible human being. / []
16:53 of course by this he means the underage girls he abused and the access he had he won’t regret that the sleazy bast*rd / []
Why díd he give this interview....he looks much nicer when he doesnt open his mounth. / []
Omg!!, how many times can this interviewer "ask" the same damn questions about Virginia Roberts?! Over & over & over & OVER again she repeats the (legit) claim about their meeting, dinner, dancing & sex. We GET IT already! As did this squirming, lying, disgusting POS. Talk about overkill though, yeesh. / []
Do the interview again and this time with questions about the newly published book. / []
Prince Liar / []
😅 / []
This is textbook humble bragging, alongside all the lies; drops his service in the navy, his ties with the NSPCC, active duty within the navy, seeing Epstein to do the honourable thing. / []
11:45 He says right there that he threw a party for Epsteins release. I havent heard this questioned once. / ['Not a party. A shooting weekend.  No problem']
Disgusting / ['28:07']
The sheer arrogance of the man ,does he really believe he can get away with this crime , if only he told the truth he might of just retained some dignity , this is a painful watch. / []
LIAR!!! / []
His chin and neck is weird. His tie , a bit too tight / ['Not tight enough! 😂']

Rewatching this and he's such a smug liar. He should be investigated. Shame on the royal family for harboring a pedophile. A monster  who tormented his victim until her death. / []
Going on pizza express in Woking is a very unusual thing for me to do. / []
Prince Diddy💀 / []
His “goose” is cooked. Actually burned, way overdone. / []
"Look forward to playing again soon" - Prince Andy.  Email to Epstien after his charges. / []
Rewatching this again for 100th time. He thought he could do whatever he wanted without repercussions. Due to a life of privilege, he's completely unable to defend his actions. The Queen paid £12M to save him. Seems a lot of money to pay, considering he never met her... Clock is ticking Andy. / []
The pinocio interview / []
‘Just a straight forward shooting weekend….’ / ['I want to go to one of these shooting weekends and partay with you.', '@bvanderford😂']
I dont know if I've met her what? You said earlier you haven't met her now You dont know thats implying you may have met her. This man is gaslighting us and is insulting our intelligence. Privileged to the core / []
Hands up who seriously believes Andy saw action in The Falklands? 🚁 / []
Does he honestly believe that  all the  crap being chucked at him that we should believe one single word  that he says , this is one very privileged royal ,ducking and diving to save his neck ,a drowning man. / []
Think Andy’s reading these comments? 😂 / []
He should do what the multi-instrumentalist Prince did and adopt a symbol instead of a name.  In his case I’d recommend w ⚓️. Or 🔔 ender. / []
"We'll play some more soon". A few hundred years ago he would be in the tower awaiting execution .... unbelievable. / []
This shouldn't have been done as the public is only interested in a witch hunt. Total car crash. But he's explained his point of view and that's that. His presentation is terrible and only brings further questions and doubts. Probably the worst interview ever and not in touch with the public mood at all. / ['‘And that’s that’ dude, have you been watching the news.']
Liar. / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender!" Bingo! / []
This is plain to see randy Andy is guilty , the people would like him again if he grassed all up who had illegal sex on pervs island ....Cmon Andy blow the lid on all these top rich paedo,s ......You know them pal / []
In the Navy you can party with Epstein.  Y.M.C.A / []
French president is serving jail sentence. We live in hope. / []
This is basically 49 minutes+ off the David Walliams lying sex scandal M.P sketch 😂 / []
Where's the security detail from March the 10th Woking Pizza Express visit ? Who's party was it and who were the attendees to confirm this event ? / []
19:10 "Trump" nightclub 🤔 / []
They should of increased the room temperature in increments of 3 degrees with every question from Emily so we could test the sweat theory 🤔 / []
If i've met someone only 4 times I would not be as so familiar as to say "Play Soon" and i'm not even of the aristocracy. / []
Anyone else watching this on 21 October 2025? / ['yes', '3rd time this week for me. This will never get old for me.', "\u200b@yootaobe5536Yes, it's fascinating 😅", 'Yes😂', 'Yes']
But nothing will happen to him , he knew everything that was going on…. Why didn’t the BBC edit this like they edited the trump speech / []
"Nobody can prove that it's my hand around her waist... so Nya Nya-Nya-Nyaaa Nya... Nobody can prooove it..!" / []
For all that expensive education he received, he sure isn’t articulate. His 🙄repertoire  is limited to around 150-200 words that he knows and  then mixes up and strings together rather haphazardly. Poor chap.. they say he’s not sharpest tool in the shed and in this interview he removed all doubt to the world. / []
BBC could have had 2 hours of this interrogation instead of 50 mins, not sure if there were cuts . He would’ve mumbled and bumbled until he broke. / []
Prince Andrew shouldn't have had this press interview (at least he should have had coaching tips). He spoke more than he should had, revealing more than he should. His behaviour was like Mr Bean, clumsy & obnoxious. / []
Too honourable this guy doesn't know what honour is. Just people blowing smoke up his azz his whole life. / []
In the words of the great Bruce Rivers, criminal lawyer; " Dont self snitch." / []
"no.. nothing looked suspicious, it all looked perfectly normal to me.... everything was just as it should be in my Pedophile Friends House....all the usual Pedophile activities were going on, I mean, I would have noticed if anything had changed....". / []
I have finally watched this interview,  all I can say is how impressed I was with the interviewer,  she remained calm and composed when she knew he was lying through his teeth / ['I think there’s so many moments he said something completely ridiculous ad she just let it slide where she could have hammered him though', "Emily is a master at this! She doesn't interupt and allows him to waffle on. I always come back for a watch! We need justice for Virginia and all the other women who were victims of these cretins.", '@gatordonttakenoshiat  Emily surgically extracted the truth.', '\u200b@gatordonttakenoshiat She was a genius. She didnt want him to become defensive, so let things slide so that he could keep incriminating himself.', 'She really did do a fantastic job, we can all agree on that.']
carma wil get this liar pedofile 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
Tell me you are guilty without telling me you are guilty / []
I flew to New York with the express intention to tell Epstein it would be inappropriate to be seen together and we should part ways which we discussed on a walk in the park . Which was photographed I learnt later . He agreed so I stayed 4 nights at his apartment . (Edit I may of had a foot massage from a young Russian lady over that weekend / []
Clear hypocrite / []
What a LIAR!!! / []
Umm umm errr um / []
Imaging being a Prince and messing with minors. I would imagine that there are so many women of age who would love to date him but Nooooooo, he wants 17 year old. / []
This guys is a dingbat. A liar. 😂 / []
Though I have heard a lot about this interview, I never got around to watching it until now. It really was as bad as everyone says. He stayed at a convicted sex offender's home because it was "convenient.”  Christ, that was cringe-worthy. / []
That woman looted him and couldn’t digest the ill gotten wealth. She could have morally vindicated her stand without taking huge money. / []
He is above the law. Nothing serious is going to happen to him. The public are just going to have to accept this fact. There's always a job for him at the BBC. / []
How does he know the photo was taken upstairs if he never went upstairs 🙄 / []
You went there to tell him personally that you could remain in contact????? / []
I don't remember  I have no recollection  Its not possible  Not to my knowledge,   I definitely went to Pizza Hut 🍕 🛖 / ['Good call 😅', 'Good call 👍']
Mumbling , stammering, blinking erratically, contradicting himself..he is a BLATANT LIAR of the worst callabre! If he was Pinocchio his nose would be a foot long! 👃🏻 / []
Back here after recent news....oh man it gets worse. / []
Its October 2025 - Now that the EMAILS are out on the Duke of York and his ex-wife, with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.   This Interview Lands Differently! And Didn't Age Well For the Him... / []
Watching this as he relinquish his titles 🤡 / []
100 year old get's a telegram from the Queen. A teenagers birthday gets a text from Andrew ! / []
This gets worst every time I watch it 😢 / []
The face of pure evil / []
Andrew was an ambassador to the NSPCC at the same time abusing young girls. You can't make this up / []
This train crash is even more  entertaining and cringe second time around. Disgusting man / []
Maxwell / []
My people,my team, my legal advisors, so entitled. / []
He’s truly DISGUSTING! / []
I Andrew, to deny the presence of young girls in house p!ane and island Was your biggest mistake.  It's association ..  Plus why wou!d you need legal advice if you were innocent and had a alibi.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
I was at a Pizza Express / []
Anybody here in October 2025? / []
Every word he utters, as of October 21, 2025 is a stinking lie this pernicious duplicitous lump of royal meat deserves exile at least, prison would be quite good vile human / []
I’ve stayed…  1. At his private home  2. At his private Island  3. Been on his jet  4. Been to his girlfriend’s house   But it’s a stretch to say we were good friends 😂 / []
For wrong thing blame daddy / []
LOL 😂 / []
“When the allegations came out originally, I went: ‘well that’s a bit strange, I don’t remember this’”   …can you IMAGINE being accused of having sex with a trafficked, underage girl multiple times, and your response being “well that’s a bit strange, I don’t remember this” / []
Shaking his head vigorously when asked if he’d be willing to testify under oath, then his throat totally dries up. / ['Like in Liar Liar when Jim Carey says “I can’t LIE!!!”']
What a liar!!! / []
This clown is a terrible liar. / []
British police coming for u dirty old man your a sex case / []
never been to the club..dint know where it is..never bought a drink when I have been in there lol 😆 😂 😅 comedy gold!!!!!! / []
I think he should do another interview just for giggles / []
Recent events brought me here. This man is guilty as sin and deserves all that has happened to him, now and in the future. / []
I'm no body language expert not by any stretch but simultaneously shaking your head when talking about how happy you are in a relationship,  is a little bit suspect lol.  The one other thing I'd like to add is that I think Prince Andrew has been lying pretty much since childhood and unfortunately it carried on into his adulthood. / []
His legal team had nothing to work with. / []
Here in Oct 2025, He is the biggest idiot!! I hate having to say it, but a portion of this falls at the late queen's feet. Just like so many other over indulgent parents, she allowed this by not holding him accountable, to this and things we will probably never know!! Parents, hold your kids accountable, don't baby them, over indulge them, and for heaven's sake, admit to yourself when they are the real problem. / []
I like how her outfit also looks quite intimidating. She’s amazing. Andrew looks like a lying man toddler. / ['I remember her saying in a interview that she chose it because it had a militaristic look']
9:33 if they weren't "that close" why go all the way to break up the friendship??🤨 / []
Bad days for a narcissistic pedophile. Arrogant, condescending and deceitful, but above all without morals. He has lost his titles, but probably not his tricks. / []
He answered the core questions very evasively : e.g. instead of saying “I never met this woman” he said “I have no recollection of meeting her”. For example, if further photographs / proof were to turn up, then he can always say “OK, that’s correct, but I have no recollection of it”. That sounds to me like advice from his lawyers, rather than what he would normally say... He used the same tactics when questioned about the photograph of himself and Virginia : “It cannot be proven if the photograph is fake or not..” Once Virginia’s book is released, this case is going to really explode again! I thought that the out of court settlement prescribed that she would then “forever hold her peace” on this subject, but clearly this is not the case.. / ['The ‘I have no recollection’ is such a terrible defence because it implies that it could have happened, you just can’t remember.']
What a slimey weasel / []
22:00 obviously the royal family doctor has said he can hook him up with a fake diagnosis of a “non sweating condition” ffs / []
A day in the life of a royal idiot. He has a dubious gift for making unacceptable behaviour appear normal. Above all, there's no remorse, no simple admission that being Epsteins friend was a disastrous event in his life. And, of course, he persists in denying any involvement with, or even knowing, the girl he later paid millions to, in an out of court settlement. Yes, arrogance and stupidity are the two factors whichdefine the mind and behaviour of this useless prince. 😢 / []
Love watching a real life prince  . Take one to medieval times 😊 Takes one back in time to those in medieval times and how they lived . A reel life experience of the kings and the queens.  Being royal ! / []
Going no cantact    but , making contact ...  being royal 👑 / []
08:54   Because he had been convicted , not because he did those things,  he went no cantact  10:19 talk about being understanding / []
It’s weird that he doesn’t say it didn’t happen, he just says he can’t remember it happening… / ['Because of the photo thats why. He wants to deny it, then later on in thr video he literally says. Never happened.', '@ibrahimali3078he says both throughout the interview… like there’s a bit where he’s saying he’s tried racking his brain over & over & he just can’t remember it happening (sleeping with the girl)… that’s such a weird thing to say…']
As time goes on it becomes not a question of whether he is lying but whether he is even capable of telling the truth. / []
The interviewer wrote an article in which she said that after the interview, Andrew was cock a hoop, beaming, and genuinely thought he had done a marvellous job. She knew the interview was an absolute trainwreck even midway through.  The man is so delusional, unintelligent and arrogant he thought this would impress the peasants. / []
Emily is brilliant what a Smart Intelligent And Brilliant Lady❤ / []
Well done Emily. I think Virgina’s and your bravery will not have gone in vein and we hope that it leads to his arrest and being charged. / []
From Andrew’s perspective,  this was a performance for Mummy.    He performed….. for…..mummy.     It was impossible for him to tell the truth.   It’s funny that we expect him to tell the truth / ['From now on, the late QEII will be known to me as Andrew’s mummy. I think I have just become a republican 😅.']
What a liar !!!! / []
This must be one of the most riveting 'movie' ever........Emily should be recommended for a Bafta or even an Oscar .....and rating on IMDB 10.0 ! / []
he should have put a paper bag over his head ...its the 'honourable' thing to do ! / []
PROPER CAR CRASH OF AN INTERVIEW - PROPER TRAIN WRECK - ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL - WHAT A COMPLETE DISTASTER / []
😂😂😂😂😂😅 / []
And here we are again folks. Back watching this insane interview play out. He was a liar then and remains a liar today. Someone put this guy in jail. / []
Lmao 😂😂 / []
18:12 “He was in and out all over the place” -so we’ve heard 🙁 / []
The money was just resting in my account! 🤣🤣 / []
So smug so stupid and entitled a waste of space / []
i think he's lying / []
Lying barsteward / []
When the Queen died and thousands of people stood in queue in her funeral. I was laughing at the fools. Today I am fully vindicated. / []
I’d love to play him at poker, easy money / []
OMG I’m speechless what planet is he on? / []
What a vile scumbag this thing is , he's got guilty  all over his face paedophile 🤬🤬🤬🤬 / []
notice he's says yes to answer's he's lying about / []
I wasn't there. You see - that photo was taken upstairs... but I wasn't there 😅 a lie and a truth every sentence.  Giving him away. A toddler would see through it / []
I bet afterwards he changed his shorts! She absolutely annihilated him / []
£10,000,000, to someone he can’t remember 😂 A useless buffoon. / []
Watch the david norris interview ( stephen Lawrence murder), andrew conducts himself in exactly the same way. Its scary how similar they are in being interviewed. Andrew is lying all the way through this. / []
28:07- I don't know why she didn't pull him up for laughing there, would have been great to see him try to worm his way out of it. / []
Another sex case getting away with it / []
This fool LOLOLOL!!! / []
What a car crash 😂😂 absolute bollix / []
Five years since this interview and he still has most of his privileges. This guy needs to go and so do the rest of the Royals. Time to modernise the British state. / ['Him and his wife...living free in a house given by the Crown.']
Even his tie is wonkee / []
This interview will be studied in history for future journalists! No matter what you say about Emily, she will always have her place in history. Great journalist! / []
I think he's telling the truth.Reptiles don't sweat,they thermal regulate via the sun. Sounds like the truth to me guys, not suss in the slightest. Give the lizard his titles back in my opinion / []
Who thinks he should be in jail? If my daughter was a victim of this, i’d be filled with rage. / []
Straight forward shooting weekend😂 / ['It’s sooo much different than a bday party.. tha F']
Back in 2025. Still guilty / []
He doesn’t have a schedule now. / []
strip him of everything, including his prince title.    He was there to set an example  and failed ! / []
HaHa, What a Pr@ / []
... an unbelievable failure of an attempt at 'styling it out'!? / []
Elizabeth Windsor raised a devil son and she encouraged his wrongdoings. Seriously why the Royal Family is still a thing in the UK? / []
So he “had to go and see him in person” to tell him it would be inappropriate for the both of them to be together in person? 9:00 / ['He told him he couldn’t be seen with him in public anymore whilst walking through Manhattan, one of the most densely populated places on earth! 😂']
What a scumbag! / []
Lier Lier bums on fire 😂 / []
Who were his advisors at that time? Who? They need to be put in the tower!😮 / []
DUKE OF LOLITTA EXPRESS / []
So last week we learned that he was lying about cutting ties with Epstein during that walk in Central Park. I can't help thinking he's behaved in a way unbecoming... / ['Unbecoming? He definitely came 😊']
Never trust anyone that has too much skin between their neck and their jaw - it suggests they have eaten more steak than humble pie in their life. Also, I find it hilarious that Andrew relied on the defence of "because I was friends with Ghislaine" pretty much throughout this. And it's now proven that she was just as evil as Epstein himself. / []
Lie, after lie, after lie. No shame, no nothing, just an arrogant motherf... / []
2010 was it. No. / []
He is utterly appalling. “My judgment was coloured by my… tendency to be too honourable”?? Please. Arrogant entitled deviant little prick. Teddy bears on his bed. Abusive to his staff. Abusing his power and privilege. He’s a disgrace. Put him in The Tower of London with a mirror for company and be done with him. Ps: I absolutely adore the military-themed blouse/jacket choice of Ms. Maitlin. Or is it Beatles inspired?? 😂😂😂 The whole “if you’re a man it is a positive act to have sex with someone” babble is….positively weird. Look at the way he showed his arrogance at that moment. He was thinking “How dare she continue questioning me in this way”! He literally jerks back trying to control his rage. “As it were”. “If you see what I mean”. “You must understand”. Good lord what a pompous ass. He literally chokes when she talks about giving a statement under oath. He chokes. “From that day forth, I was never in contact either him” is also, we now know, another of a plethora of bold faced lies. You can tell he is utterly exhausted by the end of the interview. He barely made it through alive. “Your Royal Highness” she concludes. He won’t be hearing that anymore!!! 😂 / []
Lmao shudve just stayed away from interviews...dug his own hole! / []
Any sane person would say I was dancing vigorously, in a small space full of other people where it's hot and I sweated. Doesn't almost everyone. / []
The tightest shirt collar and neck tie known to humanity. A great way to hide one's guilty throat gulping. / []
He appears sincere to me.   Prince Andrew may have been guilty of poor judgement, but nothing that merits the scandal people are trying to make of it. / ["You're either extremely uninformed or monumentally naive.", 'Were you born yesterday?', 'Born yesterday 😅']
“I went to see him in person to tell him we can’t be seen in person anymore”….I agreed to walk out in public to tell him we shouldn’t be seen in public because the mansion was too big with too many rooms and no way for a prince to request privacy.  Yeah that makes total sense. / []
Ready to read virginia giuffres memoir tomorrow. Send this scum down and ruin him. / []
never seen anybody else digging his own grave so fast and so rigorous! / []
If it never happened you would say no it didn’t happen not all this I don’t remember nonsense / []
Never gets old. Still toe curling / []
i'm watching this video for first time in 2025 . royal b.s. / []
What a complete arse!!... / []
I tell you what! He’s sweating now! / []
to Lie now do you mean Emily... ???? / []
No longer the queen's favorite son, this drip of a man has just been stripped of title by the only person that could do it because they needed to be rid of this horrible pimp / []
36:49  👀 / []
Quite incredible. Privilege meets sheer arrogance. He done more to bring the UK monarchy inline with 2025 than any democratic demonstration could do. Simply applauding. / []
And to think this dolt thought this interview went so well. What a privileged, spoiled idiot. / []
5:15 lost it. Already losing a bit before that. / []
Jesus Christ, finally getting around to watching this in full. That is a TOUGH watch. It’s excruciating. Hats off to Ms Maitliss for staying calm & pushing him with the tough questions & not letting him off the hook. Can’t have been easy when the stakes were that high. 🫡 / []
The truth will out! / []
The late / great Queens son. What a disgrace to her name he is. / []
THANK YOU BBC for caring about victims, in today's world the media/press often only advocates "mercy for criminals" - every day womens' lives are ruined by violent, frightening men / []
Lie detector text should do it… / []
He shouldn’t have given this interview. Of if he did, he should have been coached and practiced. But I guess he thought he will sail through this interview because he’s a royal / []
It’s impossible for me to sweat! 😅 / []
Ummm ummm ummm / []
Jesus Mary and Joseph….. why the HELL did this clown agree to do this interview …… it most certainly, as he says “it was the wrong thing to do” …… / []
If he had never done this interview and stayed quite he would of kept his tittles nothing happened to Clinton or Tom hanks for doing same / []
I'm baffled how there was nobody to tell this Einstein that this interview was a very-very bad idea. Not that its a bad thing that he literally revealed himself to be exactly the same thing as he is accused to be. 😂 / []
He should be made a "commoner"  Then tried in court.  Monarchy belongs in the past.  They are all unelected and worshipped without earning it. / []
Let's not forget that his ex wife (who lives with Andrewstill), who had borrowed money from Epstien, visited Epstien with her two young daughters when Epstein was released on child sexual assault charges.  An awful thing to do and I hope im wrong for the very AWFUL inference im making. / []
seen in the passage 😮 thats 1 way of putting it / []
This gets funnier and funnier by the week lmao / []
You can tell when he is lying. Evry time his mouth and lips move it's a lie.! / []
HRH..Him Rapist Hiding.. in the UK under the Crown. Perhaps the UK should release the Epstein Files. / []
A masterclass from Emily maitliss. The police should learn this brilliant interviewing technique.! He is so so obviously guilty. If he was not royalty he would be in jail. ! / ['Why is he so obviously guilty what did you see in this interview that told you this because I did not see it', '\u200b@caroleoneill2872need to go to Specsavers then']
Judge Judy shiendlin always says " if it doesn't make sense it's not true" . How correct she is. / []
He’s so underhanded this guy / []
Overdose of adrenaline caused him to not sweat..💦 a that an overdose of adrenochrome possibly…and then he says that the photograph was taken upstairs in maxwells house and he never went upstairs in her house slight problem  with that is how would he have known it was upstairs if he had never been upstairs before / []
Now sit back , relax and enjoy this marvellous tale listeners. ' The Prince that could not sweat ' a modern day classic. Delightful I do say ! 🎉 / []
A corrupt BBC interviewing a corrupt human / []
No recollection of meeting a woman to whom he gave £12 million to keep her mouth shut!!! / ['Or ask the Met to dig up dirt on someone he never heard of']
Are you kidding me?  Yes his titles stripped is perfect. His poor girls. / ['One of them was with him at this interview. They both thought it went swimmingly swell']
He was patron of the NSPCC while he was being provided with children to abuse! Wow. Jail please! / []
Omg 🙈🙈🙈 absolutely shameful 🙈 / []
Yo this one goes down in history! Can’t believe this🤣🤣👏🏾👏🏾 / []
He went to tea with mummy after this bomb. / []
I demand you put the Benny Hill music back in. / []
Andrew: "No, no, 2010 was it, that was it."  February 2011 email to Epstein from Andrew: "Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!" / []
28.07 — Smiling! Absolutely vile.   The interviewer reminds me of princess diana ! Her look and how she speaks.  Not sure I can finish this it’s making my blood boil… he is revolting and he actually is quite delusional too because you can tell he thinks he’s very good at lying! / []
Epstein commited suicide, so did Virginia Giuffre. I'm surprised Ghislaine Maxwell didn't commit suicide yet. / ['She has no reason to if she has family and friends. She is also in a minimal security prison. Jeff boy was looking at life in prison in a maximum security facility and not much family. Virginia unfortunately went through a divorce from her husband\nand the husband was awarded custody of her children.']
PRINCE ANDREW SHOULD BECOME KING OF ENGLAND / ['💯 👍 Maybe TRUMP can make it happen and install him as 🤴 King Andrew! 🇺🇸 🇬🇧']
Well here we are... Amazing to watch this again with what we know now.He and his greedy wife are now paying for their despicable behaviour..What a terrible liar. / []
40:33 / []
This age’s like fine wine 🍷…… and will continually do so ….   Keep digging that hole you deserve to live in …… / []
Boy he really shovels it, doesn’t he? / []
What a lying pos. / ['They are his travelling clothes']
13:41  😂 / ['Yeah, he knew exactly who that was']
I'd suck him off for £5 grand to pay the rest of my mortgage off / ["Think you might be SOOL now, he's skint"]
Back in oct 2025....forgot just how bad this interview was. This is the very definition of car crash interview / ['me too! I asked an still ask myself what his mum thought about it and how he could go on causing harm and sorrow to his kids.']
He had received very good legal counsel, remain neutral and obfuscate. Well done. / ['He digs himself into the most appalling holes, legally. He outright lies several times, such as stating he had NO contact with Epstein after 2010, which is an easily-provable lie, and the nonsense about not being able to sweat.\n\nHe also locks himself into false alibis, such as Pizza Express. He claims he didn\'t see the young girls that were coming and going from Epstein\'s house while were staying there (there is filmed evidence of this, a constant stream of girls), or that he thought they were normal "staff" (which was it, Andrew? They weren\'t there, or they were but were "staff"?).\n\nHe never expresses any sympathy for Epstein\'s victims, and says he doesn\'t regret his friendship with Epstein, which is one of the most outrageous moments of the interview.\n\nHis legal advisor at the time says that he told Andrew not to do the interview. I think he was very badly prepared.', '\u200b@sopyleecrypt6899  the queen approved it before going to air.']
the Puke of York / []
What a liar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
Liar, Liar ... Pants on Fire !  🔥 / []
It was a shooting party, a straight forward shooting party. Please take this horrible excuse for a man away from the country to exile. / ['Weekend!!!… it was NOT a party.']
Yes, lets not look at Blair's or Clinton's multiple visits to the island / []
She was surgical in the way she questioned him! Kudos👏🏽 / []
You have to laugh at this interview though because he really is a pompous idiot who really dug his own grave 😂 / []
He wasn't a close friend but he would let me stay in his house. / ['...and on his private island, and his estate in Florida, and his plane etc etc']
He doesn’t regret his friendship with Epstein because it gave him access to young girls to abuse disgusting creep / []
Crooked Tie and Crooked Lies! 😤 By the 10:00 minute mark Andrew was sweaty 😓 and done for! / []
When you write something on social media police will knock at you door but filthy child molesters are walking free - where is a logic in this ? 🤦🏻‍♂️ / []
What a total prick, / []
We wasn’t really best friends he was a plus one but I had to meet him to tell him our friendships over once he got out of jail 🤦‍♂️! / []
He’s a disgusting, lying pig. To jail! / []
Who is watching this in October 2025? An even better watch when you know everything he says is probably economic with the truth! It also makes you wonder how things would have played out if he had not agreed to this interview. Fate as they say! As an aside the “straightforward shooting weekend” quote always kills me. Pomposity on a whole new level indeed! / ['Me🖐']
9:49 I just can't stand it, it's so excruciating / []
This interview ruined him / []
11m views 😂 its peak for him rn / []
Its like my father explaining to me that he didnt beat me up as a child / ['I’m so sorry that happened to you. God bless you', 'So sorry.']
9:48 Why on earth would he *volunteer* to lie? If nothing else, he knew perfectly well that he was lying when he said he had no further contact with Epstein after 2010. / []
Every word he uttered was an own goal. Hilarious interview / []
At least twice he says " The photo was taken upstairs and ive never  been upstairs "  So..how the hell do you know that, since you've never been?  Is there a sign in that photo that says " we're all upstairs "? / []
He’s just making it up as he goes. Accountability is hard when you’re a royal I guess. / ['It is astonishing how unprepared he seems to have been for this interview, considering what was at stake. He was so arrogant he thought he could wing it.']
@The problem with social media now” , if there was SM , smartphones etc then these nonces would’ve been exposed then and a lot of victims wouldn’t exist x / []
Late Sunday morning October 19th, 2025......I'm revisiting again. / ['Me too! 😂']
'the truth of it...' / []
Safe to say this interview backfired on him, October 2025 Prince Andrew has his titles stripped. / []
" chickens way" ? 😂 A grown man might have said " cowards way" but chickens way / ['"I\'m a bit of a chicken because I\'ve never really partied..." 🤣']
This interview should be enough to jail him for years / []
When I want to hear bullshit, I listen to this video. / []
He is lying. His only chance is and always was to tell the truth and admit that he slept with her. That’s his only way out, but he doesn’t understand it. Honesty lasts the longest, even if you made a mistake. / ['The lying has certainly compounded it. I wonder what would have happened if he\'d said something like "Yes, I slept with her, I thought she wanted to, she consented to me and I didn\'t know that she\'d been trafficked."']
Why doesnt he just own up to it.  The first time was after meeting her in Tramp nightclub (you have to be 18 to go in a nightclub) so just say "If she was in the nightclub she was over 18'. / ["Virginia Guiffre said in her book that Maxwell told him to guess how old she was, and he said 17. So there's that", '\u200b@sopyleecrypt6899Rite.']
So painful / []
Arrest this man, then see if he sweats. / []
😱😖Um um um guilt um um um disorder um um um sorry um um um im um um um nervous  um um um your um um um making um um me um um um sweat um um um mommy 👶 / []
Somehow this interview reminds me of The Fast show. Its hilarious..... / []
The grand old “Duke” of York, he had 12 million quid, he gave it to someone he never knew for something he never did,  true story. / []
8:04 -> Emily is losing it. / []
All this shite about being honourable and not regretting knowing Epstein because of the opportunities he was given "to learn". Then 28:06 he's obviously thinking back to fond memories of  something he claims to have never happened. / []
‘ 4 times a year ‘ / []
Straight forward shooting weekend… / []
I can’t help watching this video over and over again.  How to talk yourself into being guilty. / []
Unbelievable arrogance! He “thought “ he was UNTOUCHABLE 🤣🫣 / []
I'm watching this on Oct 19, 2025. Now I see what all the furor was all about. Who goes to NYC for a walk in the park? There's plenty of parks in London! Convenient to stay at a s*x offenders place? I know the Queen must have hit the roof when she watched that very painful interview. He was her fave son. Andy, you royally effed up! / []
I can't remember with certain what I did last week. let along yeats ago. Dude is lying / []
4000 hotels in New York....but Epsteins is the only place he could stay...????? / []
We all know who should have been shot at the "shooting weekend" instead of the poor Pheasants!! / ['Ten rounds rapid']
If he didn't sweat at the time, he's certainly sweating now!! 😰💦 / []
Andrew is lying 🤥 / []
48:00 This just sums it up doesn’t it 😫 / []
His innocent leave him alone 😂 / []
Absolute bullshit!!! / []
EM makes him look a complete imbecile. / ["She certainly helps, but I think he's very good at making himself look like an imbecile", 'True']
Many people are in British prisons may be some innocent or just violation some minor laws but he is enjoying a luxurious life in a huge house with his ex wife …. Why / []
I wish this were AI...🤦🏿‍♂️🐘🔥✨ / []
Never gets old. / []
Big old manchild full of himself, playing with teddy bears and young girls. What a disgrace 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ / []
I've no recollection of winning a trophy for playing pool 25 years ago but I've seen 2 or 3 photos of me holding it on stage so it DID happen I've just no recollection of it 🤷🏻‍♂️ / ["Oh he remembers it, I'm sure", 'But was it definitely your hand in the photo holding the trophy? 😂']
Just like the rest of the royals i wouldn't trust them as far as i  could throw them the enemy within simple as that / []
how many pedo's in england acritoccity? he was just the highsest profile of thousands. / ['= 100%.   its actually part of the culture like having parties and swapping partners.  Not only in  England but check the other Monarchs across the globe.\nthe power children have over people👑 : have never sat right with the powerful.\nditto power of the pulpit (but they took that power) as the head of the church for themselves.\n\nvery greedy people on power + control.  *** as you can see in 2025 ; children is still "no" from society to them.👑 and it boils their blood  ..... humans with no money can be so powerful.\n\n-------------------- these monarchs can have any adult in the world.   they want what society said \'no" to them.']
You know he’s lying when his lips are moving. This rock spider should be in jail. / []
Sorry when you have those allegations, you don't have to wrack your brain. / []
Lets face it, he wanted to go see Epstein face to face because he was shitting himself of what was going to come out, because he didn't want to write anything down and also phones can be bugged!  Thats the truth...... / []
When someone constantly shakes their head answering a question, that answer is a lie, there is around 15% of his answers that are true and those truth answers are the ones that Andrew can't get out of because of photographic evidence.  I'm surprised his pants didn't combust! 🩲🔥 / ['Russian Bot.']
I love going back to this wreck. / []
8:48 “This could have been an email”  🤣😆😂 / []
@17:32 "did you see him or speak to him again"  "no" . well we now know he planned to "party a bit more soon" 😂 / []
One of the most unsettling part of this interview is the sight of his neck fat constantly protruding over his collar onto his shirt. Rightly befitting the title of the Duke of Pork. / ['The honourable thing for him to have done would have been to wear a scarf indoors and to then remark that this, as well as taking part in this interview, is one of those things which has allowed him to be able to sweat again.']
Cool story bro. / []
Put the creep and his vile ex-wife in prison. / []
Virginia also mentioned an academic she was involved with as well. Or she was procured for so the business people he was keen on meeting are mentioned by her clearly. / []
Imagine watching he and someone very.... orange, in a closed and them aside, empty room. / []
He has no recollection, he has no memory, he doesn't believe, he doesn't see....For a middle aged man he had an incredibly poor memory of anything at all.  he must have a major head injury or incredibly guilty. / ['Except a birthday dinner at Pizza Express in Woking 20 years ago, which he remembers with astonishing clarity']
Virginia, we believe you. I'm so sorry you were abused and gaslighted by this man in this interview. Andrew, we see right through you. / []
WANTED  TO SEE HOW.    " BUSINESS  " WORKED !!!! CAN YE BELIEVE.  THAT STATMENT ???????? / []
For crying out loud. Going back to this interview is a harder watch than before. 6 minutes and 38 seconds in, check out the almost double eye roll. What an absolutely self entitled penis he is / []
We are in this together 🔊💀 / []
His full of 💩 Just look as his body language… / []
Just think. He’s actually abusing Virginia this entire interview. So vile. Absolutely disgusting. 🤬 / ['Yup. Painting her as a liar and a malicious hysteric, all the time knowing he had sex with her when she was a trafficked 17-year-old']
If ever a man had guilty eyes. Bloke is taking the piss out of all us tax payers. The Queens favourite. Posh little randy Liar I'd call him / []
Such a sleaze bag!   Clueless and clearly attempting to manipulate the reporter. / []
LOL,  Andrew sent Epstein an email specifically saying:  'We are in this together.'  and Hopefully we can party together soon. / []
Ewe look at the eyebrow expression of “poor me” and combined with the furrowed scowl of disapproval / []
Andrew popped up on the news so I thought I’d revisit this. It hasn’t aged well!  If any average person used his excuses in a court they would be laughed out of the dock.  “I didn’t sweat at that time”😳!! “I went to see him after he left jail to let him know that I’m not seeing him anymore”🧐 As if this interview wasn’t bad enough nothing screams guilty more than an out of court settlement 🤨! The only way for Andrew to clear his name is a lie detector test on Jerry Springer 🤥 / []
He doesn’t sweat? / []
What is “in tramps?” / ["It's a nightclub. Tramp nightclub in London.", 'Carlsberg special brew usually']
What a dweeb. Disappointed in Prince Andrew. Massively. He was so cute and fun. At least that was his appearance in the distant past. / []
He is a liar / []
Doesnt take a body language expert to know that hes lying .. and Fergie knew what he was up to.   Think William if and when he is King, will go after anyone who who gives the monarchy a bad name. / []
I made a poor judgement but my judgement was coloured by my tendency to be too honourable 😂 this guy is my new hero / []
Is there anything you feel has been left unsaid?  No, but I'd like to take some thinks back. Is that an option? / []
Goodnight  old Pervert Juke york. 😊 / []
🇬🇧 I'm watching this for the first time in 2025, after he gave up his titles. I'm calling BS on inviting Epstein to his daughter's birthday. I don't see the Palace allowing anyone in the party without vetting them. It was an offical palace event. Andrew KNEW Epstein was accused and he STILL invited him and Ghislane. / []
It was just a bloody regular straight forward shooting weekend!  Ok? / []
His huge smile when the interviewer quoted Virginia Guthrie saying she slept with him three times. / ['Yeah that was a little "tell." I think if asked he would cover it by making out he was smiling at the ridiculousness of the idea. But I think it was a little duping delight at the memory of the sex he had with Virginia.', "He smiles at the fond memory, then swiftly realises he's given the game away and tries to hide it, but it's all on camera, what a vile moron he is."]
Lies through his teeth / []
Grub , you be before the courts for your criminal activities / []
Why have you decided to speak out? “Because the peasants will accept anything I say and mummy says I am above the law” / []
You know he had to see him in person just to get their story straight, right? Oldest trick in the mafia book. / []
Oh the Grand Old Duke Of York He Was a piece of work He touched the girls to the top of their hips and he touched them down again / []
"Suffered an overdose of adernaline" what a nice set of worrds for "crapped my pants" / ["The upholstery of the chair he's sitting in was found to have changed from red to brown by the end of the interview"]
THEY ALL KNEW AND THE LOT HAVE EVEL IN THEM / []
THE CROWN MUST GO / []
This is like watching glass sink. / []
Anyone else come back for a refresh before reading Virginia's book? / ['Yes. Her book is unbelievable. *Amazing sections on Epstein and Andrew*', 'Me!! And I am more shocked than the 1st time']
REST IN PEACE VIRGINIA ❤️ The royal family= first class welfare.. Is no wonder the UK politicians don't dare say anything bad about the fake state of "israel" all bought or blackmailed probably have them on video raping children / []
He's a terrible liar / []
”I think that went rather well” said the halfwit duke to his interrogator. / []
"Academics, politicians, people from the United Nations..." all at Epstein's. / ['Wow!']
Emily is a hawk staring down a cornered squirming rat who's offering itself up for lunch. / []
And it turns out he was lying lol😂 / []
Never knew her but paid 13 million to shut her up. RIP ❤️ / []
Ten seconds in and you can see and that this man is fraud, 45 minutes after its clear this man is a devil and a complete lier 🤬 💯 / ['Damaged moral compass']
Oh dear / []
foot massages again? / []
Needs the jail this guy / []
OMG! Whose idea was it to have this guy do this interview!? That person's intention was to totally humiliate him and they succeeded! / []
Andrew was the queens favourite luckily not her firstborn / []
He was very happy in his marriage, he went and served in the navy and his wife goes off and gets her toes sucked by a next dude. 😂😂😂 / []
How to destroy yourself in five easy steps. Unlike Andrew, this interview ages like a fine wine. / ["Yet he's getting away unpunished"]
"I'm being polite" oh, Andy dear, you're ever so polite, of course! / []
Guilty! / []
and he had the audacity to speak about solutions to problems in a community when he is the biggest problem! / []
Anyone else watching this vid again in 2025 right after Andrew renounced his titles?? / ['Yes', "I am after he's being stripped off his title.\nI don't know who he thinks are listening to his fairy tales", 'Yes', 'I\'m re watching after watching "A very Royal Scandal" screening on Prime.', 'Yes I am 😊']
Never complain,  never explain.    How wise her majesty was 🙂 / []
Party at 2:54 / []
Cosmopolitan group of....young ladies..... / []
Surely nobody believes anything that he said …..that poor lady died because of this ! / []
Your honor he just has a tendency to be honorable, is that a crime? 12:36 / []
Why would anyone fly overseas , so far,  to end a friendship? I mean, wouldn’t it be better over the phone? / ['Of all the ridiculous things he comes out with, that is near the top of the list. That and "my tendency to be too honorable"']
What a train wreck / []
Did this guy speak with his lawyer before agreeing to this interview? His own worst enemy. / ['His legal advisor says he told him not to do it, and he did it anyway', '@sopyleecrypt6899 For God sake, all that is good and holy. Why?', '@polo1012005hubris I guess']
06:13- 06:16 dude shakes his head and blinks 1 million times .... like anakin told padme LIER 😂 / []
Awful man ! Should be locked up and the key thrown away.. / []
Here after Andrew agreed to ‘not use’ his titles. Yep, he’s being too honourable…. again! This appalling from start-to-finish on behalf of the subject not the interviewer- it starts with obvious lies and just builds on them. Along the way, though, this man has been propped up and babysat and enabled. Why would he be given a job as a trade ambassador when it’s clear he was clueless? His late mother made a huge mistake in spoiling this son. She may no longer be here, but that £12 million settlement has created a storm which threatens a system she worked hard to preserve - a Royal Family. The fact that this man says he cut contact with JE and was then emailing him about ‘playing’ again is absolutely sickening. This man is so arrogant he has no idea that this interview would serve as a benchmark.  He will never face justice.  The only thing that is of some comfort is that he really is in disgrace, as is his ex-wife. It’s a shame Virginia isn’t here to see this day. Release the Epstein Files. / []
Lock him up the dirty shite / []
1st time I've seen this after 5 years and all I can say is.........................GEEZ!  He is a very bad liar!  Like, one of the worst! / ['Same.   Looking at it again after 5 years.. WOW!   You just have to laugh at such a HUGE liar, who obviously thinks that we are all stupid, and would believe his BS 😂😂']
"Mr. Brockman was there" "Really?😮" "He saw you get a foot massage" "It can't be true i never knew him" 😂😂😂 / []
Here after he’s just plain old Andrew and no longer the Duke of York / []
How do u know it was upstairs if u never been there?! / ['To be fair, you can see the stairs in the background, if I remember correctly.   He’s DEFINITELY been there alright.']
He is a dirty liar having sex after being at Tramp club probably having sex with his kids / []
Coveniant place to stay at a sex offenders house / []
I hope charles kicks him out now / ['King Tampon is almost as bad 😂']
He literally said “I don’t know where tramp is but I never drank when I was there.” 😂 / ['"I\'ve never been to Tramp nightclub but I never bought a drink while I wasn\'t there"']
I love listening to this bullshit again and again. Diana and Epstein met the same fate because of their relationship with this family. / []
He was at Pizza 🍕 Express in Woking on the night in question? BS. I can't remember what I ate last week never mind on that date. Lock him up and throw away the key 🗝️ / []
I bet he's sweating now / ['Andrew needs to do another interview titled "I\'ve let the fookin team down....again!"']
How did the royal family agree to this interview? So many red flags in this but I know if someone accused me of the things he is accused of, my first thought wouldn't be "oh how perculiar" and then proceed to rack my brain over and over again. The only reason you would take that approach is to try and find gaps in the timeline where reasonable doubt could be introduced. The other darker angle is he's abused so many people he's genuinely trying to recall if this one is actually a legit claim. He admits to being next to Virginia when the photo was taken but that the hand on the waist is not authentic; a bizzare attempt to grasp at straws. He also completely avoids calling his accusers "liars" and continually used phrases like "we" when asked a direct question, classic attempts at distancing himself from the situation and deflecting the question. And the last thing, do you have anything to say to your accusers? "I have nothing to say to them." A golden opportunity to assertively and sincerely tell the world that these people are liars which he fails to do, likely because there is irrefutable proof of his activity somehwere out there. / []
His pants are on fire 🔥 / []
Mother knows best! The queen knew her son and knew he was lying and she stripped him of titles. I can only imagine the disgust and shame she felt. / ['The Queen will be turning in her grave 🪦']
Thats me but its not my hand around her waist. / ['They are his travelling clothes', "@controllerbrain and he's never seen Epstein with a camera"]
I didn't sweat at the time 😢 / []

Why the Brits bow to these parasites is beyond me get up off your knees JC / []
This paedophile should be prosecuted, he has escaped justice by paying out millions in blood money, let those poor girls, who he never mentions, have justice. The victims are the ones to fell sorry for and should see due process.<><><> / []
What an embarrassment / []

Anyone here with popcorn in October 25? Have a nice, relaxing weekend you lot x / ['He must have thought the world would surely have moved on from this by now. Yet here we are.

He`s a real cherub . / []
What a coincidence, this has had 11.000.000 views and he paid the girl £11.000.000, Andrew is a disgrace / []
The hole just gets deeper and deeper😂 / []
This is simple, he was convicted and you still go there had Dinner stayed there. What would be the conclusion of this all. This interview says it all. Why will you pay for a settlement if this was not true… you should have sued  them. To the one who convinced Andrew for this interview…. Good Job / []
Andrew is an freeloader l. / []

Who is we andy? / []
he should be put on trial / []
Back here after 5 years this interview is pure Comedy. How to dig your own hole deeper and deeper and deeper. Damn pedophile / []
Too honourable 😂...he didn't want to spend money on a hotel. Free room, sex, food and drinks. / ['His tendency to be too honorable… now, that’s as entitled as it gets']
The oblivious prince. / []
I don’t remember! / []
Anybody here in October 2025? / ["I'm here", 'Hi', 'concerning the latest announcement - this interview is now more important than ever!', 'Damn right', 'Yep! I kept hearing many references to this interview. I was so curious!']
Anyone else here since PA had to remounce his titles, Oct 2025 / ['Yes  , gets deeper and deeper']
The Duke of DORKS! 🤣 / []
What an absolute embarrassment, the front of the man that he actually thought that this would be a good idea, with everything that’s just come out. The shame he brings to the family is catastrophic. / []
After four years of no contact he flew to Epstein's house to spend 4 days with him to tell him he wants no further contact 😂 / ['Andrew did 40 girls in those 4 days']
The FACT that this interview was completed in it's entirety, without the slightest intervention, makes this a unique moment in history. Here we are 5 years later. The Prince has now been stripped of his titles, humiliated, and shamed out of public existence and it's largely due to Virginia's courageousness and this incredible interview. Justice for the victims, R.I.P Virginia. 🙏 / ["Removing his titles means nothing to me. He's still living a far better life than all of us working jobs, with taxpayer money", "Agreed, but it's a step in the right direction. There's a lot of people close to the royals who think Prince William will take it further (when he is king). In my view the entire royal family needs to be investigated. This is not a British family, they are mainly of a German bloodline. It appears they changed their name to 'Windsor' after the Hitler war as a way to rebrand themselves as British. There's plenty of documentaries on the royal bloodline and all their nefarious deeds. I encourage anyone reading to watch them then draw your own conclusions."]
Watching this interview again after reading extracts from Virginia Giuffre‘s book, what an utterly despicable, odious little man. Thinks he’s so clever with his dismissive responses. / []
Needs the Ian Watkins treatment / []

Same with Ian Watkins. They're sick, but they at least did something for the world."]
Train wreck. Clueless / []
In a nutshell, you DO NOT pay an accuser 12 million pounds if you're innocent.  You stand firm and fight the allegation. / ["Hard to fight it if you're guilty", '\u200b@controllerbrain\nExactly my point.']
This is a classic example and show of how British people lie. Everything is a bit of stretch…to believe this guy. Take a honorable way - pick up a pistol make peace with honor. / []
Oh?  Tell us more about the people from the UN!!!! / []
Do we think somewhere in that townhouse/ palm beach/ island, Epstein had a portrait of Andy in a dress and maybe tiara, like he did of Clinton?! 😂  Also what about the rumors of him and Jim Comey with one dressed up as Howdy Doody?   I don't hear that mentioned much anymore...😂 / []
Hmmm... should I go see the convicted sex offender?!  Seems like a no brainer to me dude. / []
Andrew you are full of BS. Listened to your complete interview. I have done this job for 18 years. You are telling lies. High time British Royal families vacate all their palaces.

I don't understand why he keeps digging deeper. Such a fool.", 'I have to keep pausing it to take it all in!', "Yeah, 10 minutes in and he already said he doesn't regret the friendship."]

I need hip waders to listen to this BS. He stayed there bc it was convenient? lol. Like a Prince couldn't stay elsewhere. He deserves jail, and if he weren't royalty or wealthy, he'd be behind bars. "I tend to be too honourable" is the calling card of the guilty. He's sweating now! / []
I’m back here after seeing Prince Andrew has been stripped of his titles 😂. This interview is comedy gold!! / ["Mate, same. Realised I'd never actually watched the whole thing and JESUS CHRIST. How is this absolute melt not in prison? Absolutely fell to pieces.", '@jamescoole  =   Have a chuckle at this & pass it around..\n      \n       https://youtu.be/0QBDFNTi7Zs?si=4g5r4H07SAw9yBNX\nEven reached the UK official Top.20 before the Royal Family had it "pulled" back in summer 2022', 'Me too!😂😂😂', '@jamescoole\nHes as guilty as donald trump but a senior member of the royal family will never be put in prison ,but what puzzles me is if your completely innocent why would you give the person accusing you of rape £12 milion pounds🤔', 'I dont believe virginia guiffre committed suicide either. The whole thing stinks.']
Round of applause to Emily Maitlis. Phenomenal work. Andrew dug his own grave. Tripping over his words and lies / ["She said recently there's a number of things she wished she pressed him on but she felt confused by some of his answers that maybe she hadn't been clear on the question."]
Even after Virginia’s passing, her, the victims, and the public will not rest until the Epstein list is revealed and the accomplices are held accountable!! / []
It’s 2025 and this is my first time watching the interview and wow, Andrew is a terrible liar!! He is 100% GUILTY!!! / ["Guilty of what exactly you do know that VG version of events was checked out also it never happened these are allegations to this day now she is dead she has achieved nothing only to name one man out of all the possible men she could have named The only thing he is guilty of is stopping at Jeffrey Epstein's house when he went to tell him he could never be seen with him again because of his conviction, we all make mistakes. This was in court twice & thrown out not enough evidence, so she went for a civil case the late Queen did not want her Jubilee celebrations overshadowed that is why she was paid off & it is also not classed as an admission of any guilt. She was also going to take Alan Dershowitz through civil court but right before this happened she said she couldn't be sure it was him now he is a top lawyer on the day she said he had abused her he wasn't even there & he fought to clear his name & did if she couldn't be sure it was him how could she be sure it was Andrew & why was she in Tramps nightclub you have to be 18 to get in there another lie on her part"]
here after the recent news / []
Andrew now given up all his titles, he'll be hoping when it comes to the Epstein saga he's now "sweat it out." / ['Thing is, even after losing his titles and all inherited to him, he will live a lavish life till the end. Unfortunate!!']
Painful !!! / []
wow / []
Clear result of what happens when you come from a very shallow gene pool. / []
Absolutely wild that he probably walked out after this thinking 'well, that was a good job son' / []
5 years after this interview we now know Prince Andrew is a pedophile. Surely it's time for him and his low life scrounging ex wife to disappear from public view. / []
Back here because he did say he had no contact with Epstein. Yet “we will play more soon.” / []
This is a man who is guilty of everything.and tryies his best to lie about everything. / []
He should be in jail! / []
Youtube have stopped comments - click to prove me wrong. / ["You're  correct, damming evidence -I'll check in, in a few days, respond otherwise."]
Everybody bodies lying apart from the pedophile / []
Embarrassing to this country he's just a privileged pedophile get rid / []
Disgusting that he is not in Jail. / ['Exactly 😊']
This is actually still a good watch this year 2025. / []
Lying sucker / []
They created this network and never accounted for social media / []
What a bum.  Don't believe this. / []
Tramp nightclub,hours of opening. 4pm until 6pm. / []
Corrupt royals end of. / []
I've read the Guardian extract from Giuffre's autobiography today. It is an absolute gruesome read what this prick did to her. The level of detail she gives leaves you in no doubt that every word of this interview is a lie. He should be in prison. / ['Exactly why hes stripped his titles as the royal family all knew this was coming. And to think Harry and Megan have been penalised for wanting privacy']
Who's here in October 2025? Looking back at this interview again it comes across as even more deranged. / ["Me, I'm writing a rap about it 😅", '@claudeknight8516  =   Don\'t bother mate = The masterpiece song HAS already been written\n      https://youtu.be/0QBDFNTi7Zs?si=x70wPjPFJjFqh7t2\nEven reached the UK official charts "Top 20" in 2022 before the Royal Family had it pulled.\nTime is now apt for a resurgence - share it around - Be great if it made Christmas No.1', 'Me!!!!!', '\u200b@hawnyfox3411 Nah mines better 😂', 'How to guillotine oneself']
And later on that day, he e-mailed Epstein to say, "We're in this together and will play again soon".  Repugnant individual. / ['Why is he not in prison then? Because he’s a prince']
Never brought  a drink , says it all , the tale about not sweating due to combat , just laughable / []
He was never shot at. He was a helicopter pilot, he was based on a ship miles away from the action and his job was to fly out and look for submarines. Submarines do not have external machine-gunners. Nothing but lies! / []
And yet he paid  12millon pounds in settlement 😂🎉🎉😢 / []
Master-class in how to ensure everyone knows you're lying. / []
Best PR exercise ever. Promotions all round. / []
Lol. Thought shitting on the path then walking into it was a good idea. / []
"He has an extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together"   Extraordinary...🤮 / []
19:38 "I don't know where the bar is" "I don't think I've ever bought a drink in the bar in Tramps whenever I was there"......the bar that he doesn't know where it is. / []
Theres a slight problem with.. with, with with ... With the sweating / []
In the light of how much more we all know now, - especially the recent revelations - this interview looks even more despicable than it did at the time - if that is even possible. That he talks about academics, politicians etc all coming together in such a 'wonderful and interesting way', just makes it worse. They were ALL abusing minors. / []
Looking back, seriously embarrassing! / []
Hmm, I think I see him sweating! / []
All the signs of a liar / ['A bad liar it looks like.']
Air bnb or heir bnb / []
He was not a close friend but i had to go see him to end the friendship / []
She should be given the highest award that journalist can get / ['👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯💯💯💯💯', 'Here,here.', '💯', 'I think you need to calm down.', '\u200b@Clubfillerspinkknickers-h2k you given such a powerful argument i will now calm down 😂']
Why did he wear such a tight shirt…his jowls look threatening to burst 😂😂😂 / []
The way he laughs... My god what a vile human / []
12:34 Funniest thing I’ve heard anyone say all year 🤣 / []
Count how many times he says “erm” shows a very nervous man trying hard to lie. / []
He should have never been allowed to do this interview what a disgrace / []
😂😂 what a liar 🤥🤥 / []
Pinocchio / []
It's your opportunity to tell the truth / []
one of the greatest things to ever be put on video / ['*\nAlong with THIS astute observation put into song...\n   https://youtu.be/0QBDFNTi7Zs?si=x70wPjPFJjFqh7t2\nIt even reached the U.K Top.20 (chart singles) BEFORE the Royal Family had it "pulled"', 'For real!']
Are White trash Katie & Tommy listening? / ["Well don't bring race into brother it just creates more divide"]
Was this interview put together by Monty python ….it’s hilarious.. PA is so blissful unaware of his arrogance ,entitlement and total bullshit spewing  outta his mouth …. He might view us as the great unwashed masses … however he’s seriously underestimated our nous? / []
She is cross--examining him , not interviewing him / []
Why did he give a interview to this tired woke lefty I'll never know plus the lefty didn't ask him about email contact with Epstein so in fact he never lied. / ['Because the information about the emails hadn’t come out yet?\n\nSaying you cut contact with somebody in 2010 and then continuing to communicate them until 2011 is indeed a lie']
It was inappropriate to be seen with him But you stay the nights with him He's a Pedaphile  Sex tracking for The Studduring Prince / []
Blah blah blah  Deny deflect decieve  Guilty mate / []
So many ways you can cut his responses to ribbons. He was becoming more and more uneasy as the interview dragged on. / []
And now we have emails😂😂😂😂 Lies lies and more lies through this interview and now the email from the man’s mouth himself has come to light! The truth will set him free / []
10:21 / []
I bet he’s sweating now / []
What a weasel, trying to dodge questions and just plain it lie.😂😂😂 / []
12.45…”My tendency to be too honourable”….I bet thousands of viewers spat out their tea.You can practically smell his pants burning in this interview.Horrible,grubby little man. / []
Andrew had Virginia murdered / []
And never once mentioned how sorry he felt for all the children that were abused by Epstein and how he hoped they would find justice.... / ["He did say how he hoped they get justice though so isn't that the same as saying sorry remember he did not know what was going on there", '@caroleoneill2872 Oh for goodness sake. Get a clue.', "\u200b@caroleoneill2872 he didn't say in that interview how he hoped they would get justice. He never mentioned the abused girls once. Also he knew the Epstein was convicted of child sexual abuse, he admits that in the interview.And continued to keep contact with Epstein, saying they were in it together and let's play again soon. The man has no moral compass whatsoever.", '@anniepackman1383 That could be construed to mean anything this is the trouble with social media its relentless in their efforts to bring people down', "\u200b@caroleoneill2872he said he did not know but he's guilty!! Question, why would you give millions to a woman for something you didn't do??"]
To say hes had to think of it over & over & over again to try to remember it is ridiculous. He made several slip ups in this interview. He doesn't live that lifestyle anymore, in rhw 'institute' / []
Positive action, lol. I've wracked my brain... come on, man, nobody has to wrack their brain with such an intimate thing. He's so obviously lying... / []
"It was a convenient place to stay..." Yes, because in New York City, there was a lack of hotels that would willingly house a member of the royal family, especially someone he'd probably come across on the island (who just so happens to be the current POTUS). / []
“You would meet academics, politicians, people from the United Nations… A cosmopolitan group of what I would describe as U.S. eminence.” And now you know who is hiding the list… / []
He’s so unlikeable and a TERRIBLE liar / []
So in other words is prince andrew a paedophile ? / ['Oh  yeh', 'Categorically yes. He had sex with trafficked underage girls - likely several.']
Epstein did an amazing job for Israel, all the politicians he caught in their trap, and then we have this semi useful buffoon to top the cake 😂 / []
9:32 Prince Andrew claims that the photographed walk in Central Park in December 2010 was the last time he had any contact with him, which court documents now suggest is false. / []
Who ever suggested to him or thought it was a good idea to grant this interview… I know what you’ve done 😊😅😅😅 / []
“How do you reconnect with the public then now?” You don’t. You give up your Royal privileges and disappear. 🤔 / []
Just LITTLE boy! / []
11:53 / []
10:01 never met him again  11:25  I was there for a dinner party / []
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Sad, old, sick…. excuse for human life form 🤷‍♀️ / []
We had an opportunity to go for a walk in the park 😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 oh perleeeeze, someone help me stand up 😂 / []
The interviewer’s outfit looks like she picked through what was discarded by the Salvation Army! / []
When did your stutter come from, you knew exactly what you were doing, the distraction seriously what are you talking about Virginia a young girl you were with her this girl had no reason to lie, you have been telling lies all through this.😢😢😢😢😢 / []
The worst kind of person.. you want your head smashing in !!! I'd gladly do it / []
He’s scum, trash, vermin 😂 / []
Yes Andrew knew where to go...for  convenience sake and for other specifics  too??? / []
He’s so Embarrassing-I don’t know why he did this interview 🥴😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Now hes called himself honourable again hello... / ['😂😂😂']
?????? Hes like not making sense with his words / []
HAHAHA I GOT AN ADVERTISRMENT FOR MEMORY LOSS TREATMENT RIGHT AS HE SAID HE HAS GONE OVER HIS MEMORY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND CAN NEVER EVER RECALL ANYTHING HAPPENING. WHY WOUPD HE PHRASE IR LIKE THAT WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT / []
'I dont hug. Thats my best defence thats all i have" / []
All I heard from him was lies lies lies blah blah blah lies lies lies / []
LIED ABOUT NOT SWEATING!? / []
“Unbecoming? He was a sex offender” I SNAPPED IN THAT MOMENT   This interviewer is amazing / []
As an indicator for how BIZARRE our existence is, I want to say that I come back and watch this interview every so often. It is absurd that they will see no justice. Might makes right / []
How deep can one dig his own grave? A child could tell he's lying. / []
His facial expression, body language:????? / []
Per those emails that were leaked, we now have proof that Andrew also lied about when he had final contact with Epstein. They continued communicating for years after the NYC visit in 2010. Really, is any of this new evidence surprising to anyone the least little bit? smh / []
Wish he would f- off to America too / []
Get well soon champ 😢 / []
The man can’t lie! It’s written all over his face. Guilty! / []
I watch it from time to time as this the best and only comedy show I need about the royals. Prince Andrew... you should do stand up. You are natural. / []
This interview should go down in history as an example of what not to do when you're guilty as sin. / ['💯💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I', '8:48... \n...then proceeds to take walk with Epstein in Central Park 🤣\n\n11:17... 🤦\n\n12:06... 🙆\n\n32:36... 🍌  👀', 'Thing is he came out of that interview thinking he had done extremely well.', "\u200b@okeng71487goes to show what he's like", "@okeng71487 cause he's an unaware, entitled Narc. Just like Rachel Meghan Markle."]
Omg. Criiiiiiinge! / ['Well said 👍']
I believe that Interview... Sorry ... / []
A five year old could tell a more convincing yarn . Guilty as should have been charged. He’s 100% LYING!!! / []
@15:30 the fact of the fatter he’s absolutely crumbling 😂 / []
I believe the prince to certain degree but I think he not telling the entire truth / []
1:41 😂 / []
He will never get prosecuted / []
Painfully stupid! / []
Thick as Mince / []
SHOOTING. WEEK END.  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 / []
PARTY. KING. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 / []
Way you pay her milions £ / []
As he gets nearer the end it's as tho he drops his guard, becomes more flippant,  feels more at ease but as a result makes mistakes and also shows his arrogance etc.  Laughing at epstein being dead, bragging about his work and how he thinks he will be able to carry on doing that work. Makes out he is cleverer than others. He is just a horrible, horrible person. / []
He didnt deny the massages. / []
If he had sex with her in uk it was legal so dont know why they r making such a fuss about it. I know it is still awful with the age difference but 16 and over is legal.  However in usa i believe it is also 16 in most states but some r 17 or 18.  Need to check the places they were.  Why did she commit suicide after battling thru all this and getting substantial amount of money from him.  I know it wld have taken a toll on her but for her children  u wld think she wld have tried to stay on. Obviously pain of it all just too much, or ....... . Whatever happened it was a sad life for her with occasional happy moments like having her children. / []
As someone else has pointed out. I was never upstairs in that house and this was upstairs!  Eh!!! / []
He never buys a drink, i bet.  Epstein was difficult to get hold of cos he was always 'in and out'!  I bet!!  Been easier then to fon or txt. / []
Basically everyone is a liar but him! / []
He’s  lying. / []
He's lieing so badly / []
He’s a pampered jerk / []
Most people here seem to see a man clearly lying. I see the whole power structure unveiled. Epstein was a construct of a cabal used to do their bidding through blackmailing the most powerful people on the planet. They let this happen before our eyes and they don’t care because they know nothing will ever happen. Justice is forever kept at bay by an indestructible dam of blackmail in every direction. Even our own president is compromised. We were shown this on live tv yet we just go on with our lives? No. We can’t do that. There are questions that must be answered: WHY, FOR WHAT, and BY WHOM? How could we possibly let this go? Well because they sedate us. They keep us distracted with bread and circuses. It’s insanity. / []
I was doing a number of things while I was there.. / []
Every word he says is a lie as we all know. Him and the ginger are a total disgrace but thing is they couldn't give a flyinf f---k and will carry on as usual / ["Well, at least the Queen removed Andrew from royal life. But she never did anything about Hairy and neither will Charles. He's far too weak. I wish William was on the throne already. I bet he would clamp down on all this dysfunctional trailer-park family behavior. He's going to be a tough, classy monarch, imo."]
13:43 the fakest reaction ever / []
GUILTY . . . FUHCKINGLIAR . . THIS IS WHAT PRIVILEGE RESULTS FROM . . . / []
I know why those two grots were swaning around central park.Randy was making sure Epstein the filthy sod would keep his gob shut. / []
All the EPSTEIN connections going to be sweating when there lives take a deep nose Dive 2025💋📧🕵️📧🕵️🇬🇧😂 / []
What secrets he must hold. How nerve wracking for her. / []
IDIOT! / []
We need an independent Scottish republic - NOW!!!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 / []
Wow this spinless, lying snob would be great to have in the trenches with you 😂🎉 i cant stop watching this train wreck of an interview,  brilliantly conducted by Emily, he truly is a loathsome toad 😂🎉😂🎉 / []
Sometimes evil incarnates. / []
All of a sudden he has no recollection.  What a bunch of BS this is a slap in the face to all the survivors.  Release the Epstein files so all these cowards including Drumph be held accountable for their sick perverse fantasies. / []
Pussy Andrew is a LIAR, his feet STINKS and he doesn't LOVE GOD. / []
Not anymore Andrew your home is not and will never be your home you want to stop the lies he’d lie through his teeth stammering don’t sweat 💦 more lies fergie you got paid to and your ex is definitely got paid how weird that Epstein died by hanging are you joking he was taller than the bunk it was a cosy talk in New York so stop your lies he’d was dead you’ve no royal duties anymore your a disgrace as a father. Your mother paid millions to stop her son embarrassing the royals what a lot of crap Andrew the spy. / []
Who is we Andrew what a god forsaken liar. / []
7 to 14 yearl ollds / []
If it was anyone else he would be jail... but his the queen's son so his untouchable.... hope he made his mummy proud!!! / []
I didnt sweat at the time but I am swaeating noe / []
His tendacy to be too honorable / []
US Emmenance Traslaton fellow pedophiles / []
ANDREW. IS. NO.T.  WORSE. THAN CHUCKY !!   HE. HAD SEX  WITH  DIFFERENT  FEMALES  ,  BUT HE WASNT. MARRIED !!    CHUCKY. HAD SEX WITH A NASTY. WOMAN  WHILE  MARRIED  TO AN INNOCENT  YOUNG. GIRL ! RUINED HER LIFE !!! / []
I served with this prick in the falklands war. Welsh guards me navy helicopter  Even then all the boys said lock up your daughters, Randy Andy home. Hate him just hate / []
Eyes and words coming out his mouth weren’t synchronised…. / []
Didn't happen because I was having a pizza in Woking. / []
The most fascinating interview I watched was a royal security officer who dealt with prince andrew - he said things about this man that will make u despise this man and the queen who allowed his antics / []
I honestly think that this interview put the Queen in an early grave... very sad, and she's is sadly missed / ['This interview is better than watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.\nAndrew is a terrible LIAR 😊.']
Ghislaine was the pimp in the organisation ffs. / []
We were friends because of other people? / []
36:00 it’s so noticeable how differently he answers this one, imo that’s one of the few genuine answers he seems to give and it shows how deceptive the rest of what he says is (if that wasnt obvious enough already) / []
32:19 imagine hearing these kinds of allegations and going “hmm well that’s a bit strange, I don’t remember this” 🤔 / []
12:19 “I admit fullly that my judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honerable, but…that’s just thw way it is” Prince Andrew mused / []
5:40 he just cannot help himself and has to dig the hold deeper at every opportunity “…and if there was…” / []
So many brilliant moments, it’s both amazing that he was confident enough to sit for this interview and that nobody was able to convince him of how bad an idea it was.  The absolute indignation with how he says “it wasn’t a party! Just a straightforward shooting weekend” is hilarious, like something off the UK Office / []
If Prince Andrew assisted a team to exterminate Epstein PRINCE ANDREW IS A HERO! AND FRANKLY I BELIEVE HE ASSISTED IN GATHERING FACTS ABOUT EPSTEIN, RISKING HIS LIFE! EPSTEIN HAD PEOPLE MURDERED!  Who poisoned QE2? Most likely Princess Kate and King Charles were poisoned also! Ted Gunderson, retired FBI section chief, who was personally investigating child sex traffickers,  was poisoned wuth arsenuc and he had rigorous treatment yet deceloped cancer shortly after and passed away about 3 months after he was poisoned!  🌳 https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?si=ruqThwEpNbRZbni3 / []
Terrible interview ......but the best they could do without getting themselves killed / []
ABOVE THE LAW / []
How could he possibly imagine that this interview would go well? He is stupid and a really lousy liar. / []
He dug his own grave... The royalty my a°°😂😂 / []
Gob shite / []
Wow ,sit and listen , take time to take it in. Don't see it as a Madonna interview but a discussion on life ,love loss and future. Amazing thought provoking insight that I will take away with me and use. Thank you / []
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies...  I'm not a violent person but I've never wanted to punch someone so much.  He needs to go to jail, end of story. / ['An Island home would suit him. HMP Parkhurst.']
Evil  man  disgusting  family / []
I don't know where tramps is and i don't think I've ever bought a drink in tramps when i was there....hmmm / []
You are a sick man..you just dug your own grave by contradicting your words!!!! / []
I feel like I’m playing LA Noire and I’m getting this guy done. / []
Watch the breakdown of the professional behavior analysists / []
Oh the grand old Duke of York! , He said he couldn't sweat, So he pays 12 million quid to a girl he never met .. Altogether now... / []
17:10 did you get that people ? He just said having sex with children <<< the importance of financial networking and fleshing out his pedigree 😮😮😢 / []
Liler liler pants of fire...yr HRH prince sex case / []
The royals are owned by a powerful family / []
What a piece of dismal royalty. Shameful! / []
31:47 ayooo , woow woow , what is he saying !!!!??? / []
Geez! And I thought joey biden couldn't get through an interview. Joey and Andy could form a new comedy team. / []
Snakes don’t sweat 😂 / []
Damion thorn😢 / []
17:33 he was saying it was it while his head said no that wasnt it / []
Prince Andrew, you are welcome to rejoin Society with complete forgiveness. All you have to do is implicate the poisonous slob fascist Donald Trump. / []
"my tendencies to be too honourable," he says. 😂😂 / []
Even his lies have lies.  I’m surprised his trousers didn’t catch fire. / []
Emily Mathis…unmatched / []
"Too honorable." These people are unbelievable. / []
This is like something from The Thick of It 😂😂😂 / []
I can categorically state that my arms don't sweat and I've never put my foot in my mouth.  Fascinating TV. / []
Andrew looks just like Elizabeth. / []
He is SO boring ? Waffling on and on talking absolute twaddle ….lying through his teeth . I feel sorry for his daughter Beatrice because advised him to do it ! 😮 Oops ! / []
Why they dont use psychologist on him / []
Biggest pedophiles in uk while still...... / []
Watching this in 2025, after rewatching its movie adaptation "Scoop" for the nth time on Netflix. Absolute (real-life) cinema. / ["I'm doing the exact same thing, after watching Scoop again yesterday."]
He went to Epstein’s house for four days but only saw Epstein three times he says.   So what was he doing there the rest of the time???? / []
Emily Maitlis is the best interviewer ever. She destroyed him. / []
Awww, He didn't bring one of his lucky teddybears. / []
I watched this interview years ago. Seen clips. Watched a dramatisation and a documentary about it. And yet here I am, gleefully watching with interest yet again 😄  Edit: At 26:25 he really thought he nailed it there with his excuse 🤦🏾‍♀️ / []
How stupid does prince Andrew think people are.he is a dirty person. / []
What a NEWARK. Anagram. C U Next Tuesday. / []
He is a shameless liar. How do you break up with a friend and stay at his house? The prince could have easily gone to a five star hotel. Shame on him! / ['He went there to break up with Epstein, but not his friend Maxwell?']
This is sadly, hilarious. When it shouldn’t be. / []
Bumbling old duke of York, you absolutely bumbling idiot / []
He is guilty as hell / []
Interviewer: "Do you regret the friendship now?" [pause] Everyone: Just say yes Andrew: "Still not" / []
He's a malignant narcissist, his gaslighting skills were given to him at birth / []
Poor Virginia, I'm a survivor of SA very early in childhood and it changes you, it changes everything about you, it took her incredible courage to stand up to them, and I'm so proud of her!!! She supposed to of committed suicide, and I can't call it, I know she was married and a Mom herself, rest in peace Virginia ❤❤ / []
Know how to read body language. It happened. / []
I have a voting proposition: All those that think blue eyed people are superior than oh so soulful brown eyes / ["Hmmmm 🤔🤔 I'm a green eyed girl and I must confess that those deep dark chocolate eyes are ery attractive 🤩"]
The last ten minutes are incredible, his buffooon highness indeed-and 25 years ago the palace PR machine could contol tabloids and the news, so his saying that social media is a problem...... Oh yes and probably one.of the only good things about SM - you cant wriggle out of this. Just wish SM was around in J Saviles time..... Eh King Charles / []
"tendancy to be too honourable"... WOW... / []
Did you ask - is it true? / []
Did he have advisors? - I think so. / []
..."and if there was" - bit of a giveaway / []
A fraud and a liar. Jail it. / []
An absolute child-molesting criminal but because he is a "Royal" this thing is being protected as the whole edifice of the class system would start to eventually start to crumble. Jail this thing. / []
Every question the interviewer asked him he stuttered when giving a answer.    #guilty / []
Not the first royal to be interested in young kid's / []
Idiot clown / []
Where is the JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS? Where is the EPSTEIN FILES ? ANDREW tell the truth for ONCE . Pictures are better than words . REPULSIVE DISGRACE. / ["⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ YES! I'm rewatching this now, after Virginia has passed, I just needed to see this again, Prince Andrew crossed the line with the family because of the publicity being out, and staining their name, but your absolutely RIGHT!!!!! WHAT ABOUT THE TRUE VICTIMS, THE Ones THAT ALWAYS PAY SUCH STEEP PRICES FOR EVIL INTENTIONS"]
Passing in the passage.😂 / []
I love the way that the interviewer has his balls in a vice and just lets him dig his own grave with his tongue! He should have been given a LIE DETECTOR test🙄 / []
Andrew didn’t have sex with Virginia Roberts and denied even knowing her - but his mummy STILL paid her £12,000,000.  Um - why would Andrew’s mummy pay someone he DIDN’T know? Hush money? It still indicated his guilt! / []
A dishonest man / []
Ssstuddderrrrrr! / []
He is very discussing. Entitled troll. He should hook up with Camilla / []
Constant denials..yet at  24.38 minutes in he admits the photograph was taken upstairs at the apartment..That is a confession. / []
Yeah he and the others had no idea Epstein was trafficking young girls, all young girls want to hang with lecherous old men by choice 🙄 / []
Virginia G supposedly killed herself due to trauma they did to her. Right Randy Andy? / []
It's incredible how this man's own antics are such a mystery to himself. / []
Good old fergie another cock up the ass / []
He is far too honourable for my liking  randy Andy the horses are what a knlb / []
It def wasn't me I was eating a pizza / []
Such a repulsive specimen of humanity / []
Epstein was never convicted. / ['Epstein pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute, that was the first time !']
Should've just shut the eff up you smug F. / []
06:39 - Look at his foot - his pulse is racing. / []
Is his tie supposed to look like that? / []

Such a bullshit artist!.....People from the streets can see straight through his crap! / []
If you believe this you'll believe anything / ['\u200b@l3vitarsim against Andrew, hes lying. If anybody believes him then they will believe anything.']
Release the epstein files!! These  Trumpy monsters should be in jail! / []
You know what, those people are just like those parents who lived in the 80s.  Whatever they do, then they deny, in their minds, that if they denied, the things they did would never have happened. / ['Right. They figure if they deny it or lie about it enough, eventually people will believe it. \nNope.']
2025 / []
‘….because of my friendship with Ghislaine, it was inevitable we [me and Epstein] would come across each other.’  We believe you. / []
‘It’s designed for 7-14 year olds in the United Kingdom.’  He should never be let within 200 yards of 7-14 year olds. / []
‘I do things in collaboration with people.’  Yeah - like Epstein. / []
‘I’m carrying on with what I do.’  That aged well 😂 / []
‘I was going through and on somewhere else’…..through Palm Beach - that well known hub of all destinations. / []
What a fuc*ing scumbag. I come back every now and again ti remind myself that im not interested in the royal family and their all scum of the earth thieves and peadophiles. / []
He is as charming and charismatic as a slug in a ring of salt / ["😂I don't know why but that made me giggle maniacally. I think I'm slap happy."]
lol, his every move is detailed in triplicate and put to diary by his army of sycophants, he also has as we all know a personal detail of Royal police protection who detail his every move who literally never leave his side, have any of the so called journalists investigating this wee squint ever asked this question… its a real easy one and easily checked…ffs. / []
I stood on a bee / []
Oh, how 5 years has changed everything…how disturbing. They continue to get away with it, but they know justice is coming. We will never forget / []
Why will you do this interview know that whatever you say people will still find you guilty / []
This guy is such a sociopath. It's really creepy to look into his eyes. That's the eyes of pure evil., and even though I know that list is not gonna be exposed. I wish it would be so we can know just how far in deep this thing runs. God protect all those women keep them safe from harm in Jesus name. I pray amen / []
I believe that he's a narcisst and a sociapath just like Trump! He's a pathological liar who has no empathy for the under aged girl's and the women who were terrorized, sexually abused, and groomed as disposable sex slave's! / []
He has a gift of bringing nonces together. / []
Pompous arse. / []
This man is deranged. Why would he choose to do this interview leaving himself open to ridicule.  Not very bright. / ["Because he's innocent."]
I think he'd make a really good MP maybe a minister. / []
This pervert and his enabling wife still live in opulent luxury while the victims are being ignored. / []
Wait until her book comes out in January..... / []
Liar Liar sweaty pants on fire !!! / []
He and his story stinks like 💩 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂 my good / []
Lies / []
He wa so handsome especially sporting a beard in his younger years. / []
So clearly  guilty / []
If you rob a bread you are a thief and if you steal a million you  are a lord or a Prince... / []
As an adult, I would never hold an interview like this at my mother's place. What was he thinking? He doesn't live there. The palace had to know more of what was going on. / []
Andrew's arrogance is showing. He thinks we are all idiots. / []
Chill everyone, he’s only guilty of being ‘too honorable’, having a ‘peculiar medical condition’ and amnesia. Seems legit 🤷‍♂️ / []
Release the Epstein files, Trump / []
“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady”. — The punchline of 21st century. / []
There are six castles of obscene opulence to stay in but he'd rather be at Jeffrey's gaff would he? Now look at this sordid scandal, two people dead, one in prison, the Prince hiding in exile and shunned by his own family, his ex-wife in trouble and who knows how many traumatised victims. What an unmitigated disgrace. The Queen paying off Virginia Giuffre (dead) to the tune of £12 million to bail out her favourite son will be his legacy. / []
ANDREW LIAR MANY PHOTOS OF DONALD TRUMP AND JEFFREY EPSTEIN WITH YOUNG WOMAN LAUGHING DONALD TRUMP HAD A LARGE SAINT ON FRONT OF PANTS WOMAN ARE LAUGHING AT SAINT / []
Prince Andrew,  can he lie that well?..... I  wonder!!!😏 12:02 . / []
“The most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together” Yea….pedophilia will do that / []
Blithering idiot / []

I am shaking my head after watching this interview. He should have been disowned by his royal family a long time ago.🙁😠😡 / []
Republiken England son 😱😱😱😱😱👎🇸🇪 / []
Thanks to being a member of the royal family he could evade jailtime. You and me would have gone to jail. / []
He's a wrongen just like thebrest of the scumbags,dirty german nonce's / []
Has prince Andrew fxcked any of your pets ??? If not contact Buckingham palace & get in line. Mr bumfxck loves small animals & underage children & even the dead. / []
Just imagine prince of a country stays in your house and u only see him in passing in your house 😂 / []
"I'm sorry Jeffery but mummy said we can't be friends anymore" / []
This interview should’ve been 5 minutes if he is innocent. But bad liars will be bad liars. / []
Best Burial EVER 😝🥳😝 / []
top 3 televised things in my lifetime / []
Take a shot every time he says ‘uhmmm’. You’d die lol / []
This aged like milk  BBC did a great job here hahaha  Guilty affff / []
Are you sweating now?😊 / []
Royal riches and no place to stay / []
What a liar! / []
What a creep! / []
13:42 he is baffled at the fact Brockman was there, couples seconds later: i dont know Brockmann... / []
He definitely had sex with children and deserves ☠️ / []
Evil. / []
"What happened next was nothing short of remarkable, a head scratching twist. After the FBI raid, Dougan managed to slip away from police surveillance. He later emerged in Moscow, where, after seeking political asylum, he forged a new career as an IT and cyber-security consultant. After Epstein's July 2019 arrest, Dougan began posting about the existence of the alleged tapes on Facebook. In an interview, Dougan claimed that the hard drive had been taken in the 2016 FBI raid but that he had by this point realized what was on the tapes and made copies, which he said he took with him to Russia,   In September 2019, a month after Epstein's death, the Times of London reported that Dougan's alleged trove of digital and viden data had sparked the interest of MI6, the British overseas intelligence gathering service. Among Dougan's data was purportedly compro-mising material on Prince Andrew.7   As Dougan sees it, "the logical conclusion is the FBI must have seen what was on the videos and they must have seen Prince Andrew and they must have contacted MI6," he explained. "The FBI isn't going to contact MI6 unless they have a reason to share information.   Shortly after the story broke, Ron Chepesiuk, a prolific writer of true crime stories, visited Dougan in his Moscow home. Chepesiuk had reached out to Dougan a year earlier in the hope of writing a television show based on Dougan's life. For Chepesiuk, the fact that Dougan allegedly possessed these tapes added another level of Chepesiuk intrigue to the strange saga."9   During the visit, Dougan floated the idea to Chepesiuk of sam-pling some of the tapes. "I was surprised that he trusted me that much to show me the tapes," Chepesiuk said in an interview for this book. "I can see from his point of view, he wanted to have somebody verify [it]." / []
the part of he said Jeffrey was suicide that was like he wanna prove that he really committed suicide and not for any other reason / []
He’s the only “constant drip” round here / []
Very scientific, balanced analysis / []
It’s Funny that Virginia Giuffre is now dead by apparently suicide very suspicious to me! / []
M / []
I’m late but I’m here after watching Scoop lol / []
The 😈 devil himself / []
I watched everything about Epstein Andrew and others including actors, you lied about not being friends with Epstein you were caught on camera, you don’t sweat you were a factor in what was going on with Epstein why did you never go back to the United States because you’d be arrested and you knew that, more lies, your denying everything Epstein was convicted off child sex abuse, you lied all through this broadcast you were in New York why did you deny everything going back to see him says it all, stop lying Andrew you still went back time and again, pray tell us Andrew why go back after Epstein had been convicted off sex abuse Ong yes you did  have sex with girls you don’t drink you don’t sweat it wasn’t your arm around this young girl, a pizza 🍕 😅are you kidding your mother paid this young girl your a disgrace to the royal family stop lying Andrew it was your arm around this young  girl amnesia Andrew you can’t remember that photo is genuine what did you do with your arm around cut it of and your arm was around this girl. You disgraced the royal family stop lying Andrew.😮😮😮 / ['Well done on your amazing command of the English language. Good grammer ? Who needs it.....']
the fact that he chose the angle of “you’ve been convicted, I’m under scrutiny and we can’t be seen together” to end the friendship instead of “you abused children”  was a very dumb way to try to prove your innocence.  And he expressed that he had enough respect and sentimentality towards Epstein he had to tell him in person says everything. Any sane person would’ve never talked to the outed pedophile again. / []
His eyes truly say it all. / ['What does his eyes tell you exactly', '@caroleoneill2872to me, there is a lot of guilty shame, but not the genuine kind exactly. It was like he was terrified of the interview and people watching of catching onto his lies. He just looks like a kid who got caught up in a lie', "@RT-fs3tt He  doesnt look like a kid come on really the Royals do not act like us there brought up different to us commoners & he gave this interview to put his side over I feel its unfair to just target this one  man there were many billionaires there on that island but she names Prince Andrew you know she was going to take Alan Dershowitz through court too she then told her lawyers she could not be 100% certain it was him well if she couldn't be certain it was him how is she so certain it was Andrew she was a street worker before she was employed by Jeffrey Epstein she even recruited women for him with the full knowledge of them being underage she has a damn check she took her life when she told everyone she would never leave her children sorry but I feel very strongly about this none of the other women who were abused never said a word about Andrew just this one woman I find it all very odd that people keep saying he lying how does anyone know he made mistakes in life like everyone & should be afforded the benefit of the doubt he continues to deny all allegations against  He has never denied about being on that island but it was a huge mansion & if he was stopping in a part of that mansion then why would he see what was going on Jeffrey Epstein was a very powerful & richer than Andrew he was a financier first & foremost but his private life was far worse than anyone imagined", '@caroleoneill2872I said that’s what I think. I’m not reading all that.', '\u2060@caroleoneill2872 that he is blatantly lying!!']
He was a handsome man, but now he's transformed into an ugly monster because of his dark actions.  Shame on you 🐷 / []
Haven't seen him since...lol / []
I would give my kidney to see this interview but with trump / ["I hear you. I'm watching this again because I'm  reading Entitled. Trump and Andrew definitely intersect on the ol' Ven Diagram  - greed girls and grift!", "We don't talk about the fat orange sex pest around here. Dumb Americans are off limits. They deserve him."]
I’ve always heard this was a dumpster fire but wow, it’s such a glaring admission of guilt / []
I remember going to McDonald's on the 6/7/18 I had 6 chicken nuggets, chips and a coke, oh and three napkins 😂 / []
At 26:00 you can see his attempt to intimidate and take control of the interview, reminding Emily that he’s a “member of the Royal Family” and the state that he gives her. He knows he’s messing up and he’s trying to hide behind his family and his privilege. / []
5 years passed and no one is punished / ['Apart from Virginia', '@MoeSzyslak-t5kRIP', "And Jeff was 'supposedly' bunked off.", "You can't punish royalty they have always been able to get away with blue murder", 'This is just the tip of the iceberg 😢']
“Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, I remember it weirdly and distinctly” then in the next sentence he said “when someone reminded me of it, I was like oh yes I remember that”. Which one is it? You remember it vividly or you remember it because someone reminded you of it? He’s extremely unintelligent, entitled, narcissistic and generally dumb. Oh, and a blatant liar. / []
Liar!!  Virginias death is on you.  You soul is  black ready to be dropped into hell.  You feel the flames 🔥  on your feet then engulf  your whole body  that’s your destiny 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🔥🔥🔥🔥ouch!  Was it worth it??    You bet 🫢😞 / []

I love coming back to this video. It’s comforting to watch a bad liar get his just desserts. / []
Why would he do this interview? / []
As it were. Etc. / []
“My tendency to be too honourable” LOL / []
Epstein was your best mate / []
This chap believes his own bs. / []
You have to remember / []
Birthday party in Woking  - whats happened to "my people" security team - could he possibly go to Woking without security? / []
But you know upstairs? / []
I didn't sweat at the time😢 / []
That interview certainly cured his sweating. / []
23:30 - 23:33 you can hear his fear / []
Slimey fellow / []
What the H LL! / []
GUILTY AS SIN / []
Why isn't he ??¿?? / []
Should be in jail / []
This is such a creepy interview, listening to the woman's quiet probing voice, his voice, ugh..then that loud American yap in places. / []
BORN LIAR,WHY WAS 12 MILLION PAID TO STOP THIS NONCES SO CALLED PERSECUTION,HE WAS NONCEY AT THE TIME OF KOO STARK, NOW HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HAVING SEX WITH THE CHILD, HE SAYS THERE WAS SECURITY AROUND WHEN THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN,HE JUST LIES AND LIES,WHAT A HORRIBLE MAN, AND A REAL LET DOWN TO OUR ROYALS. HE SHOULD BE DOING 20 YEARS LIKE GISLAINE. BAD,BAD MAN,AND A TERRIBLE LIAR. EVERYBODY REMEMBERS HAVING HAD A PHOTO TAKEN,YET THIS MUG CANT REMEMBER HIS ARM AROUND A CHILDS WAISTE.!!!!! / []
From 48:00 to 48:15.  Does Andrew regret Jeffrey conducting himself in a manner unbecoming?  Yes.  Sorry, you meant Jeffrey the sex offender?  He adds, "But no."  Why did he change his answer to, "But no..." when she made the distinction between 'unbecoming,' and 'sex offender?' / []
Maybe Andrew's first clue could have been the giant oil portrait in the foyer of Bill Clinton wearing Monica Lewinsky's famous blue dress. / ['Is that painting for auction now?']
I have a tendency to be too honourable 😂😂😂😂. Ffs ! What a crass statement / ['A complete Sod...the Prince of failure']
What was she trying to say at 21:33?   What the heck did he say at 21:50?  Somebody help me out, here. / []
He applied for a job as a village idiot, and flunked the interview! / []
40:35 Epstein is dead...YES! you can hear relief is palpable / []
great, this is called political suicide!😄 he would have preferred to remain silent / []
He is nothing the way he is portrayed to be in the media He is just like Andrew  Burnett. He couldn’t stand to watch somebody preparing a beef sandwich with tartar sauce because it looks too much like a woman’s.Fanny / []
This woman was killed ("committed suicide") to cover up this scandal. The sheer disregard for human life the elite has nowadays is truly horrifying / []
Liar,  liar, pants on fire / []
36:49 I’d send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love / []
If you look closely, you'll notice that he uses so many facial expressions upon hearing the questions, and upon explaining himself...Guilty written in his eyes. / []
"Do I regret the fact he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming?...Yes" "Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." "Yeah I'm sorry I'm being polite" LOL / ["This is a man who has never been told 'No' his whole life."]
He consulted with friends and family about whether or not he should remain friends with a convicted sex offender. Then flew to NY to hang out with the sex offender. The decision to end a friendship with a sex offender wasn't made. / ["Don't forget the 4 day sleepover.. massages and walk in the park and that fantastic dinner party full of cosmopolitan people"]
The Weather Balloon of Pompassity!! / []
Politicians employ spindoctors to make them look great 😮 one can only imagine being a member of the wealthiest Royal family well it goes without saying that they can afford to pay the Rolls Royce Spindoctors  . . . . Money 💰 talks 😢 / ['Yes, and Emily Maitlis still destroyed him.']
its amazing they though this was a good idea and that they allowed it to be aired....😂🤣 / []
i watch this when i need a good laugh... comedy gold 😂 / []
Well people give man a break! He paid high price for his weakness as man and those gold diggers, prostitute who sold their body to have posh life, expensive clothes, expensive restaurants and presented themselves in high society. Since when gold diggers became a victim? Courtesans were and now they call gold diggers who go after powerful men for good life and fame.  It’s another example how human minds process information in wrong way. Man had fun and paid for that. What is wrong with that? It’s happening all the time in human society and it’s normal for most of the people but some how real pimp who forcing others into prostitution and taking money for it are still at large and that abuse is happening on daily basis and you guys seem to care less about brutality but you go after man who used escort services and payed high price for that. Do the prostitute get same thing as those so called gold diggers victims?  Go after gold diggers who are destroying other people lives. Did they pay taxes on money they earned? Well Mac Donald workers do? Is that fair? / []
Read the new book...Entitled ....he ordered girls from Epstein from a catalogue / []
He's rethinking his life choices now (probably not). 😂😂 / []
I don’t sweat. I have someone who does that for me 😂 / []
Lyer lyer bed's on fire. / []
Interview the leaders of the  Pakistani rape gangs, Epstein didn't miss treat these girl or rape them. / []
Andrew Fitzjeffrey and Jeffrey Fitzandrew. It's a considerable stretch. / []

There's a picture  with  you and a victims / []
Party's with teens / []
31:55  Men don’t forget about the “positive action” of having sex with someone? 😂😂😂 That is one of the stupidest things I’ve heard him say in this interview! / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." Nailed it. / ['It was an honorable thing to say..', "This is how the Royals speak unbecoming he later said sex offender you have to remember they all live in this institution & so what we would say Prince Andrew wouldn't use that term", "@caroleoneill2872  You are being very naive. Maybe you're a blindly loyal royalist. He only changed it to 'sex offender' after seeing Emily's (rightly) incredulous reaction."]
If you didn't think he was guilty before you watched this, you will now. / []
And the British taxpayer continues to fund this liar Think what that money could do for schools and hospitals? But we have to accept he's royalty...disgusting  No wonder there's so much hate and misery in this country / ['Welp…. UK has  to suffer it was ordained just like America will suffer for all the atrocities they have committed especially that family']
HORRENDOUS!!! Just HORRENDOUS!!! SHOCKING. Is it time to become a republic!! / []
Oh my goodness! Don’t believe a word he says. / []
Ultimately this is hm. Stupid. Aggrogant. Aggrieved. Entitled. Our dear Queen. He so did her such disservice and Her Majesty did the best she could. Given this idiots muscomings, our Queen was benevolent and kindness, as she always was.  I used to be in thrall if our Monarchy but since Diana, Charles and that heathen Camilla, then Meghan.  I have no respect left for them as a whole / ['she was as bad... they all need to go.']
Thought it was going to be a walk in the park.... / []
Prince Andrew asked Epstein for 250 000 to pay fergies debts. The royal family like to spend other people's money and they like freebies, king Henry 8th took Hampton court from wolsley  and lived in it as if it was his own. / []
Pedophile / []
A long agony / []
He is sure that photograph was taken upstairs. He remembers what the inside of the house was / []
The "opportunities" he had to learn   either  "by him" or    because of him                  ....  But   5 seconds later            we were not so very close / []
I thought not seeing him was the chickens way out  What a load of bollocks / []
Anytime I'm feeling a bit down or have a bad day I come back and watch this to cheer myself up. Comedy gold! / []
'It was just a straightforward shooting weekend'.  ….. as you do!   Power fame and money don't build character. It’s a disadvantage. / []
He seen the young girls thats why he kept going over there for sex with them / []
Oh yara bas kar his likes are like from what you would expect from a teenager caught shoplifting and sneaking out at night for drug raves with bad friends! We’re not lizzy we are not buying these lies and act of innocence karen / []
I believe Ghissy  served magic mushroom hors d'oevres, passed around  pink fluffly slippers &. we all frolicked w/my  teddy bear  teddy bear collection 🧸 Must have my secretary check me calendar because funnily enough we may have been at a charity rally at the British Embassy I simply cahhhhhh't remember / []
Benefits with Epstein Andrew that’s your own words 😂😂😂😂 / []
How does he know what the upstairs looks like if he was never up there? / ['Yep. Thought the same thing when he contradicted himself.', 'He is a class A ijit. This is both sad and fun at the same time.  What a pratt.', 'one of the most bizarre statements... how would he know??????', 'He popped up there once for a straightforward shooting weekend']
Well, I'm convinced! He's innocent! Anyone who says otherwise is a conspiracy theorist! / []
This is prime British comedy, perfect execution and a The Thick of It style shitshow from start to finish / []
It's crazy they already did a show on this.... / []
Apparently rich people don't have enough to do, maybe we need to tax them and put them to work. / []
THIS PERVERT AND LIAR SHOULD BE IN PRISON / []
Does some people stutter when the truth is not said ?… / []
Good to see that after all these years this beast is still out of work , we will never forget but rest of royal firm are cowards for not outing him and totally disown him / []

"Hi Jeffrey, we may not be close but I flew all the way here to tell you that we can't be friends and that I can't be seen with you. What's that? A stroll in the park and a 4-day stay at your place? Yeah sure, my non-friend." / []
Liar liar .  Feel sorry  for his victims 😢 / []
Being a really good professional bullshitter.. I know this 🤡🎈 is lying / []
The opportnities I was given to learn: Man you´re a the favorite son of the queen. C´mon. / []
He genuinely thought this was a good showing. I think this is the most exposed the royals have been in centuries / []
This royal family can have anyone bumped off if you have fatual truth on them / []
President Trump, a billionaire, is continuously attacked with frivolous, baseless lawsuits.  He knows that he can afford to defend himself legally as necessary.  He and his family have the physical security provided by the U.S. Secret Service.  President Trump knows that Epstein's victims can't afford these protections and that - out of pure fear - their protests will quietly fade away.  There will be no consequences. / []
There must of been lots of people in tramps remember him dancing with a young girl espcially with him being a prince why dont they come forward and expose his lies ask people on the night in question to be interviewed on television and bang youve got him / ['They are paid off']

What a POS Andrew is. / []
This is what happens when you over praise and spoil a child.All that money and a title - and all you can do with your time and money is take advantage of little children. He had a pretty wife and kids, and lots of money,and he’s a very unhappy man. / []
9.12 “I had a number of people counsel me both ways as to whether to go and see him (Epstein) or not go and see him”. Loooooooooool, who were your councillors who suggested it was a good idea, cause I would not be running back to them for advice any time soon!!!!! / []

11:40 wheels falling off / []
He peed on the private plane 6:17 / []
Dreadful, awful man. I feel so sorry that the old queen had this specimen as a son. Thank God he is way down the line of accession. Andrew and his ex wife are just awful. His brother Charles and his slut are just marking time until the next, wonderful King and Queen, William and Katherine are crowned. / ['By all accounts he was very much the favourite child of “the old queen”. That doesn’t reflect very well on her huh? 🫤']
First royal I heard didn't have money to stay at the best hotel in NY he resorted to staying at a sex offender's house. / []
He went to tramps at the night time after being to the pizzza place he got his maid to look after beatrice / []
He said he never bought a drink when he was there so he was there / []
"My staff my people and I"  - what an entitled dick. / []
A staight forwaed shooting weekend - entitled drip. / []
I wish I was rich like Andrew so I can just lazily lie out of anything / []
Sure is sweating now / []
My first time actually watching this... My dear British friends, did you at one point consider THAT to be your "elite"?? / []
This is a train wreck..! He buried himself.....! / []
I was friends with Jeffrey Epstein because of the kind of people he knew for me to make connections with 🤣 Prince Andrew needed Epstein so he could make friends with his connections…. Is he for bloody real  😂 / []
I’m here because I just watched the movie Scoop in 2025 ….. / []
I could have gone and stayed somewhere else but sheer convenience of being able to get ahold of the man. This video is a masterpiece / []
This guy is soooooo FULL OF SH*T! / []
He is sweating 🥵 / []
8:50 I went there to meet the guy in person to tell him we can't be seen together 😂😂😂 / []
Maybe you should do another interview with him about Rosie Roche. Did he send her to that Xmas Market in Nürnberg to beg us for baby food? She refused money but wanted us to follow her in a side alley to show us she received govt support. Did he have his gunmen waiting there for us? Now she is dead. Did he have to get rid of evidence? / []
Petition for Rick Beato to interview this guy, hahaha.  It'd be like meeting Eppy again for him! / []
What a proper noncey chops. / []
He should have brought one of his cherished teddy bears to steady him during this examination. / []
28:05 he had that strange smile. / []
I hope you reading this Andy………you have no idea how despised you are / []
We know he was in contact with Mr Epstein in 2015,proven liar / []
Look the the intervewer, even though Prince Andrew had mistakes about a sexual abusing with young girl but he is extremely polite in pulically. Not only he himself all men are doing in the world if there is a chance for them because men's body is completely different to women well, look Mr. Donald Trump he did so many things like a sexual abusing so why don't mention about Trump? Nevertheless he now is the world power.... / []
"I don't remember drinking, or dancing with her, or..." Alcohol is a hell of a drug.... / []
Due to his medical condition, he was unable to sweat and unable to cum. / []
He racked his brain and could not remember anything, whereas his one eye snake remembered everything. / []
He lied about not being at Epstein's place four times, but his one snake did remember of being there numerous times. / []
He lied about what he had done, but his one eye snake did remember and confess that he had sex with Virgina Giuffre three times. / []
Ooh what a terrible human being, cringeworthy / []
Someone should have set off the fire alarm / []
He is a bad liar / []
What a vile man he is and a disgrace to the royal family. He should be forced to work a normal job or live on benefits the privilege that this man has is not acceptable / []
@13:52 I have NEVER seen anyone looking so guilty 😂 / []
If there's ever prizes for the biggest liars, they would go to Donald Trump and Prince Andrew / []
Andrew should be king. He's a lovely man, just a little misunderstood. ❤ / ['He reminds me of Roman Emperor Caligula...what an honour']
Virginia G buried the monarchy. / ['And got suicided for it']
Why would you want to be honourable to a sex offender? / ['Awesome question! Sex offenders are extremely honourable to fellow sex offenders.', 'Exactly', 'Excellent question']
It wasn't the young pussy / []
From the answers he has given it’s clear that he is involved in something that he doesn’t understand or have the capacity to understand. / []
🤡💩 / []
He never denied getting massages at Epstien's house in Palm Beach / []
Poor man, he’s never been confronted in his entire life, so navigating these allegations was not easy at all. That’s a skill only common people develop. 🤣 / []
This is the UK version of the interview with R Kelly. He was also too nice and too kind of a pedophile. / []
This ages like fine wine. 🍷 / []
Wrong uns the lot of them abolish the monarchy / []
A fascinating aspect of this interview is that it was conducted by the BBC. / []
Basically, he lied during the entire interview. / ['You know this how']
This is the most incriminating video I have ever seen. / []
He’s an absolute embarrassment. The King should remove his titles and mansion. / []
RIP Virginia / ['Prince Andrew could have stayed anywhere in NYC, yet he chose to stay with Jeffery.', '@Aoxomoxoa-69yeah the poor chap had to couch surf because he’s got it so bad. 🙄🤢 such a disgusting liar. That was not his hand because he does not remember being in that photo. He s in the photo but he was somewhere else.']
Every now & again it’s good to watch this car-crash. Stupid snob can’t even lie properly / []
Pedophiles!!!!! All of them!!!!!!!!! / []
He's a pedophile / []
Not I flew there to tell him he's a horrible person no to explain how inconvenient it is to his image therefore he has to separate himself from the situation...gtfohwts / []
Liar!!!!!!!!!! / []
Liar!!!! / []
Ponce / []
I fail to understand how this is still , again on YT ! / []
Hahaha the  BBC junk , time to switch of the royals and the beeb junk ! / []
What a dumb ass prince 😂😂 / []
So Andrew was played? / []
Prince - "There's no good time to talk about .... all the stuff I'm guilty of!" ... 🤣🤣🤣! / []
I was playing hangman whilst watching this..... / []
Wow i think he tends to protest too much. / []
21:05  "o'h yes I remember that" it utterly hilarious / []
Evil pos. / []
Greed too much greed / []
The fact he was queenies favourite makes me wonder what the rest of her evil brood get up to / []
Yeah hes just too honourable / ['😂']
Knew the photo was taken upstairs in maxwells house yet said he's never been upstiats there  lol / []
Send this monster to prison / []
Memories may vary lol / []
"unbecoming? he was a sex offender" IM CRYING😭😭😭😭 / []
Whenever I feel down I watch this interview, it’s so entertaining 😂 / []
Andrew’s says he stayed at Epstein house because it was convenient 😮😮 but claims he was there to break the friendship with Epstein but stayed 4 more days…..PLEASE what a disaster interview. 😮 / []
Hobble the right thing to do to continue to stay at Epstein’s house where young girls kept coming and going / []
Prince Andrew what a lier / []
Whenever I need to kill time I come here to watch the dumbest person in history flop and flounder for 50 minutes. Emily Maitlis gives him the most easy slam dunk question of "Do you regret being friends with Jeffrey Epstein?" which should be the easiest "YES!" of all time and he goes "Weeelllll...." 🤦‍♂️ / []
Brilliant interview .   Who is this ? / []
From time to time I come back to watch this to laugh at his nonsense 🤣 / []
he adds the word  "we" to say "we cant be certain" to give him more backup of his blatant lie. Also the fact he remembers the exact day of where he was of being such a long time ago is obviously a lie. I would struggle with 1 week ago / []
Bless his heart. / ['Ha ha...']
I had only seen bits here and there of this interview but it truly is a bag full of deceit from Andrew. Two minutes in and he doesn’t understand his party joy image? Anyone who watches this entire interview must certainly see that Andrew is in a lot of trouble of his own making. Bring the charges and let’s see him sweat on trial. Yes, you know he does sweat. / []
Le Bollocks / []
The greatest live car crash interview ever made… talk about incriminating yourself 😂 / []
Not a ride or die kind of friend / []
“I don’t remember going upstairs in the house; because that photo is taken upstairs.“ 😐😐😐 / []
I gotta say this is right up there with the R. Kelly interview 🤣… this gotta be the worst lying I’ve ever heard lol. How was your memory so great for certain things at that time but you have no recollection if it paints you in a bad light? 😂🤔 / []
This guy is an absolute creep! / ["This creep fondled his own daughter on camera at Balmoral right after his mother died!   Body wasn't even cold!    This family is effing sick!   Poor Eugenie!"]
"I've gone through this in my mind so many times" / []
When I saw - straight after the video had started - there had been no one to adjust his tie properly, I knew immediately he was lost. Where is the Palace's PR team when needed? Well deserved failiure that could have been prevented with a good communicatrion team doing their job. / []
https://youtu.be/zepm6xztHgQ?si=4pS2QWHY_Yr053xU / []
It's over rino king....you nelson sabor shandu fli and everything in between.... / []
Oh he brought extraordinary people together allright. Extraordinary pedos. / []
Just imagine Theo Von as the interviewer. Thanks BBC! / []
He is a stupid arrogant lying greedy self- important prick! He’s been a public figure from before his birth. He can unequivocally remember when anyone he’s ever encountered has taken his picture or had a camera? / ['And thats his good points.']
I like to be too honorable and I just can't sweat 💦😅💦! Ohhhhh he's a sweating now!!! / []
This is one for the ages. / []
If I were him, I would simulate the interview with an innocent person to see how a normal person would answer that kind of question in this situation. / []
Just because he is a prince ..he must be guilty.For christs sake how will he know what was his friend doing in his private life . If prince anndrew is guilty then all the high profile friends of Jeffrey epstein are also guilty . He has got two daughters and family why would he risk it all .. Think about it .about this interview anyone facing these allegations would be nervous in an interview infront of the camera . / ['Clear your search history.']
It’s easy to forget people who you fuked over. Hey Andy. / []
Who’s passage did you pass Andy??? / []
The royal liar. / []
THE SCARIEST THING IS THAT PEOPLE AND AMERICANS CAN'T SOO THE WOOD FOR THE TREE'S IN ALL THE EPSTEIN,,  ASSASSINATIONS AND ATTEMPTS ALONG WITH THE OTHER CONSPIRACIES BEING DONE AROUND THE WORLD AND JUST GET ON WITH IT  !!! JOIN ME AND STAND UP FFS !!! / []
I dont sweat ! Lol / []
Emily Maitlis thinks she did well on her Prince Andrew interview but actually it was terrible!  The truth is, it was a major stitch up and nobody really knows whether Prince Andrew is guilty or not.  It was merely the worst kind of trial by television / ['Ok.']
pizza express in woking / []
My God , what a mess ... / []
The son of Queen Elizabeth II is a rapist. / []
Зачатые в инцесте все дефективные / []
"I admit fully that that that that......." / []
Often in this interview he repeats "you have to remember that I....." blah blah blah. Sick 🤮 / []
But....What kind a pizza did you order in Woking..?? / ['the cheese one']
Wow. Just wow. He thought he was being honourable?! / ['Yes. Because he’s too honourable. 😂']
And now we know his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell was at least as bad as Epstein and was a decicive part in their system of evil. / []
So, he didn't want to be friends with him anymore because it would make him look bad. Not because he's a criminal perv. Okay. / []
I come back to watch this interview at least once per year, and every time I do I am always blown away by 13:41 when he reacts to that name like he's just seen a dog in a Superman outfit begin to fly, but a few moments afterward he says he has never heard of the guy in his life. It really reassures me that although I have made poor decisions in my life, I have never been so convoluted to think I could pull off this interview like Andrew did. 🤮 / []
His tie is tied too tight / []
Ohhh because of your tendency of being "too honorable" okay got it / []
Put Gishlane Maxwell on the stand and testify that Dandy Randy Andy didn’t have sex with all those girls. If he’s so innocent and all.  He will never leave the UK ever again . He’s already on interpols wanted for questioning radar. Why is it taking so long / []
Andy is a shyster 🙈 / []
Andy is a shyster. / []
He couldn't be friends anymore because he was convicted not because he was a disgusting human being ? Smdh / []
Most Brits (I’m not saying all because I’ve met educated Brits that are disgusted by the Royals) are so proud of their Royal Family.  To the proud ones so in love with their Royals….. Have a bit of this! 🙂 / []
prince andrew said 'it was a convenient place to stay at a sex offenders house' 12:05 and a little after / ['I couldn’t believe he said that.']
prince diddler handrew / []
Bro prolly plays Among Us / []
5:33  houses we know were filled with photos and artwork depicting nude adolescents openly displayed 🧐 / ['Maybe he was so honourable that he looked past it and was focused on Ghislaine.']
his stuttering and stammering is very frustrating / []
Most pathetic priviliged embecile I’ve ever seen..so far removed from the real world. Only topped by his brother…no wonder their reign will end soon. / ['Charles has nothing on Andrew. He may have been a horrible husband and a questionable father, but he’s not a sexual predator.']
Andrew isn’t intimidated by Emily. There I said it. / []
If everything is a stretch, why did mommy pay Andy’s £ 12 million pound hush money to Virginia Guffrie?????? Innocent people don’t pay!!! / []
I actually do hope Putin releases the discs that taped Andy, Maxwell, Markle etc etc doing the wild thing all night long.  They should stretch him by the neck. / []
This guys is a”Fukin” liar, he had Ghislaine Maxwells lips around his tool more than once.  It’s a stretch. Pigs arse. This man fukd everything that Epstein & Maxwell presented him, especially Ms Mattress Markle.  This bloke should be jailed. / []
This is just famously bad… entitled, ridiculously guilty… this guy thinks he’s making such great points… 🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
Yes 25 years ago he got away with so much more..... / []
Yes he is a collaborator.... / []
Lock him up. / []
Its a positive act, he had to rack his brain, yep thats what i have to do, rack my brain for my past "positive acts"..... / []
It did not happen, I don't remember, I can't call her a liar... makes no sense..... / []
He may never have been in England. / []
Gaslighting.  We deserve better.  The Royals and there kind are not a part of a modern moral culture.  Being above the law is dangerous in the UK and US. / []
Little royal prince Andrew does not seem capable of learning. / []
At least we now known what it looks like for a British Royal Elite Maggot looksnlike when he lies.  Maybe Trump gives him lessons.  I think if we put Ghilane, Trump, Epstein and Andrew in a cell together and put a live feed on it that would be a way to understand how the Elites think. / []
Strange! Especially when you consider sweating is not mediated via adrenaline, (epinephrine). Andrew must be a medical miracle? / []
I always break a friendship with a 4 day house party! Don`t you? / []
Just a shooting weekend. Just a straight forward shooting weekend!.............. Oh! Of course, we`ve all had one of those. I`m off for one on Friday? / []
That went rather well? / ['Amazingly he thought it had gone well according to Emily and bbc staff']
Talk about his work? He doesn't bloody do anything except act like spoilt child. / []
Er lügt wie gedruchst!!! / []
When he says Epstein "...acted in a way that was unbecoming". And she says " I'm sorry... unbecoming? He was a sex offender"!!!  Is the greatest correction to him in the whole thing! I'm sure he isn't usually questioned like this from anyone! / ['😂😂😂😂']
Did he get to meet Tiffany Trump?! Wow high class to the max! / []
Sometimes Prince Andrew is stuttering / []
What a MORON! / []
Absolute slug / []
He had him killed the way he looked down was dead give way he knew what happened / []
Still waiting on Chris Hanson to come out and cops and arrest this guy but guess what they get off on showing us what they get away with it's sick / []
Lmfao I know no body is believing this liar / ['I’m sure there are a few who would.']
Hes got fish eyes , completely dead, nasty spoilt and a professional liar, hes supposed to have been the Queens favourite,  sadly your majesty,and phil the greek didnt discipline him enough 😂🎉😂🎉 / []
Your guilty u pedophile child molester / []
You can see he's lying wtf is wrong with the world these people get away with killing rapping children / []
Cosmopolitan group of pedophiles is what he actually means / []
Pedophile / []
Even his tie's crooked / []
Watching this now after watching scoop on Netflixs talk about digging one self into a bigger hole 😂😂 / []
Guilty as sin / []
Being arrested for soliciting a prostitute doesn’t make you a sex offender.😢 / ['It does when they’re minors.', '@mykoniichistorychannelTrue.']
Why do I like watching this over and over. It’s so soothing hearing both of them. / ['I totally agree']
@27:47 he is saying it never happened yet he’s nodding his head yes / []
This never gets old! / []
"The people that I met and the opportunites I was given to learn."  Haha c'mon.   Learn what exactly?  What exactly was so important for you to 'learn' from these people.   We're not stupid mate.   He's so arrogant he must think the public are thinking 'wow he has such a complicated life and learns so mutch that is beyond of all of our comprehension.' / []
“Thats me! Whether it’s my hand….” 😂 He should have clearly came up with answers beforehand… “It’s definitely me!” 🫨 Kudos to the interviewer!! 🥇My skin is crawling from watching the video. Don’t know how she can be so steely. 🤢 / []
Interviewer: Did you ever have sex with her?  Andrew: No  3 years later: Gives her $10 million. / []
He thinks the public are stupid and he's SO smart. We see you ,and we know what you are.! / []
He gave his buddy Saville a Knighthood! / []
Liar,liar, pa*do on fire. / []
wonder what happened 5o that video that was making fun of this interview, whmas it from JCS or what?😅😅😅😅 / []
“My judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be overly honourable… but that’s just the way it is!” / []
rotten guy! / []
He’s the absolute worst kind of human being. Entitled. Delusional. Predator. Liar. God bless these women and the people working so diligently behind the scenes to out the truth. Shame. Shame on them all.  Brilliant interview!! Thank you! / ['America and Europe is full of rich and poor white men just like him! And white women who support them.']
Andrew: ‘Dululu is the ONLY Solulu’ 🤦🏽‍♀️ / []
We weren't close ... but I flew all the way to New York to break off our friendship in person. Biggest cover up USA since JFK 9/11 / []
As an actor you look at this and go "Woooooh" guilty of much more than has been discussed. / []
Randy Andy is not a name you get without being a toe rag!!! / []
He didn’t know - but Epstein recorded his every move without him knowing!!! More footage too be released soon! / []
Very disturbing how he is lying and think we are all stupid / []
I was at peetezer 🍕 express 😂 / []
I just watched "A Very Royal Scandal" based on a behind the scenes look at the events leading up to this interview and the aftermath. It focuses a lot on the personal goings on with Andrew,  the Royal Family and Fergie and the girls. The actors are extraordinary in it. They mirrored these two perfectly! If you're in Canada wanting to watch it in 2025, it's on Prime Video but you need to search for "An English Scandal" and it's the 3rd season with 3 episodes. I had a hell of a hard time finding it .. / []
I legit can’t believe this is real. / []
If i could only ask this interviewer one question, do you believe this pig ::ALL OF YOU'LL ARE  INTO THE SAME PEDOPHILIA RING,, BUT YOUR FAMILY WILL PAY FOR IT / []
RIP Virginia Guiffre. The sooner we avenge her and get Andrew to jail the better / []
Damn that coaching just didn't cut the ... mustard. / []
Pfffff une interview où il a creusé profondément sa propre tombe. Il savait, il a même participé. Beurk. Il devrait être en taule. Très bien protégé. Un gros nul d'après les anglais que je connais depuis 1977. / []
Cretin, he’s sees himself as one of the extraordinary people. / []
What about the pictures of him at the pool with topless young girls??? / []
These p*dos are pigs-all of them. / []
a prisoner in one of the cells said theres no way epstein took his own life as there is no way the cells are desingned to hang themselve its not posible / []
she just gave him a small spoon to dig his own grave / []
If you are not guilty you don’t speak too much but if you are… you just going to speak for an hour. We all are sorrounded by these predators, we’ve been saying it for many years but nobody is talking serious. they can wash their hands and nobody will ever judge them, it’s just a show for us. / []
Vladimir putin has the files to expose him / []
A man with daughters stays at a rapist house OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOk / []
Does “delighted to be here” look different in England than the U.S.? / []
Why didn't the Palm Beach police department investigate Prince Andrew when they were investigating Jeffrey Epstein? There are so many witness that say Prince Andrew was getting "massages" from the same girls as Epstein. / []
The more one listens to this and he’s paid £12m to a woman who he’s never met , happy to call a liar a liar? / []
You would meet lots of interesting kiddies ? / []
Guilty or not and only Prince Andrew knows the truth. But I don’t like the way the interviewer addresses the Prince. / []
All pedos should be castrated / ['Definitely the damage they do... My dad always said that. Only way.. Vermin']
I hope Epstein had sex with Andrew’s daughters when they were underage / []
What a low life / []
Lock up, Trump. / []
Lock up, Andrew the pedophile. / []
What the h?? U can do easily see through the lies / []
"tendency to be too honorable" / []
To believe Andrew characterization of Epstein, is to believe MI6 are incompetent. / []
What an arrogant  dick head / []
I don't sweat . Or I didn't sweat. / []
I've said consistently and frequently I don't remember breaking into the bank and stealing all the money. / []
The Royal liar. / []
" it's done for 7 to 14 yr old in Britain but I believe its done from 5 to 95 around the world " !    So my question is  what's  IT  ?   One of the  " things "  Andrew is doing right now  he couldn't remember the others 😂😂😂😂   just one of the ridiculous things he come out with in his nervous over explanation answers he gave to a simple question . Just thought I'd watch it again to show a mate who hadnt sen it and it was just as hilarious this time 😂😂😂. Dya think he regretted doing this interview 😂😂thats  narcissism for you 😂 / []
August 2025... I wish they would have done this interview with Donald Trump before his reelection!  Would have saved the world from the most crazy and dangerous times we're in right now. She would have done a great job with finishing him off as she did so well here 👏 / []
What a terrible liar. Not a single thing he said rang true. / []
#wethepeople #belivethevictims #releasetheepstei files / []
Came back for a third viewing. So classic lol / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
Why he's not in jail? Royal impunity / []
Disgusting scumbag / []
Lol he never broke up his friendship with epstein. / []

(Again) 24:28 I don't remember going upstairs in the house because that photograph was taken upstairs (if Andrew never went upstairs then how the hell could you identify that it's upstairs 🤡) 24:58 Because I have no recollection of that photograph ever being taken. (AGAIN) 28:07 watch the expressions 28:15 How did he know the date it's in April?? 28:52 "So I DON'T think that COULD HAVE happened at all."

(indicating that if he had sex with any underage girl he would've definitely remembered it coz it's a positive act 🤢) 32:13 I've wracked my brain and thinking oh… when the first allegations, when the allegations came out originally I went well that's a bit strange, I don't remember this and then I've been through it and through it and through it over and over and over again and no, nothing. (WHY THE HELL WOULD U NEED TO THINK THIS MUCH, YOU EITHER HAD SEX OR NOT, IT'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN. THE ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT YOU DID HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE SIMILAR, UNDERAGE GIRL BUT THAT'S NOT VIRGINIA OR YOU HAD SEX WITH SO MANY UNDERAGE GIRLS THAT YOU CANNOT PIN POINT IF VIRGINIA WAS ONE AMONG THEM OR NOT) 32:45 Four times a year? 🤡 (His implication being I've visited Epstein's Florida residence but not that many times) 34:24 to 36:29 Andrew says he never find anything suspicious, all the time he was with Jeffrey Epstein. 36:33 Will Andrew testify under oath?

How does he know the photo with Virginia Giuffre was taken on the second floor if he has never been there ??? / ['Trump, Epstein, Andrew, Diddy.. etc']
Andy says he was at a birthday pizza express in Woking on 10 March when Virginia says he had sex with her. Beatrice birthday is on 8 August and Eugenie birthday is 23 March. Whose birthday would cause him to go to such an unusual place if it wasn’t one of his daughters? / []
He’s such a smug prick! And the queen cuddled him and his disgusting behavior / []
Liar! Dirty pedophile. God why did anyone let him go on tv and do this interview? It made everything worse. Queen must be questioning why she birthed this fool. / []

I have been a graphic designer for 39 years, I have instructed on how to perform photo editing, digitally and with an airbrush physically....  Looking at the photo... One can see his arm between his abdomen and her right lateral side. The arm length, colour, texture, value, specularity, positioning is all correct for a photograph not being altered. The hairline between shirt and tank top is correct. The wall showing between them is correctly lit et al. Her head/face has not been inserted. The red eye shared between the subjects of the photo is correct. The reflection of the girl's hair in the window is correct as well as her height. The flash interaction between the reflection and the highlight is correct. Shadow from  male projected to female on lower right lateral side is correct.  This image is unaltered. Nothing stands out.   Am 98% sure. Would need original to be 2 % more sure, or to see the emulsion / []
While it's not a direct symptom, PTSD can indirectly affect perspiration. Individuals with PTSD may experience sweating as a physical symptom of anxiety and stress, and the body's stress response can also lead to less perspiration in certain situations. However, PTSD doesn't cause a complete inability to sweat / []

Well sorry to say this Andy pandy, but your a really shite actor and unfortunately you've not got the part of privileged lying sack of shite. But 'NO SWEAT' can you get 12M from mummy pig (AKA British tax payer) to make all this nonsense from a girl you never met to go away? Fookin unreal! / []
Not regretting meeting him because of the opportunities he was given ... says the son of the queen of England. Yeah dude to make an omelette you have to break some eggs ... someone gets raped along the way but yeah its all about the connections and the networking... / []
Egal ob Club oder doch Pizzeria, wo sind die evtl. Zeugen und Kameraauswertungen? / []
Car crash / []
2025  Convenient royalty denial.  I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO have BEEN A FLY ON HIS WALL WHEN HE TALKED TO MOMMY!!! / []
You are sexual attacker / []
So stupid and self incriminating it’s almost comical. / []
I HAD to go and see him I HAD to… but in general he’s Ghilaine’s plus one.  I cannot remember most people and most events but I can remember that it WASNT that night.   I have ABSOLUTELY no memory of that photo. I don’t remember that photo and I don’t know if it’s my hand. But I REMEMBER I have never been upstairs.   What a train wreck… telling the world he’s guilty ALL THE WAY all the way!!! / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 @13:42…..his face look like this 😳😳 / []
This interview is incredible. I’ve watched it multiple times over the years but 5 years later holy pedophile Batman! / []
It's like a Professor interviewing an 8 year old. / []
I’m getting the word ………. / []
Holy Mary!!! Rewatching this…a country that allows old men to rape its children is lost.  We’ve lost our souls on both sides of the pond. / []
Andrew is too honorable for us mortals. / []
Sorry mate, don't believe you. / []
Come off it, Andrew. / []
..but you know "upstairs". / []
Lots of witnesses in the post office inquiry could not remember when convenient - but then can recall specific dates - seems familiar. / []
But you are sweating now. / []
What a disaster. / []
Did no one advise Andrew - seems improbable. - as so much else Andrew says in the interview. / []
Sounds like Trump / []
20:02: I don't know where the bar in Tramps is... When I was in Tramps, I never bought drinks" / []
13:43 the moment, all fell together. The Royalities finally crashed / []
"It was a convenient place to stay" 😮😅 / []
10:25: "he didn't go into great depths of about I...äh...he was doing..."😮😅 / []
Scum / []
absolutely excruciating -- and he had his own young daughters -- what a total deef. / []
Maitlis: - "ok, who ate all the rubbish in the bin and made a big poopoo on the sofa?" Andrew: - "noonoononono" / []
Wow. In reflecting on this interview and scandal, especially as the Epstein Scandal re-emerges in the US, I'm struck by the fact that, following this interview, neither the press nor the public were not convinced by Prince Andrew's interview; rather, his responses had the opposite effect and intensified existing concerns. The interview was widely described as a "car crash" and a "disaster" because of several key factors:  Lack of Empathy and Responsibility Andrew's tone throughout the interview was seen as self-absorbed and lacking in empathy for Jeffrey Epstein's victims. He did not express any compassion for them and instead focused on the impact the scandal had on him, his family, and his reputation. This was a critical failure, as it alienated a public that was already concerned with the serious nature of the allegations. His use of the word "unbecoming" to describe Epstein's actions was seen as a gross understatement, further highlighting his perceived disconnect from the gravity of the crimes.  Inconsistent and Unbelievable Excuses The prince's explanations for his behavior were met with widespread disbelief and ridicule. The most notorious examples include:  1) The Pizza Express alibi: He claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on the day he was alleged to have had sex with Virginia Giuffre. This highly specific and mundane alibi was seen as bizarre and unconvincing.  2) The "inability to sweat": When confronted with Giuffre's claim that he was "sweating profusely" while dancing at a London nightclub, Andrew claimed a past medical condition related to an "adrenaline overdose" from the Falklands War had left him unable to sweat. This response was widely mocked and seen as a desperate and outlandish excuse.  3) Staying at Epstein's home: He defended staying at Epstein's house in New York after Epstein had already been convicted of a sex offense by saying it was a "convenient" place to stay. This showed a startling lack of judgment and was seen as a weak justification for maintaining a relationship with a known sex offender.   A Failure to Achieve the Interview's Goal Instead of clearing his name, the interview seemed to confirm many people's suspicions. The combination of his defensive body language, his vague denials, and his specific, yet unbelievable, excuses did more to raise questions than to answer them. A public relations expert noted that Andrew "made it much worse" and "gave more oxygen to that story," ultimately leading to him stepping back from public duties just four days after the interview aired. / []
The sweating thing is so bizarre and outlandish that I wonder if there's some truth to it. Otherwise, why on earth would that excuse come to his mind? / ['There’s absolutely no “medical condition” that restricts one from sweating… hilarious. What a catastrophe is this!', '@ntripathi3435~ Actually there are conditions that can restrict sweating. But his excuse of "adrenaline" is not one of them.']
And we are told that Harry & Meghan are the worst 😅😂😂😂😂 / []
Anybody else....... Prison.... Fact... 🇬🇧🇬🇧 / []
OMG🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Release the Epstein files. / []
I’m rewatching this train wreck to make sure I heard it right five years ago… He had no contact - zero - with JE during the time his ‘not terribly close friend’ was imprisoned from 2006-2010. So why would PA feel it necessary to speak personally with JE to break up with him in 2010? All his talk about his contact with JE being because of his friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell. That hasn’t aged well either, Randy Andy. This disgusting predator is a stain to her late Queen Elizabeth II’s memory. / []
17 IS still UNDERAGE she was just a kid a child , what he did was beneath contempt he could have went to the tower for that , reminds me of what happened to my own Great Grand Mother :( was that same age really annoying / []
old sweaty bollocks andy / []
above all else he let his Mother down , the Queen was different class to him as an individual / []
Epstein did NOT "s u i c i d e" / []
NASTY SWINGER ANDREW PEDOPHILE / []
Andy was on a very sticky wicket right from the get go / []
Nasty man. He has daughters. What if! / []
40:37 weird / []
release the files!! / []
What above transaction on his card on those dates???   I think he had an amnesia drug in his system possibly. / []
Could there be negatives of that photo ? Maybe another photo some where of that photo or a stranger that took a photo at the bar where they were dancing of on the street walking? / []
Did they ever look for the receipts from that bar??? Were there witnesses besides Virginia?   I thought maybe he drank too much of had drugs in his system.      I’m trying to figure out the whys and the no memories? / []
"No recollection.  Didn't happen."  ". . . absolutely, categorically DIDN'T HAPPEN . . . "  Which is it, Donald (err, Prince Andrew)?  Total sketch.  It would be funny,  but for the fact that "one" would have to be oblivious to the severe abuse perpetrated on young women and underage girls. / []
The royal palace is massive hot spot for sex offenders to hang out in / []
I did nothing wrong but here’s a lovely £12,000,000 🤣🤣 / []
I haven't read this elsewhere, so I'll add this comment: He gives as a significant part of the reason for seeking time with JE the "fact" that he was transitioning out of the Navy and was spending most of his time at sea. Have a peep at his career progression. He spent very, very little time at sea for the last several years of his naval career... He was largely shore-based. Unless .... He is inadvertently admitting that he was in regular touch with Epstein YEARS before he admits to. Hmmm... Tricky business, lying. When you are a public figure, you leave a very clear trail. / []
This is like a little Britain sketch featuring Vicky Pollard: "yeah but i couldn't have done it could I because i asnt even there was I?  I was in the kebab shop with Sharon and Michelle  Sharon let Darren Smith finger her cos she's a slag. Nah but  ; even if I was there I couldn't have done it because I've got a rare medical condition askSharon and if she says I ain't she's a lying slag and gonna get beatings 😂 / []

This is just one member of the royal family, one member of the ultra rich, powerful and influential. Just imagine how many more of them are doing this in private. / ['Stfu', "That's why the files are being suppressed. There are too many rich and powerful people on it. Epstein isn't the only one doing this either."]
Reveal the file and let the sun shine into this dark place of the world. / ['yes', 'It’ll never happen and even if it did, they’ve had more than enough time now to redact the information. \nLet’s be real.']
A symptom of adrenal fatigue is excessive sweating. He got that wrong. / []
13:41 / []
I was literally mocking him aloud by saying “actually, that couldn’t be me because I don’t sweat”.. and then he said it.. unbelievable / []
Bunch of rich scum / ['In the words of George Carlin, "Its a club and you aren\'t in it"!']
He should stick to flying helicopters in the middle of the ocean as being anyone else is proof he’s way outa his league being a royal / []
😂😂😂😂😂Ai tempi di Enrico 8 erano all'ordine del giorno queste cose, non capisco di che si stupiscono oggi.. Assurdo e ridicolo lui che nega, c'è una una foto molto chiara con questa ragazza!! Ma questo non conosce vergogna 😂😂povera moglie e povere figlie, chissà come si vergognano / []
Convenient place to stay. Old mate is portraying he was couch surfing... come on you could stay in any swanky hotel he wants. Catch helicopters, private jets and the most high end cars with bullet and explosive protection. / []
Entitled, spoilt, self absorbed, narcissist, delusional, rude, compulsive liar, s*xual abuser, dumm AF!! The List is probably longer!! Ps arrogant!! / []
He’s as crooked as his tie! / []
He’s a horrible liar! / ['Better than Trump as a liar, Clinton is better than both of them, yet all are free with no consequences for their actions.']
The best time to talk about it, would be at the requested appointment, with the FBI, Andy!  No sweat. 💦 / []
I love the defense of, “I went one more time to see him to tell him I cannot see him! What an absolute arrogant person to think people accept that answer. / []
Pdophile pig / []
you don't fork out $17mil when you are telling the truth / []
He s in "collaboration" / []
The old " Woking" alibi ruse / []
"useful" / []
Always convenient / []
This interview can be used as a look at a lier lesson / []
Keep sharing until justice is served. / []
I hope this POS comes here to look and see what the comments are. I hope he and his disgusting grifter ex-wife see them together. I feel desperately sorry for their daughters. They seem like nice girls. However, the Queen raised this monstrous piece of dog dung...the Monarchy has to go. As a Canadian I have always been proud of the Monarchy, the Commonwealth..now I see it as the malignancy it is / ["Eugenie is friends with Hairy and Megain so I don't think she's that nice."]
This royal trash thinks that we are as guillable as the little girls he abused. / []
His so full of shite back pedaling / []
“Unbecoming” / []
Speechless / []
You see I cannot sweat  Because I was shot at in the faulklan island  It's called pinnochiotetitis / []
I’m sure he lost a few pounds during the interview ! / []
The woman he had creepy hands around has taken her life. Don't know how this guy sleeps at night. / []
"I never have, really, partied." / []
He is as thick as pig sh-t... / []
his iq is bellow zero ... he should not talk in public ... he has absolutely nothing to say ... if i watch his eyes ... low iq ... nothing royal ... / []
epstein is guilty that this most wonderful prince had his schnäbeli not under control ... i used swiss german ... que dieu me pardonne ... by the way ... epstein and sir andrew took the same entry/exit central park/park avenue when i went to the frick collection ... the residence of epstein is in the neighbour building of frick collection ... can someone tell me what iq this most wonderful prince has, i studied at sorbonne etc. etc. / []
His nose is getting longer and longer / []
William has a lot of block chopping when he takes over. / []
Andrew is a jerk...arrogant and entitled!!! This interview shows how much he lies...Virginia committed suicide...you played a role in that! Go and hide...your Mum knew what you did...You are a pedofile. We know now you lied!!! You had to pay off Virginia...we saw the photos!! Your mum took away all of your royal duties and sent you to a place that left you out of the royal family... / []
How can this pathetic specimen of a man sit there and expect people to swallow his bullshit...! / []
He underestimates our intelligence...You can't lie to the whole world Andrew...Even the body language screams liar liar / []
DONALD TRUMP IS ON THE LIST / ['Epstein has been interviewed as saying they were best friends. I’m guessing there’s more to it than a couple visits to the island', '100% and wish he could be held accountable like this POS, Bill Clinton is probably guilty as well.']
Rewatching is sadder knowing Virginia died by suicide at 41. The Queen was complicit as she paid £12 million so Andrew could avoid court. The British establishment prioritzed desperate self-interest over justice and recognition for those very traumatised child victims. / ['100% correct sir.']
He should go to jail. / []
This is my first time watching the interview and THIS IS WILD. This guy is 100% guilty, holy moly. / ["Unbelievable isn't it", 'He should be in prison.', '\u200b@davey8914He should']
Does he normally stutter so much??? / []
You can almost smell the guilt and shame, a disgusting depraved lunatic. / []
Well, well, well / []
British tax payers bailed out this unelected parasite / []
that went well😂 / []
This wasn’t a bad interview. He was pretty transparent. Now, the question I would have asked is if the Royal Family isn’t getting appropriate intelligence briefings from MI5/MI6 to keep them up to date about the people they are about to meet? I can’t imagine this going on with Epstein and no British intelligence has picked up on this to warn HM, the Prince or the government in a regular brief. / ['You answered your own question. This discrepancy validates that Prince Andrew met with Epstein in spite of the guy’s reputation and convictions; that any intel on Epstein was not enough to keep him from being the guy’s buddy. This demonstrates that the liaison stemmed not from incompetence but rather from conscionable malice.']
‘I’ve never been upstairs’… ‘…that was taken upstairs!’ / []
Btw he’s never faced any jail time for his crimes and he’s also never snitched on anything going on or anyone participating in it. And he’s probably the lest powerful person involved / []
Eaten alive and never felt a thing - at the time. / []
A foot massage by an underage Russian girl and his feet must have been pretty gross in its self. / []
Lying his balls off. / []
13:41 - his expression 😂 / []
ONCE UPON A TIME IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY......THE SEX PISTOLS UPSET THIS LOT OF FREELOADERS......THEN THE NATION PAID FOR IT. / []
“It’s been a mental health challenge for me for years” wow stfu / []
A cosmopolitan group / []
Liar liar pant on fire. Andrew is a repugnant clown, he belong in jail with Trump and  the rest of the sex abuser elite. / []
No consequences for the elites. What a surprise! / []
He’s actually a moron / []
Trump is trying to cover up all the crimes of Epstein. 1+1=2. / []
21:09 and the face right after! He doesn't believe his own words. This guy is lying his balls off!!! / []
When William is King 👑.  You and your ex red head will be lucky to get a shopping trolley and a blanket. 🙏😁 / []
What a bullshit artist, this degenerate should be in prison/ / []
This guy would try to talk his way out of a sunburn. / []
this is still so pathetic. . . / []
It literally takes him paragraphs to explain that photo. If it was fake, you'd just be straight up and say that it is a fact that you were not there that day, you were never there, and the photo is 100% fake. But he's carefully choosing every single word and rambling on and on and on... / ["It's a photograph of a photograph of a Kodak world too at the time.. if he can recall"]
Master class in terrible lying skills / []
It's incredible how Maitlis holds herself together for this length of time and through bomb after bomb that he drops. She only reacts once (near the end, "Conduct unbecoming?") and even that is restrained. Hard to imagine how she could have done a better job... or he a worse one.  I note some comments thaf this is the self-delusion that royals live in, but, actually, I have experienced other narcissistic people talking like this. They seem to have no shame about the ridiculousness of what they are saying because, apparently,  they truly believe that we are truly believing them. Unfortunately, the brazenness of how they speak, which confuses some about reality (gas lighting), and the agendas of others, which exploit the situation, often mean that they carry on without accountability. Indeed, this will be Andrew's personal history, leading him to believe he could always sail on without accountability. / []
A shameful mark on the British monarchy. Disgusting 🤑 / []
Prince Andrew you are a UK Prince I wish you the best on your interview be an English Gentleman . / []
His mom Queen Elizabeth II sure believed it to be true;  nothing got by The Queen. Prince Andrew was stripped of his rank. / []
He is disgusting / []
Horrible liar. This seems like a sitcom. / []
So if you’re friend with a serial killer and you get “benefits” outside your friendship like meeting people and “learning”, you shouldn’t regret it!! This is “too honorable “!!!!! / []
I do not remember rather than saying it didn’t happen!! I’ve gone thru it over and over and no it didn’t happen. So it’s a possibility otherwise why would you go over something over and over to make sure!!! Then she asked is the picture photoshopped? He says I can’t tell! Is the victim lying, he was asked and rather than saying a bold yes he says I can’t tell what her intention is!!!!! Well dummy if you didn’t do it then that’s called lying. You’re just too afraid to say that because you’re out of the court agreement doesn’t allow it! What a f…disgrace!!!! / []
49:27 / []
royal highness has some psycho tendencies, his chilling nervous laughs… grrr / []
such a disappointing human being / []
patheticly bad liar & entitled brat / []
His name would be chomo in prison, I mean should be. / []
He made the interviewer job EXTREMELY easy. Digging his hole deeper. / []
She  is like a surgeon ,so gentle ,precise and calm while silently carving the poor dude to the bone .And he is just sitting there not noticing the would see through him. / ['The world definitely knew who Emily Maitlis was, after this…', 'Why would he choose  to stay with epsteins house when at the sametime he says his place was like a train station. Dude, who would want to stay on a railway station.', "\u200b@Ashbash-kf5xdMaitlis is forensic in her examination. The quiet assassin of his entire persona and being. With each question he's being given a spade to dig his own grave.", 'He ain’t poor, literally or in this situation!', 'Yeah she really killed it. Great job!']
The Art of Coverup / []
I was really close to him, he wasn't really a friend. I was more of a friend of his girlfriend. But I felt that I had to see him face to face in order to break off our friendship. I told him that I didn't think it was good for us to be seen together. Not I don't want to be friends with you because I think that your sleeping with children is abhorrent. I don't regret knowing him because he was 'useful' to me. Have you slept with this woman? I have no recollection! Are you saying no to what she said, no that didn't happen, so she is lying? I don't know! / []
Lying piece of crap. / []
This guy is so guilty! / []
Perv Prince can’t recollect 😂 / []
Hilarious / []
I dont recall, I dont recall, I dont recall, well Ive never even bought a drink in Tramps nightclub, I don't buy drinks, I dont recall, I dont recall I distinctly remember going to Pizza express at 4pm on the 10th of March. / []
I couldn't possibly break up with a convicted Paedophile over the telephone I had to fly out to America to do it in person for several days, and to attend a small dinner of just 10 of us to celebrate his release. flawless as an illustration of privilege and delusion. "I was perhaps too honourable" - give me strength! / []
Don't blame Prince Andrew but the British Government. Andrew had a happy Glorious and brilliant career in the Royal Navy.But the British Government withdrew him for curious job of international  trade. / []
he blinks his eyes about three times when he's lying, and he absolutely was involved with Epstein and raping children / []
This is like any dude who gets busted by his girlfriend for cheating.  So many stories of bs. / []
Geez terrible liar. Why does the interviewer look like a Nutcracker? Lol / []
The way Andrew gasps between words... He's covering up, and minimizing his association with the "Party" via Jeffrey Epstein. Lies, shame, and only God knows the Truth. Prince Andrew has money to get his own hotel room in NYC. Why did he stay at Epstein's NYC house instead? They were dealing something... / []
I now wonder if he met andrew after he was investigated to warn him. Thats why he didnt use telephone / []
How are britbongs even still cucked by that family? :D i mean there are not too much sane poeple left / []
Anyone else feel that the word  “categorically” seems to be a favorite of liars? / []
So now his victim has committed suicide? Seems lots of people committing suicide.... / []
He actually believes his own guff! 😂😂 / []
Painful to watch / []
We wernt that close but i flew over the world to plead with him not to say what happened when they partied / []
Laughable 💀 / []
The end is near... watching from Europe / []
Trump is in the Epstein list!! Release the list NOW!!!!!! / []
Ask him about Katherine Keating / []
Prince Andrew said that his friendship with Epstein was not that close.  Then why would you feel like you need to travel around the globe to tell him that the friendship is over?   Would you not simply let it slide and move on, taking it as wow I dodged a bullet /red flag there.  Prince Andrew went to see Epstein to secure his silence. / []
EPSTEIN WAS A LEGEND HE PLANNED HIS GAME WELL VIDEO THEM WHILE BONKING KIDS GIRLS AND HE THREATENS THEM SO MANY PAID A LEG AND ARM  HENCE EPSTEIN WAS FUCKEN RICH / []
Poor Elizabeth 11. / []
Trumps a pedophile / ['is water wet?']
Liar liar pants on fire / []
An absolute train wreck / []
Andrew sniffs little girls bicycle seats. He was told not to. But as you well know he's a born sniffer. / []
Princess Anne is the only one fit to wear the crown. Just make her queen and be done with it. / []
Having watched this interview through twice, it is obvious to me that Emily Maitlis believed the girl & didn't believe Prince Andrew...going in, during & most certainly after the interview... / []
14:40 u would think someone of his pedigree, age & sleeze level would know how to lie alot better LOL !!! / []
Maitlis was fearless in her questioning & her calm but definitive manner...chilling watching & hearing the Prince prosecuted to hie demise... / []
The Royal Scandal was superb...actually created a bit of sympathy for 'Randy Andy' for me...Total tool but a sad & appropriate ending for him as an abuser of young women yeah? PAHT-Y! / []
He’s like the nodding dog Churchill in the advert🐶🇬🇧oh no…Oh YES🤷‍♀️😂😂😂 / []
If you don’t sweat, you haven’t done anything, everyone knows that / []
If he wasn't a close friend why would you need to break up in person?? / ['Hes just too darn honorable']
😂 he sounds like the real life Michael Scott (the office). "I have never really partied" 😂 / []
yes, just an average normal 'shooting weekend'....that one statement on its own ...completely displays how absolutely 'detached' he really is from reality and how the world of normal people live their lives....his arrogance and defiance knows no bounds ...he truly dug his own grave here / []
That guy looks soooo guilty / ['Perhaps it is the reason why you should not be called to the bar.', '\u200b@iansoutryer3189what do you mean... please, explain?']
"US eminents"... say the names / []
I am very upset to see what’s is happening seem So out of order . / []
I saw Prince Andrew in my Hotel he is Not a bad man he is was a gentleman well behaved I could not imaged he will do all those sorts that in the news paper said .I cannot understand why his body guards will let him do this things which is out of order . / []
Prince Andrew never a lone he have detective to make sure he was safe so all this information are not true He is an innocent Royal Son to the Queen .X / ['If Britian had any backbone he would be guillotined']
seems like the Royal Family always have scandal in every generation. / []
Damn brings back guilty memories! / []
CREEP / []
Liar just like Trump.  THEY ARE NASTY  GUILTY / []
Wasn’t this the same family that covered for Jimmy Savile too? / []
Yeah, sure pedophile, you did not know about anything... you just were part of everything. Disgusting piece of being. / []
I’m watching this again in 2025. This is truly the most damning interview I’ve ever seen. Watch any police interrogation and tell me this guy isn’t just straight up lying… He has never been held accountable or had to lie in his long privileged life. Just a completely amateur. Just look at Trump. Trump, while obviously a senile bumbling idiot and obviously guilty, lies waaaaay better than this sausage fingered idiot. / []
Thank you Ms Interviewer / []
Why are him and Prince Charles so horrible? / []
Creep / []
this is the greatest 50 minutes of non stop face plants I’ve ever seen / []
Omg prince andrew was caught out so many times on his interview what an embarrassment he was stuttering  nearly  all the way through he is guilty has sin he’s got away with this Scott free all because his mum was the queen how can he lie like that amazing 😂🤨👎😳 / []
Prince Andrew’s interview reveals a man so insulated by privilege he forgets which lie he’s telling. He denies knowing her, then describes her home. The “no sweating” line isn’t a defense — it’s a flex, a signal that truth is irrelevant when power protects you. This isn’t a misstep; it’s a glimpse behind the curtain. The monarchy didn’t falter here — it showed its face. / []
he is lying thru his teeth...there are photos of him with younger girls. / []
Wow if somebody accused me of these things if they were not true.  I would go after them.  He has no desire.  Why?  He's GUILTY and wants to brush it under the rug.  But he is an EXCELLENT LIAR / []
They're not underaged women, very young girls are CHILDREN. / ['Well, Virginia Giuffre was 17.', "\u200b@iansoutryer3189 Ain't like us.\nThat's a child. Can she vote on loosening restrictions on child rape? No. Because she's a child."]
Brave to take on the interview and letting us make our own minds. / []
Gawd what a tedious line of questioning this is lol... and let's not forget that the BBC protected Britain's most prolific P*do Jimmy Savile for years... 😐 / []
Filthy old prince pedophile / []
26:59 if he never went upstairs how would he know the photo was taken upstairs? / ['Saying he never went upstairs but in the pic he was upstairs LOL']
Another guest was Jon Brockman … https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?t=820 / []
I hate it when my tendency to be too honorable skews my judgement and I knowingly stay with convicted secs offenders. Such a bother this honor of mine....lol / []
44:42   His response to "we have to bring this to a close, we're running out of time" is the quintessential definition of a bumbling fool. I couldn't even translate it to captions if I wanted.  Just pure man fool! / []
Trump being in the Epstein Files and telling everyone to move on brought me here. / []
Somebody would of reconised him at pizza express he was never there liar / []
We need emily maitlis to interview every single person on the epstien list .  Prince andrew is the only one who has suffered .  Its not really fair that only he gets the blame . I bet he says the same . / []
His eyes hands etc says he did it man is lying so hard / []
Not a very good liar. / []
When she asked if he regrets their relationship he could've just said yes. That was an easy out. instead he was 'honest' then proceeded to lie further. Bizarre. / []
He just seems so unsure of himself und it is so obvious that he is lying. It must have have so devastating for Virginia to watch this. The interviewer is great though! Respectfully digging deeper and deeper,  not giving up. / []
What a mess of a man. He flew to NYC to plead for protection. / []
This interview makes me want to puke of dishonesty / []
This man is a perfect specimen for us to see when entitlement, money and power comes as a birth right and goes unchecked and unchallenged what vile and despicable character a human being can become. / ['The royal slug', 'Total bullshit hes a cock', 'That’s all royals', '\u200b@chrissantos5580They are owned by a powerful family', 'There is one in every generation of rf.   Looking back to george iii each generation had one like andrew.  Shldnt be a surprise anymore.  If i was govmt i wld be very careful doing business with anyone andrew found thru epstein!!   He nearly slipped up when he was asked about a party in 2010 and he started to give, i presume by his quickness, a rehearsed answer, only to stop suddrnly when he realised it wasnt the question or party he thought it was!! Hmm!']
Akkor már lehet tudni, hogy miért halt meg ez a lány is.....beszélt.... és akkor már lehet tudni, hogy miért halt meg Epstein is, mert zsarolt.......meghívott magához - kastély, sziget stb. - minden potenciális fizetőt, elcsábíttatta... megrendezte a bűnbeesését......  dokumentumokat készített, hogy zsarolja a pénzeseket...és először jót röhögött rajtuk.....ez egy üzletág, ahol halálosztással szokták meghálálni a zsaroltak....később már nem annyira szórakozott, mert félt....volt bőven akitől kellett..... / []
Watch the interview and look at his eyes. Almost everytime he denies he's blinking alot. That means alot (body language) / []
I'm shocked at how powerful these people are / []
https://youtu.be/OM0IBJbxwkk?si=remZZPtLTQRkzSxs / []
Hes SCARED,HIDING SOMETHING ,,HE ACTS CALM BUT RAGEFUL INSIDE 😂😂😂 / []
Just watched for first time. He’s not a good liar or very naive. His security officials have signed the official secrets act so unfortunately they couldn’t go public unless the courts can give them authority to do so.  But the truth will come out.   The royal family need to reveal the truth as I imagine if they don’t and if it comes out it could destroy the monarchy. / []
What 49:27 of lying looks like / []
Jimmy Saville also had close links to children's charities. It's called hiding in plain sight! There's no doubt in my mind that Andrew isn't telling the truth here. He knows what he did, but he believes he's untouchable due to the protection of The Royal Family. Even The King sees him as a problem. I can't wait until William takes the throne. We'll see some blue blood run freely then.  The man is an entitled and offensively arrogant pos. I despise everything about him, and that opinion will never change. It sounds like I'm anti-royal, but I'm really not. I like all the other members of the family. I'm just anti-Andrew. Pos n**ce! / []
"The decision was coloured by my tendency to be too honorable" LOLOLOLOLOL / []
Now that she passed away. / []
People they say he's such a liar they say you you can even say the way he's acting when he's talking talking / []
Your a disgrace to the royal family you bought shame upon your parents / []
A thick skinned Creep / []
So she just made it all up and you paid her out for her wild imagination along with all the other victims of creeps like you !!! / []
Then why did you pay her out liar?!! / []
You don’t recall sweating all over the teenager ? What a liar !!! / []
Then how do you know it was upstairs / []
Such a bad liar obviously one of trumps mates !! / []
Everybody like and share to bring more amd more focus on the pedos in the EPSTEIN EPSTEIN EPSTEIN FILES!!!! / []
Who the hell goes to eat dinner next to a convicted child molester whom you KNEW was such? Five years later and this still smacks  as being SA partner in crime. The walk was to negtiate payment plan after Epstein bribed your nasty arse / ['He didn\'t expect the interviewer to know that he went to dinner with Epstein, which is why he was so confident in saying he flew across the globe to say "we can\'t be friends anymore"....meanwhile he partied with him and stayed with him at his house that entire week LOL']
We a fool / []
Hey y’all watching this from 2025! ❤ / []
Hello from 2025! Still watching this!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ 1:17 / []
Watching this in 2025 and it’s hilarious! ❤❤❤ 1:00 / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCgj2UdTGqI this is a man that was surrounded and supported child abusers , not my king. Charles is much worst than Andrew / []
21:49 He says “oh, was she..” and then stops himself / []
Not even 5 mins in, he sounds and looks guilty. Epstein is not a “close friend” but sees him at least 3 times a year living in different continents. Also just happens to stay over in his houses and gets invited to his parties as the guest of honor. / []
actually it's good that the western journalists probe into issues like these / []
The lady is great / []
So he stopped talking to him in 2006, then 4 years later in 2010 directly after getting out of jail he needed to tell him AGAIN, in person that he cant be seen with him, while being seen with him?...... make it make sense. / []
He says it’s a positive action for a man to have sex as an excuse to justify not engaging in sex with a minor, instead of saying “ I would never ever have any sort of sexual encounter with an underage girl”. This man is disgusting / []
"A convenient place to stay"??? / []
ROFLMAO! / []
We understand, pimps bring people together, been doing that a long time dude     3:34 / []
He can’t remember the best sex he’s ever had ? That’s a positive in his life and felt like a man.  He had fun. / []
He can’t even lie well.  Just stay away, per your counsel.  Maxwell (the madam) was more important and his personal friend. / []
He couldn’t stay away.  He’s stuttering too much.  He’s visiting a friend  and he’s handing business when he could of did this at home. / []
He partied with Epstein and Maxwell. He had fun.  He shouldn’t have to address it. / []
So what was the lawsuit settlement with the woman or women?  He didn’t party but he’s so friendly to have pictures of him with his arm around a young lady when he’s so happily married / []
Lie detector test / []
Bro you are super rich, nobody is buying that you stayed with him out of convenience 😮 / []
..emberassing even to watch.... / []
Who is here in 2025? / []
Wat a load of bullshit coming from him 🤣🤣 / []
Great Journalist! ❤ / []
His security and staff dont recall anything either lmao / []
How can he not recall ANY of this? I think if you showed him video evidence of himself he would not recall it lol / []
Scum bag / []
The doors are going to be bloody blown off when the files are released !..  Randy's shitting bricks / []
He’a a horrible liar and incredibly guilty. She’s a good interviewer / []
What?! This guy thinks we're FKN IDIOTS! ROFLMFAO! HAHAHAHAHA! 😇✝ / []
Who's here after trump 😂 / []
The Freudian slip at 10:21 is brutal / ['Yeah, it implies that he was a part of it, nice catch.', 'Dude.', 'Good catch', 'I was asking about Freudian slip but I got it. It was a "oops" in his speech, when he let transparing he was envolved with all this crap.', 'honestly LMFAO, been waiting for someone to point this out']
Great job by the interviewer!   I think he actually believes he’s acing the interview. What a fool!  His smugness is beyond belief! / []
And I thought I was a bad liar…..😂 I can’t believe his staff or anybody close to him allowed him to put his foot in his mouth and didn’t protect him. And he can’t sweat because of something that happened in the Falkland Islands? I don’t think it’s even possible to sweat in that type of climate. Everybody was freezing during that war. And Great Britain has been accused of a lot of things, but having a tropical climate that will make u sweat, is not one of them. Florida and the Virgin Islands, however, will make ur balls sweat as soon as you set foot outside the house. 😂 / []
Nothing worse than a moron who thinks he’s smarter than the rest of us. / ['Dunning-Kruger effect', '"My tendency to be too honourable" Oh SHUT UP who says that']
what is he doing now days? / []
Another member of the elite super rich living in the shadows beyond the reach of the law, no extradition no arrest.. too prominent to be disappeared too much evidence to be ignored, Epstein and the victim.?.. not so much.! But then is he really dead or living the dream in the Middle East.??? / []
The man is very obviously innocent / []
Why would he agree to do this lmfao / []
Mofo was learning business alright how to be with pedophiles and getting away with it also he definitely banged Maxwell in college smh / []
2:20 “I’ve never really partied” / []
This interview is interview gold. / []
31:47 “sex is a positive act” lmao / []
The most guilty man I have ever seen / []
28:55 “no activity - heheheh” / []
Do Trump next / []
This week he had a 'straightforward golfing weekend' / []
Royal liar! Cant stand this Pos! / []
"He was in and out and all over the place" 😅😅😅😅 / []
Hahahaha so happy this came back on my feed. You disgusting little man. / []
Such a pompous arse / []
He’s at a man house for few days and say he wasn’t there long enough 😂😂😂😂 / []
Reallly now you never went in the house but you remember how in the same house look 😂😂😂 bro you should’ve stay away from the interview / []
Eerie… I couldn’t continue listening… and this was the third time I tried to. / []
It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if there were photos out there of this guy and Trump spit roasting some poor girl. / []
BBC was kind of enough to give this man to think and lie properly, he still failed 😅 / []
What a brilliant interviewer! And bros constantly lying 😂 / []
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 / []
R Kelly’s somewhere screaming “Bro, this is NOT the way to handle an interview!” / []
This definitely didn’t age well 🥴 He lied about everything ‼️ His face Says It Alll / []
PUNK ROCK HAPPENED..........THERE ARE NO JEDI KNIGHTS.............. / []
TOTAL LIAR. / []
so Andrew perceives himself as "extraordinary?"  Last I checked, he was white trash in the royal family.  He is completely lying in the interview.  He never knew Epstein "liked 'em young?"  He is so full of bull crap!   He never wondered who all those girls were?   Please, arrest him and throw him in a sad jail.. / []
Go to Settings and set playback speed to 1.25. / []
He went to see him to tell him he couldn't be seen together... LOLOL / ['Then they went for a public walk and later had dinner to celebrate his release.']
After all this time..... this interview makes me cringe. I hope the press never gives up trying to bring this arrogant prick to justice. / []
Prince Squirmdrew.... what a pompous pillock. Lock him up and protect the world from smarmy lying creeps like him. / []
Staying with a sex offender of children is the "Honorable thing to do!??" Good Hell!! / []
Pompous upper-crust twit with a superiority complex.  Tea-drinking overlord of nonsense.  An out-of-touch British elitist with questionable intellect  A posh nincompoop with a PhD in condescension. / ['Looool']
They thought that the plebs had no intelligence. Tired of awful people in high places and high on themselves / []
Who is his publicist? Bc they need to be fired lmao / []
Out of court payment to his underage sex girl. / []
He NEVER admits.  He never was convicted of anything…nothing.  Think what you will, he admitted nothing. / []
Notice he says “happily married” in the beginning but never once says “I would never have sex with anyone outside my marriage” or “it’s not possible for me to have sex with anyone outside of those girls because I’m faithful” . He only denies recollection of having sex with Virginia. Hahahaha Can’t imagine what his wife and family are thinking watching this. / []
27:59 oh he remembers the memories / []
Comedy from beginning to end / []
2025 and still 🤮 / []
Prince Andrew   ” there is a big problem with this interview because I’m not prince Andrew , I’m his double , the real one is on lolita express right now heading to Epsteins island getting a massage from a 12 year old girl so he sent me instead . ”. / []
The easiest tell to watch for if he is lying or not is to watch how fast he answer's. immediately if it's truth ( no hasitation, no pause, no stupid faces) now watch it and keep that in mind and then let look at @13:40 / []
Ohhh gurl… / []
"Raundy Andy" / []
He forgot to adjust his tie. / []
Liar Andrew Scandal ! / []
I was doing a number of other things while I was there! Like breathing… blinking…. The usual. / []
Nope, nothing suspicious to see here! Doesn’t everyone have life-size chess boards of their staff in sexy clothes as pieces? Doesn’t everyone have a painting of Bill Clinton in a dress and heels? And a mob of high school girls running around? / []
Where’s the rest? Isn’t it supposed to be 57 minutes? / []
The most guilty body language ever! / []
I find it very odd he finally did this interview a few months after Epstein death. Hmmm! / []
If only Andrew has an Uber account he wouldnt have had these problems. / []
Extraordinary people ...  .criminals and sociopaths you mean. / []
The whole Brito-American ruling class is filth. / []
GUILTY ASF BUT LIKE THE REST OF THE PEDOS AND PREDATORS HE'S SAFE 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 ESPECIALLY UNDER TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
a good example of double standards / []
So how do you know it was upstairs if you were never upstairs, you can't know what upstairs looks like omg !!!! / []
The hardest 49 minutes of his life / []
It's strange how many suicides this has caused ay / []
Even his teddy bears are disgusted with him. Free the teddy bears!!! / []
I smell royal cover up / []
Idiot doesn’t quite capture this entitled gene(ius)… / []
I came here after watching a Royal Scandal. So let me get this right he ceases contact with Epstein when he’s arrested but as soon as he’s out he has to go tell him they can longer be friends face to face even though they aren’t that close?? Huh?……. Did he even think this through,  it’s a complete dumpster fire! She provided the rope, he did the rest / []
10:54 that’s brilliant. You were advised huh? So the palace and the queen were involved  No no no no no 😂 It’s such a great way to pull apart that lie / []
I just wish we could have heard more about pitch@palace. / []
The interviewer being clearly disgusted by this man is just the cherry on top of the gourmet sundae that is this interview. / []
It's interesting to watch this from the angle of LYING in say, Andrew vs Trump. Andrew is massively uncomfortable, hence a horrible liar. Trump lies his fat ass off every time he opens his mouth, but lying is so integral to his being that it comes off smoothly, casually, glibly - he's so perfectly comfortable with lying that his presentation says yeah, you know I'm lying my ass off, but it's so second nature and effortless to me that you'll start to believe I'm telling the truth. / ['Yeah, you wish! 😂', '\u200b@scarlettwinters5642you support child abusers lol']
I remembered the uproar after this interview! He was stripped off of his titles by the Queen ! / []
What a dirty co..su..er / []
SO full of CRAP / []
SUCH AN A hole !! I feel badly for his daughters ! / []
Instead of saying, I don’t remember, wouldn’t you say I would never ever engage in anything so hideously immoral? Instead of saying that Epstein did something untoward, where is the outrage at the hideous things that Epstein did? It’s obvious that it’s not really a big deal to him. / []
This was so insightful. It made it so clear to this American that the Royals live on a whole other freaking planet.  They have no understanding of reality and that is why he would say these outrageously stupid things that he said thinking anyone could possibly believe him, thinking he could have any credibility whatsoever. / []
Who is here because of the movie scoop / []
This story is very weird to me, more than 100 victims and no client sentenced even Jeffrey Epstein had recorded many clients. / []
2025 and the water is boiling / []
Interviewer was great. And I love how low key  the approach was “let’s see how you present”. And from second one his tie was crooked and no one, not even his handlers brought attention to it. 👍    In other thoughts: Guilty! / []
Everyones lying except me mummy / []
All them little giggles he does when talking about all of these morbid things. Royally disgusting. / []
Excellent interview!! That so sad that the prince did not pay being arrested as a pedophile !! ☹️ / []
Andrew has a bad memory😂 / []
Yikes / []
motel 8 would have left the light on.... / []
2010 WTF 🤬 / []
No more lies.  Mark 8:36. / []
24:35 i dont remember going upstairs in the house , the photgraph was taken upstairs , / ['How would he know the photo was upstairs if he claims he doesent remember going upstairs in the house']
13:38 his laugh turns so quick into panic and fear / ['rEAllY????\n5 seconds later: I DON’T KNOW MR. BROCKMAN!!!']
She needs to ask more questions. He is so guilty / ['I remembered the day after this interview! There was an uproar in Britain. The Queen stripped his titles and I believe she had to pay compensation on his behalf to settle the lawsuits! He’s disgraced !']
The arrogance of Andrew is amazing.  It is easy to see he is a narcissist and will lie at the snap of a finger. / []
Beast / []
The shame you brought on your mother probally led to her demise / []
The best thing about this interview is like the journalist speaking so softly like not to scare himself off but rather allowing sex offender friend to publicly destroy his life and image in 49 minutes. / []
Not once did he give his condolences to the victims...speaks volumes. / ['Bingo', "One rarely ever is sympathetic with one's accuser. \nRegardless of false or true accusations, having that said, it does not speak nothing at all.", '\u200b@MrHarry5001😂if your not guilty you can still show remorse of victims she wasnt the only 1 to come forward. She just had the balls to e pose him because she was trafficked to him directly']
He might have not remembered being there. Here’s my theory. Epstein often gave his friends benzodiazepines, opioids, and stimulants before these events. Without a tolerance if you the doses Epstein was taking you would completely black out. You would not have any impulse control and really any idea what was going on. That’s how Epstein likely got these politicians and friends relaxed, calm, and indifferent to these abhorrent things. / []
10:17 " He didn't go into great depth about what I was doing, ehm I mean what HE was doing"...okay. / []
8:26 tongue protrusion - displeasure? annoyance? Oh shit? / []
Genocide apologists and enablers. The BBC is a disgrace / []
22:24 - that's how they show actors acting in Hollywood movies when they lie / []
Whos here trying to find connections in the Epstein conspiracy? / []
He went to New York to tell him in person in public that he can't be seen in public with him. That's just the stupidest. You would expect more from royal lawyers and p.r. team. Literally no one would ever believe that story.   Like not even trying. He coulda said epstein was blackmailing him or something. Or epstein said his mom had cancer and he was being a good friend. Or you thought he got railroaded, you didn't believe the charges, or you wanted to find out for yourself.   I mean anything but this story. Just an epic fail on p.r.   I'm glad he got exposed. / []
Disaster. Not believable in any way at all. Terrible mistake to do this interview.   I have never seen such a more disgusting interview. The slippery lies. While talking about trafficking. Very disturbing. / ['What do you mean? His only mistake was his tendency to be "too honorable".']
My god this guy's a freaking tool 😂😂😂😂 / []
And he is still freeeeee :) / []
I don't even remember what I did on my birthday 20 years ago (and I know the date of my birthday) - and somehow he's able to conjure up a pizza party on a randomly specific date? / []
Wasn't close at all to Epstein but decided to make the trek to his house to break off the relationship? / []
Anyone come back to this just to laugh at his smugness and complete lack of awareness? / []
This interview is so damning / []
Guilty… / []
Terrible interview ... / []
The whole British royal family probably had a facepalm reaction to this interview! / []
He is the worst liar on this planet😂  How the f... was this guy the favorite child of the queen??? He is an arrogant proud weak idiot 🤮🤮🤮 and every woman can imagine that he is for sure a total pervert. I can🤮👈 / []
Love the way this came back to me after not seeing it for a minute😭the world needs to own / []
Someone need to edit this bs into a sitcom laugh track every time that clown finishes a sentence lmaoooo plssss / []
The list of those who were in Epstein’s orbit is a who’s who of the rich and powerful. They belong to the same club, they socialize with the same kind, the eat at the same restaurants, they shop at the same malls. This dude here is a living example of how wealth and power lays bare the depravity of our exhibitionist ruling class accountable to no one. It’s the toddy record of our oligarchic masters, those who lack the capacity for shame or guilt, whether dressed up as Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton or Donald Trump. / []
With all the Epstein still going on, I just watched this last evening first time, wow I have to say I was like oh it’s over for this man Prince Andrew .  And look where we are now ,crazy. / []
This guy should win an Oscar / []
Here in July, 2025. This is the most guilty interview I’ve ever seen. / []
apparently he wasn't close with him but met with epstein and stayed in his house awful amount of times?? hmmmm / ['Because he was too honorable to not fly across the globe and tell a man he wasnt close with that they  cant be friends anymore.']
Why is he not in jail / []
Geez, He screwed this up? And now he's allowed back to the US?? I wonder why Trump allowed this? / []
Ok now rewatch it and pretend it’s Alan Partridge 💀 / []
How can anybody doubt this honourable man..🤔 / []
Is he a bit mad / []
So Andrew makes no contact to Epstein for four years, then goes to see him only to tell him that he wants to cease contact? He then says he left the next day, but then a few minutes later he admits to staying at Epsteins house for a few days afterwards because it was “convenient” AND had dinner with him as a “guest of honour”??? Plus he’s never been upstairs in maxwells house but can still identify it in the photo! / []
This is a very interesting interview. / []
His explanation for the photo is what his legal strategy would be,  behind closed doors. / []
This man is full of shit. / []
The elite who get away with everything. 😢 Sick. / []
There's i good chance that I'm wrong but there's no such thing as a coincidence. Virginia Giuffre was a reminder of a mistake that had to be taken care of. / []
I’ve come back to this video every year since it’s dropped and I always seem to learn something new about how dumb this man is / []
Its such a disgrace to humanity that this man is walking free. What a scumbag. / []
I'm here after Virginia's farewell video.  I believed you the whole time Virginia and may God have mercy on your soul 🙏🏽 / ['What farewell video??', '\u200b\u200b@bandits9652a video that she recorded prior to her murd3r telling all', '\u200b@bandits9652 a video that she pre-recorded prior to her Murd3r', 'We should all know by now that Barack Obama, and Bill Gates are guilty as charged. Per Virginia.', '\u200b@bandits9652 if you know u know']
I thought people were very harsh with Andrew after this. Since the end of the Falklands War, he’s suffered from a debilitating condition that prevents him from telling the truth. / []
I didn't sweat at the time😂😂😂 / []
He thinks other people are retarded. He is pure scum / []
12:11 "It was a convenient place to stay" You mean a wealthy prince couldn't afford a hotel? 🤨 / []
less than 2 minutes in this fool says it's a stretch that he and Epstein were close friends and "quite often if I was in the United States and doing things and he wasn't there he'd say 'why don't you come and use my houses.'"   Yeah, I'd let any rando I casually know use my house when I'm not there. Totally relatable. / ["Don't forget after getting caught being a child diddler, Andy couldn't be a chicken, he had to be a MAN and fly across the globe to tell Epstein they can't be friends anymore....before staying in his house for that entire week and going to a dinner party.\n\nBut it's a considerable stretch to claim they were good friends.... Lol"]
How many other British royals are this low IQ? Arrested development  on steroids. 🤯 / []
Their whole argument falls apart when he said he didn't sweat that year 21:26 / []
His face says "how'd you find that out" 13:40 / []
Even clowns  are lefing at this creature  of the chair hade wire's he will be electric cuted for lying to much  he is a  pure nircsiosist  liyer / []
HIS REPUTATION AND LEGACY IS COMPLETLY DESTROYED. / []
Princess Andrew  things and talk like republicans all bu**** c liyers excuses I don't now I don't not now what you talking about I don't remember  I never meet this  girl's  corrupt  corrupt corrupt / []
Brother, at least pretend you came prepared. / []
virginia, i believe you, and i have believed you from the very start. you gave the world a gift by speaking up and advocating for all those who live in fear of speaking up. i wish i could have had the opportunity to have told you this in person and given you a hug. i wish you could still be here to see the people who harmed you face the public and fall flat on their face doing it. you deserved so much better. i hope you are at peace now and able to finally rest after the tireless work you have done for others. / []
Interviewer hot af / []
I watch this when im having a bad day..... / ['😂😂😂😂', '🍀']
“I flew to his house and we went out for a walk in a public park to tell him we can’t be seen out in public together” / []
Don't sweat Andy, we didn't believe a word you said 🤭 / []
all his responses are uncomfortable..and I dont remember / []
Too many "absolutely". Andrew is a really dangerous man. A full liar. His name is in the Epstein Files. Don't protect the 'philes, show the files / []
Rich and filthy! THERE IS NOTHING REGAL ABOUT THIS FELLA. / []
This man is one of the worst liars in history and is definitely one if epsteins closest and most sawn guest wow / []
the brittish royal fam his ordered many hits on people like lady Diana, also Jeffrey to save their own reputation towards the public / []
"He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together" extraordinary, in what sense? 😂 / []
*rolls eyes "it was a convenient place to stay" ... prince at a sex offenders house lol. / []
This guy is a liar, disgusting, inhumane and a joke. I believe Miss Virginia G. totally and there is evidence that she told the truth. Beautiful Virginia, test in peace. / []
Is this individual in jail already? So many proved material that accuses him as a predator of young girls. There are pictures , his confusing interview, records of his friendship with the pedophile. How you even meet someone and became friends with a guy who hardly finished high school being you a royal person. Hope he is already in jail and forever. / ['At best He slept with a 17 year old. So what is the reason for putting  him in jail?']
A Guilty Conscience needs no Accusing. / []
The sheer convenience of staying with a convicted sex offender just outweighed any other thoughts at that time and the meeting to say"Goodbye" lasted 4 days with Dinner parties thrown in. Anytime I was in Tramps nightclub I never bought a drink, in fact I don't even know where the bar is in Tramps. Yes, I specifically remember the 10th of March that year, I was in Pizza Express in Woking. No, I have a peculiar medical condition in that I didn't sweat at that time. Yes, that's me in the picture with Virginia Roberts but we can't be certain that's my hand. . . (!) / []
It is reasonable to assume that this scenario was orchestrated by Musad in order to control politicians and influential people for special decisions. Current events, particularly in the Middle East, with the unconditional solidarity of Tramp and co, do not allow any further conclusions. This has so far been elegantly attributed to the Russians. / []
Royal 😂  typical English. Rape, steal and murder / []
"I tell you straight forward: I am not here."  *stares intensely* / []
Why do they sit for interviews when they know they will be putting their foot in their mouths / ['They think ppl will believe them']
Andrew says if I was in place of If I were. That's a little strange. / []
Well Andrew, if you'd never been upstairs in Guillaines house, how could you identify the background? / []
The woman needs a knighthood. Great presence. / []
What I've learned about Andrew so far:  - he doesnt sweat - he doesnt show affection in public (so he couldn't have had his arms around Virginia) - he havent been upstairs (but apparently knows how upstairs looks like??) - he has never seen Epstein with a camera - he has no recollection of anything whatsoever (he is showing signs of early alzheimers??)  allriiighty then! / []
To put it nicely: What a pile of horseshit. 💩💩 / []
Release the Epstein files❗️❗️Expose those monsters❗️❗️ / []
“It was a convenient place to stay” because I saved hundreds of dollars on hotels plus those young teens were very tempting and addictive. In conclusion, the Saudi royalty marries 9 year old girls, the elite have their way with young teens, specially if they don’t have stable families, so the question is: why not either put all the political elite in prison or release all the pedophiles who are in prisons all over the U.S.? Or just like weed, prostitution, and many other things make child love legal and tell the poor, overworked parents who paid for your trip to Epstein with their taxes to worry yet about 1 more thing. As if they are already not worry about it? / []
That pizza story, him staying at Epstein's place as an honorable gesture. I wonder what his immediate family thinks of him. All of these elites thoughts they could just get away with Monstrous and vile acts they did to those innocent minors. I hope each and everyon of those vile individuals are held accountable and pay for their sins. / []
Guys got more money than god and he’s acting like he needs to crash at someone’s house. His biggest weakness is he’s so honorable lol. I had to go break up w him in person 😂 / []
I flew to his house to see him with the plan to tell him I couldn't be seen with him, and then when it was time to tell him we went out into the park to be seen together in public to tell him we couldn't be seen together. / ['And then we went out to a dinner party that night and I stayed in his house for the rest of the week because "it was a convenient place to stay"']
He's so arrogant 😒 very Old Skool monarchist who thinks Serfs will believe anything he says, purely because he is a fancy Royal😢 / []
Absolute rubbish! Liar! / []
lmfao he looks and sounds so guilty 😅 / []
He is a LIAR / []
6:31 wow / []
This is all a load of twaddle there are  Pakistani rape gangs running free in Britain, and people are more upset about this. / ["So you only care about r*pe when they aren't white ? So it's not about the R*pe for you then is it ? Just say you are a racist.", '@Davedavid: you are quite right. However the victims in e.g\n Rotherham are just nameless white victims and the perpetrators are countless Asians. And of course it\' s dangerous to put a finger on it\nAs you can see here: the only argument "Brett Pilkington" is mustering, is that of racism, hoping to silence you.']
Either he is a big liar or his memory was wiped / []
They are now investigating if Giuffre’ was killed or actually committed suicide in Australië.🇦🇺 / []
Love this guy! / []
Virginia was just one victim that we heard and jnow of but GOD only knows the other imported children. that was used and abused from all over the world / []
Sheme of you prince Andrew!!!!! / []
You had it all. And you decided to throw it all away because of greed and lust.   Time for a Trump interview! / []
I appreciate her not butting in the whole time, letting him speak. Just letting himself trip himself up / []
The more he talks, the better. / []
“The party prince” means he’s been to the island / []
How is it possible he got away with rape and trafficking / ['Be white and rich.  You can even still become President']
Rest in peace Virginia / []
ohh it's SO CONVINIENT to stay at this house with tons of trafficked underage girls coming and going all the time. LOL / ['Still cracks me up, this freak is so far removed from reality--imagine thinking this, much less saying it in front of a camera crew', 'It was unbecoming']
I think he did pretty good in this interview. He........... didn't even break a sweat / []
Ok pedohfile / []
Hard to watch / []
Very convenient loss of memory. / []
Obviously had some of trumps bs training 😮 / []
Disgusting guy. Look at how he winks all the time. This happens when you are lying. / []
Sums up the English monarchy to perfection. A bunch of scums and low lives. / []
And he still walks free. The rich and powerful literally grape our kids and we still let them do whatever they want in the name of - law and order. Amazing. / []
Fix your necktie crocket prince. / []
For being so smart and powerful these pedophiles are stupid af / ['Lol facts', 'Pedophile? At best he slept with a 17year old.']
JE proved super rich and powerful are as evil as himself / []
Horrible at lying / ["mans brought a doctors note for why he couldn't sweat", '@mistertaylor92Wrong, he was asked by VG’s lawyers to provide proof. He never did and wound up paying her 12 million.']
Who advised this man? 😂😂😂 / ["I think his advisers literally quit once they found out he's doing this interview lol. \n\nSo he advised himself."]
What a scumbag! Royal family fanatics, keep kissing their hands;) / []
I know my fellow brudren in the UK need there reparations jus like us in the US ✊🏿 / []
Did everyone just forgot about this? / []
The foto is not fake Andrew / []
He is got his balls in his throat😂😂😂 / []
Feel sorry for the guy   .. The way he is struggling.. It's sad.. And shameful for the royalty.. So sad / []
They should repeat all this on the television.   Lol / []
Can't you see?? / []
He’s disgusting and paid Virginia Duphrey over 16 million US dollars to settle the case. Andy is an awful person and liar. I’m glad he got stripped of his royal title. He’s a pig. I remember when a girl was leaving Epstein apt in nyc and who was closing the door looking out. !!!! ANDREW!!!! He left the next day after he had another night filled with sex with minors. These people must think everyone is stupid. You can tell this interview was total BS. / []
This guy is a terrible liar. / []
King dong 👑🤴👲🇬🇧2025 / []
News night has mega balls to do this. / ['balls are the weakest thing on earth']
He's lying smdh / []
It’s hard to believe that the Duke of York can do anything or be anywhere without his security detail being within 15 feet of him.  If Andrew went to a pizza place, it would have been noted in the security logs, making it pretty convincing evidence.  But nope. / []
What kind of BS is it that he was shot at and now can’t sweat!??? 😂😂😂😂 what!?! And overdose of adrenaline caused him not to be able to sweat. Only at that time! Not now though. Now he can sweat his arse off. Lawd / []
Could he take a lie detector test? even now to prove his innocence? / []
God knows everyones dirt Andrew, no one can manipulate God 😂🎉it keeps us all on a level playing field 😅 judge not or you will be judged. You cannot get blood from turnips 😂🎉 / []
100% guilty / ['And so is Trump']
He thinks that he’s such a good liar 😂😂😂 / []
This dude was a regular goer / []
He over explained so many of his answers and even some of it totally unnecessary. He knew was guilty / []
It's crazy to watch a 49 minute long car crash and not see a single car! / ['😂😂 Ikr? He has never taken accountability for anything in his entire life. He literally said he still wouldn’t regret his friendship with a convicted PDFile on camera. A child could lie wayy better that him lol.', 'Well maybe if you pulled it out of your ass, we can get the plates and vin #!', 'I see a train wreck really without a train anywhere.', 'Well said 👏', 'Car crash? Two boeing 747 hitting each other in midair more likely.']
This is what id describe as both, shameless, and a masterpiece. Highly recommended - award winning - 9 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / []
Where is ? / []
12:33 beautiful / []
The relieved 'yeah yeah yeah' when she starts talking about moving on / []
Look what is going on in the USA currently. Think worst is still on its way for you Randy Andy.😂😂😂😂 / []
MORON / []
So after the first trial, they still kept going back to that man’s Island you tell me what the truth is please / []
This is a snot nosed useless brat that is a leech on the people of Britain. Do away with this useless family / ['Absolutely']
What a liar. God sees it all, you cannot lie to Him. You’re going to pay a high price if you don’t humble yourself. As a husband and father you are responsible and must give account, as an adult man who is responsible to cover and protect, not uncover and exploit people especially children in any way. Get your heart right, you are a sinner who needs mercy. Cry out for it! / []
All these men that participated are the types that never could get a beautiful woman for free...by personality or genuiness..but all had to pay. Lol They ALL have that in common.  Paying for them is like not having them, still. Maybe try being honest, passionate, not lying fools!? / []
when jesus comes back these demons will be forced to confront their wicked ways and be judged before God, they should be very afraid. / []
"There was no indication, absolutely NONE when I was staying at his houses"  Dude...the NAKED WOMEN PAINTINGS AND PORTRAITS!? THE MASSAGES he GOT DAILY, MANY TIMES!?   LIAR from SATAN. ALL OF YAS!! / []
Makes me SICK how deviant, guilty, permiscuous types can try to present themselves as such well-mannered, I AM giving you this talk to clear my good name, kind and unassuming types. Hell, I work for them everyday at a local buisness. All fake, all hidden, all evil. Liars they all are. The truth is not in them! / []
It's rumored that Andrew and Fergie and Victoria hervey were having a threesom / []
He needs to get taken down asap / []
What a disaster of a person. Scum. / []
Now things are more clear why many politicians and important figures unconditionally had to support Israel because AIPAC blackmails… / []
Notice how when he went to go tell epstein he shouldn’t be seen with him while getting seen with him that he never describes it as “You are a pedophile you make me sick I never want to see you again, it is instead “because of all this heat on you I cannot speak to you anymore”  Then proceeded to go back on that ANYWAY   you can’t make this shit up, yet this guy still roams free. I’d say its unbelievable, but its unfortunately too believable in the world we live in. / []
Your nose is growing 🤦 / []
Если бы не фильм Сенсация я бы никогда не узнала про это интервью / []
Don’t be too hard on Andrew, he’s had enough of that serving the Navy at her majesty’s pleasure / []
All his life he seen himself as untouchable,  and he belives he can get away with anything.  I see 2yo kids telling lies better then this fu ing rapist. / []
This interview is even more convincing than the pic / []
Trump has done worse / ['That’s why him and many off them serving for Israel unconditionally…']
How was prince Andrew to know that Jeffery Epstein wasto become a convicted sex offender? Anyway / ['He knew all along, he was participating. Hence the reason he paid off VG. He knew 100 percent when he was convicted and jailed the first time and still associated with him.']
No fear for a dad like prince andrew / []
This guy should have brought a lawyer / []
There is two sides to every story / ['There is not two sides to every story but there are two sides to every story.', 'There is only one Truth though and he doesn’t have it in him.']
Photos have no dates on them in the eighties / []
Prince Andrew remembers Beatrice's birthdays and he's Navy he's honest he's innocent / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡']
Fourty years ago / []
Please someone in his corner throw in the towel ! / []
This guy isn't into females / []
I cant believe this guy is not in jail / []
Wth / []
I went to go and see him to tell him we can no longer be together 😅 Bro, this can be done over the phone 😂 / []

Arrested them all release the list / []
He proves one thing, over and over again. Bad decision making / []
that...that...that... / []
sorry at 49.26 he says "If you're a man  it is a positive act to have sex with somebody. You have to take some sort of positive action..." if you try to forget it's very difficult to try and forget positive action"  What the flying fck is he rambling on about?!! I'm partly screaming in laughter and shock that he could speak those words. Positive action MY ARSE! / []
URGHHH the hubris of the man..and HE IS LYING / []
Sexy prince Andrew... / []
Damn this interviewer was a total badass. She crushed it. She accomplished exactly what she needed. / []
He is the worst liar...omggg / []
What a douche. / []
No one is posting anything useful anymore / []
I'm calling it.. More Guilty than OJ. / []
A liar caught live on TV. / []
I watched this rubbish many times and it is still sickening, i don't understand why he has not been arrested, WHT. / []
Indict this creepy devil... / []
Aye!! Very good andy you brought your shady outfit to epsteins home to try an protect your status an reputation but at the end of the day the camera never lies!!! / []
God help his girls an fergie what an animal full of cocaine like the royals history full of coke what a brain fried moron he messed up big time he has to live for his lies for the rest of his life cos lilly bett is not here to protect him anymore an charles is still accomidating him so bluddy sad!!! / []
Absolutely loved his popeye eyes when my we pal asked him if he met Virginia in tramp nightclub his eyes were ready to pop out his sockets now i know why everyone in the palace called him randy andy the playboy all theu beautiful women he had including fergie an he was into tennage girls an underage as well what a liar!! Absolute freak total PO / []
I met edward and sophie when i was 32 years old in Airdrie in north Lanarkshire in Scotland an they were both opening up a citizens advise bureau in Airdrie then an he was absolutely lovely that was 23 years ago he is such a lovely man an Sophie is an amazing woman its no wonder they keep out of the public eye i do not blame them!! / []
I watched this interview with this amazing woman broadcast live he was lying through his Windsor teeth an this still won't change his shady outfit done away with Epstein an they done the same with Virginia dufrey princess Diana was enough!!! anyone that speaks out against any of the Windsor's and are brave enough like these girls to take them on very misteoursly die not just Diana an Virginia multiple amounts of brave people through the decades I used to respect Andrew growing up as a child and I think now the Windsor's are just another disgusting class of debauchery throughout the whole monarchy the queen an princess Ann swept a hell of a lot under the carpet an their shady outfit helped them for years it's a very true saying if your rich pay your scandals away!! Absolutely true how the other half live!!! / []
Bumping the algorithm / []
This vile pos and trump need to be thrown in prison for what they did with their friends / []
This guy is a fraud. So is the entire structure of the so called "royals".  When will the UK wake up and jettison these clowns? they don't belong in the 21st century. / []
And we believe everything you said! 😂 / []
Prince Andrew cooked her tbh / []
a captcha challenge sent me here. / []
“ Do you regret being friends with Epstein “   Answer : No   Distasteful / ['Disgraceful you mean 💯']
It didn't help, Andrew. / []
Sinner / []
A manner unbecomming, lol / []
Disgusting cretin. Why havent the british people put this guy to the guillotine yet? He's lower than dirt / []
Who's here in 2025? / ['yeah...']
Criminal 💯 / ['Load of Absolutely Bullshit 🙏']
Yes guys nothing to see here - there is no list and epstein is innocent / ['Yep, and he paid his victim (he doesn’t remember meeting)12 million out of the kindness of his heart.']
Who’s back after they don’t wanna release the Epstein Files !!!!!!!! Sad they’re tryna hide the truth / []
Fergie and him made a great couple; both so self-unaware. / []
The global elite has cause for concern with this affair. To be part of the "party," you had to be part of the industrial... political elite. Let it slide: a huge financial windfall or great political power. You think Epstein was going to invite small millionaires?!... useless! The 0.1% are freaking out right now... they're all pulling together, hoping the storm will pass, but they all committed these crimes against minors and against society.  To be part of the "Party," you needed a huge amount of power and influence. Hepstein didn't inveigle little rich people... useless. / []
I’m confused… isn’t 17 legal in the uk? / ['He was doing it in the US']
its still baffling to me that there's so many evidence against this man, witness testimony's him admitting to hanging out with epstein and EVEN A PICTURE. bro did an interview which was a total disaster and thats it. No arrest were made, no prison sentence, no nothing. he paid some money to this woman because she knew damn welll he was never gonna get convicted but thats it. / []
his mum never visited israel because she didn't like them (when she was young, the early zionists used to kill british soldiers), yet here he is being interrogated by a jewish woman, about being sexually compromised by two other jewish individuals   crazy / []
He realizes she knows more than he thought 11:47 / []
Guilty as sin / []
Absolute car crash. Couldn't have looked more guilty if he'd tried. Most obvious guilt since O.J. / []
R.I.P  Virginia and all the victims involved these fuckin rich elites are fuckin weirdos and what pisses me off is they never do shit to them / []
When he’s forced to invent untruths relating to dates times and events why then does certain words coming out of his mouth sound wobbly and fumbled out of sync ?? / []
Dig his own grave! He’s like tRump and they are both on the Epstein list. “ too honourable“ narcissistic to the core! “ I didn’t sweat” but he’s sweating know 😂😂 / []
bro says the photo is upstairs in the house and he's never been up there, how then sir do you know the picture was taken upstairs if you've never seen upstairs?  This guy is soooo guilty, the worst liar lmao, doing this interview made his whole situation so much worse / ["his mum paid twelve million pounds out after this, and of course, a few years later, the young girl who gave him the massage is no longer alive \n\ncan't be easy for his own daughters, of a similar age"]
A complete sod! / []
Andrew lies, very poorly. / []
so this is what staring at the face of satan feels like / []
13:41 - "Another guest was John Brockman..." - (°_°) / []
Guilty as f. / []
He, Trump, Clinton etc. should be behind bars for life. / []
Hope the very worst for Andrew and his family of royal child tapist. What would Diana say! / []
This freak is ridiculous 👺👺 / []
To all begginers liars.. this is how you should lie / []
40.37. Epstien is dead. Prince Philip, haha yes.  ????????????? / []
Omg … great comedy 😂😂😂 no words to describe this “honorable “ individual… with great friendships which helped him a lot … 😱 OMG / []
“It was a convenient place to stay.” / []
It still blows my mind that he gave this interview… / ['you have to wonder at this juncture, how many other nobs are sweatily preparing their pizza hut alibi... 🤢']
He is lying a lot with his umm ing / []
10:18 😮 / []
Isn't it amazing how liars' excuses are pretty universal???  It wasn't me, I wasn't there....I was actually dead at the time!" / []
How isn't he locked up, this should be evidence of him completely lying / []
So why would the Royal Family purportedly pay millions of pounds in a settlement to a woman Prince Andrew claims that he never ever met ???. / []
This aged like dog water. How is this dude “Free to travel and is no longer involved in the investigation” wut?! / []
Off topic, her voice is so soothing. I watch this interview to fall asleep lol / []
When someone calls themselves a "conservative," this is what they're conserving. / []
Release the Epstein files now / []
His accuser got offed, yall better not forget who owns you / []
From the outset, he's so obviously completely disingenuous throughout the entirety of this interview, lying shamelessly & prodigiously. What a total disgrace to his family name. I feel truly sorry for this man's mother. Her baby, born of noble birth, grew up to be a gentlemanly, well-dressed, well-spoken, and (new word) unreconstitutable TURD.  Enjoy the rest of your life, Andy. To the rest of us: Let this man's pathetic life story help us all to understand the nature & human consequences of the Power Elite's continual, expanding, and apparently unstoppable machinations in today's world.  ☮♥ / []
Haha haha British clown / ['One thing I’ll say is that I wish more journalist around the world acted like her. He is part of the most powerful family in the world and the fact she came in and asked real questions reminds me how pathetic American journalists really are. Would you ever hear Biden or Trump be asked anything even remotely close to this confrontational? Never']
“I do not sweat, I didn’t sweat at the time” what a damn fool! / []
This is what a guilty person looks like / []
The sweating response will go down as the dumbest answer in history.   He’s the type of person that says well my victim is now dead, so nothing happened, right? 😂 / ["The timing of her 'suicide' right before the whole epstein files blow up is suss", '\u200b@jamespopovic9750Well never see them!!', 'I almost feel sorry for him.']
It’s crazy how he managed to remember all these very specific circumstances but he ‘doesn’t remember’ having sex with that girl / []
Will be get his mummy's 16 million back now the epstein files never existed 😂😂😂 / []
Not once does he acknowledge the pain the victims had to go through. He never states he would never ever have inappropriate contact with a minor.  Instead he  tries to get out of it on made up technicalities, which indicates he was never held accountable for anything in his entire life. Even calling himself "too honorable" because he couldn't decline staying at a convicted s*x offenders house. The queen and her husband raised a monster. / []
He liked going to Epstein’s place because it was an amazing place “to learn.” Wow / []
Prince Andrew is amazingly bad at this. / []
This interview is absolutely grotesque. / []
So he finds himself an extraordinary person. There you go. / []
Has anyone ever tried to deny what they did. I can tell you folks, i have been in that position. I am familiar with his demeanor and anyone reading this knows it😂 / []
It's impossible that's me in the photo since I didn't have a left arm at the time, it's grown back since then. / ['LOL … well the victim is dead… it means I’m now innocent, right?']
Virginia Giuffre, she did work as escort when she was 8 years old for her family to blackmail the people who has sex with her, why she doesn't report to court, prince Andrew its free man. Ancient not guilty, she did make so much money from blackmail many people did have sex with them, when she was 8 years old, she was professional, he mother did teach her, how to have sex / ['Your point?', 'lol okay']
He hv even more speedbrakers in his speech than whole united kingdom hv on their roads .he is too hilarious but seems like verginia giuffre manipulated him fr huge amount of money an ruined his image as royal prince / []
His way of saying "No" in this interview suggests he did everything what he was saying no to. / ['Came here for the comments some good ones!.\nAndrew should also consider a career as a comedian!!']
FIRE THE PUBLICIST! / []
Peter Pettigrew looking pathetic petty man. / []
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 yuk / []
looks like a 5 year old / []
lol / []
I really wish Virginia didn’t settle. Rest in peace ❤ / ['Why ? ❤', 'She didn’t have much of a choice, the rules relating to offers, & costs if you lose & refuse an offer, meant she faced an extraordinary risk once he made the enormous offer.', '@Suwu500Sav a hearing would have resulted in evidence coming out.']
Just for kicks i rewatched the interview gets better every time. What a schmuck.  Didn’t just shot himself in the foot- he ahot them both off / ["there's just so much to extrapolate, like every minute is golden - towards the end he starts railing against social media because people say stuff [about royals], and then vaguely tries to form a mental health defense\n\nit's incredibly rare these type of people give these sort of unguarded interviews, and for so long as well, no legal counsel whatsoever, bizarre"]
Well, at least it’s very clear to us, and it being reassured that he likes little children, specifically girls. / []
This is Monty python level comedy. What a clown and disgrace! / ['Haha 😅', 'Perhaps Andrew only has a flesh wound.', 'And yet he’s still a free man…', '@ledfarmergamerI know he’s still a free man but honestly his life is over, he finished himself this very day.', 'exactly. totally convinced me he did it all and more 😢']
He shakes his head no to just about everything even when he says yes lol / []
5:49 how horrible that the man who was supposed to protect children was involved in abusing and s@x trafficking of them / []
Whe he was young, he was wild!!! / []
Guilty 💯💯💯💯💯 jail time!!! / []
It's like talking to a kid you caught red handed stealing a cookie out of the cookie jar. / []
GUILTY AS SIN / []
prince andrew is exactly the type of guy that would do something with epstein. / []
“Here’s the problem.  I’ve never seen Epstein with a camera in my life.”   Ok case closed. / []
This guy was friends not only with Epstein but with disgraced Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard who is currently serving a prison time for running an elaborate sophisticated sex trafficking ring with thousands of alleged victims. / []
Seriously... Is there any sane person who believes this..... / []
Yeah right you pervert. .. We believe you / []
Viva las revolution!!!; / []
He's just like the rest of the RF,self entitled bed hoppers. / []
Got to give it this guy, he has got some front / []
No no no I couldn’t sweat at the time HAHAHAHA / []
What a pos, hope he rots in jail one day / []
wait if he‘s never actually been upstairs, how did he recognize that the photo was taken upstairs? 🧐 / []
Imagine the royal family watching this! / []
His tendency to be too honorable! 😂 / []
@bbc don’t coverup for pervert andrew 😢like you covering up for israel atrocities  #EpsteinCoverup / []
Here is how to get saved and be right with God; 1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in one way or another. Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB)  10. "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 11."There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God." 12."They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one." 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  2-Realize that God loved us, even as sinners enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, as a free gift to whosoever accepts it.  Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." 12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”  3-Confess unto God to ask to be forgiven of your sins, by accepting this freely given gift of forgiveness.  1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB) 1."Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2."By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB) 9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10."For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." 13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB) 27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" 28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Revelation 21: 8 (KJB) "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  Romans 6: 23 (KJB) “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.) “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.  I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins.  I trust in him alone to save me.  Nothing else.  Not my good works or anything else.  Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.” / []
Never forget! / []
20:00 why wouldn't you say this as the first and most important part of your defence in this matter? Why list a dozen of other things? If you weren't there then it would close the case. This guy is a terrible liar.  25:20 unless you don't want to be easily recognized.  6:00 vs 34:40 .. Make a choice Andrew..  No empathy, not a single word of understanding or compassion for the victims in this case. This man is a horrible excuse for a human being. / []
I dunno... I like him / []
Thank god morons like him exist / []
Has @theBehaviorPanel analyzed this one? At 5:10 watch his blink rate increase as he says “there was no indication that Epstein was doing these thing” (relating to the trafficking stuff).  Only 5min in I feel this guy is full of shait and can’t wait for the rest of it. / []
46:06 anger / []
36:50 this would all be comedic if it werent so sad / []
, According to an Epsteen attorney radio interview [which i personally heard], Dr. Baden's forensics proved that Epsteen's neck had been broken with a powerful karate chop from behind, which had instantly killed him, before he was hanged.   Ehud-Barak was collecting Epsteen-Maxwell blackmail rape tapes chokeholds on Trump + USA-EU-ZIO government SWAMPLANDERS, making Trump SatanYahu's pet-puppy 🐶 🐕 / []
Can the BBC interview the POTUS..we need a intervention across the pond / []
Obvious liar. No consequences whatsoever. Always the same / []
why is this guy still free? / ['Trump was best friend with Epstein yet went on to become President', "He's an elite, a prince, he was entitled to have young flesh brought to him on a weekly basis.", 'Money and power', '16 mil']
Photogŕaph?? / []
If I would have known him from anywhere, i can imagine i would have been attracted to his (non sexual) invitations lock stock and barrel! Assuming he would say he would help me and give me kosher food and all manor of career oportunities etc. Little would i know it would only be my destruction. OR, could it be i WOULD have succeeded in my life through this friendship and just ignore the fact that it came through his help, and no one would see the connection? I mean, high society!  Or dubious mish mash? / []
Youre telling me this mans innocent? 😂 / []
You can see the terror in his voice and face. Difficult to lie / []
This interview is aging like milk, very sour😢Rotten to the core  He should be in prison! / []
I know it’s a photo of me with my hand around her waist but PDA is not something I’m in to… do what you may with that information  🙄🙄 / []
So if all what you say is true, why did you pay such a large amount in the plea bargain? / []
The bbc protecting this monster / []
Thick skin / []
still can't believe this happened i struggle to put food on my table and this guy isn't sweating in pizza express in woking / []
Anyone here in July 2025? "there is no epstein list!"😮😂 / ['😂', 'im here in 2035', '@AV-xm5ln still no list.', "It's crazy. The amount of powerful people on it must be something else.

He makes Jeffrey sound like a chap who was round quite a lot / []
5:50 "at the time I was patron of the NSPPC Full Stop Campaign so I was closeup with what was going on in those (deep inhale) uh times about getting rid of abuse to children so I knew what was what the things were to look for  (shakes head) but I never saw them"  Sketchy AF / []

I wander if he has any recollection of this interview 5 years on / []
Andrew has totally humiliated himself here. Not very bright is he / []
All the security boys watching and making sure this is ok - come on lads. What if that's  your sister or my sister? / []
Yes, perfect sense / []
Tell me you’re guilty without telling me you’re guilty: / ['He is guilty or poor judgement and entitlement, but there is no evidence he is guilty of any criminal offence. The woman who accused him has been proved to be a liar, and in any case she was not below the legal age of consent even if she was telling the truth. It’s just people loving gossip, if he wasn’t a Royal nobody would even care.']
He is so full of it! / []
For the sake of abused children everywhere, this POS needs to spill the beans! He's constantly virtue-signaling, yet his head shakes, "no." Give me a break! Tell us what you know. / []
GO IN JAIL you rapist ! !! IN JAIL NOW!! / []
Thousands of underage US girls were abused by a UK duke, Trump's associates, and others—this is worse than the B2 bombings or Gaza / []
The way prince Andrew speaks gives away he never had friends getting at him when he was spreading out complete bullshit / []
100% Innocent  KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK Lisboa Portugal / []
He considers himself an extraordinary person? Sick. / []
Eyes dont lie. / []
Guys!! Trump has just said there is nothing to see here, can't we just leave this creepy entitled sexual predator alone, no one wants to hear about epstien anymore apart from the entire western world, Please leave the poor elites alone / []
Epstein to Andrew: you can use my houses Andrew: it would be a considerable stretch to say he was a very close friend  lol / []
When his time on earth is up he won’t be a prince of privilege anymore. He will be judged like all of us and when the hour glass sand sends its last grain to the bottom judgement begins. He should remember that and beg for forgiveness and mercy. My take! / ['Well said']
Hindsight is 20/20... / []
I think someone should send this to the POTUS / []
if a lie detector used on this guy it could go crazy / []
This is why the list won’t ever get released. It has US politicians and foreign royalty and foreign politicians. Wouldn’t doubt it if Bush and Bin Ladin got some poor girl together. / []
According to recent news, Andrew apparently had nothing to worry about whatsoever! Who knew! / []
Child Rapist / []
He needs a visit from Luigi / []
Feels like he is parodying his own interview / []
It was not a party ... it was just a dinner This guy is so dumb ! OMG / []
Someone needs to park something in this TICK'S brain pan.. / []
I honestly think the queen knew of Prince andrew guilt no wonder she paid the 12 million just goes to show the royal family for who they really are. / []
If he is not lying then i am the Prince of Wales🤣🤣 / []
Im here after Candace❤ / []
who's sweating here in 2025 but not sweating? / []
Epstein was a Mossad agent who ran a blackmail operation involving underage girls. Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell, was also a Mossad agent. Israel gave him a state funeral, and he is buried on Mount Olives. Follow the money, and you will see that all of Epstein's activities were designed to benefit Israel. Epstein had relationships with William Burns (CIA Director), Les Wexner, Ronald Lauder, Alan Dershowitz, Rupert Murdoch, Mark Zuckerberg, Ehud Barak, and Ariane Langner de Rothschild ("WSJ News Exclusive - Epstein's Private Calendar Reveals Prominent Names, Including CIA Chief, Goldman's Top Lawyer"). Virginia Giuffre was one of the most public and outspoken victims of Epstein. They tried to kill her on March 31; her car was hit by another vehicle, leaving her seriously injured. She was hospitalized but survived. Shortly before this false flag operation to cover up the truth, which claimed Epstein acted alone and was not a spy, Virginia Giuffre was killed in her home on April 25. Her death was announced as a suicide. / []
What? Where? Who? When? Why? / []
This interview is better than any satire piece. / []
What a load of contradictory twaddle. Look at his expression at 38.15 when she mentions Epstein's suicide. His demeanour changed straight away from being a tearful victim to a hard face, angry man. What a narcissist. / []
I didn't bang her because I can't recall Jeff having a camera. / []
i knew he was telling the truth / []
Truth is, this goes beyond the physical realm. It's a spiritual warfare more now than ever in our entire History. Sure, U can live in comfort and enjoy the benefits of this physical realm on the expense of innocent sufferers. Ima tell you how u can get rich if you want to trade a life of righteousness, for a life of pleasure in the name of sin(Guiltiness rest on their conscience) (They eat the bread of sorrow) just know everyone is ultimately and rightfully responsible for their own choices. We have been struggling because of this same systematic with It's inequalities, unjustfulness, discriminatory ways. Don't be weak, Don't give up. Have Faith, Those who have faith have it all. Those who know, Know. And you can pretend to turn the cheek. God of heaven says if you know better, then it is expected of you to do better. The lord see's all. He is the Unseen Guest. He is a Justful God. Some people are so poor that money is all they have. ICE and deportation centers are profiting from what they are doing now. ICE and detention centers for migrants are in contract with corporations who are profiting in the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE) listed under the Publicly Traded Private Prison Corporations list as ; -The GEO Group (GEO) -CoreCivic (CXW) -LASalle Corrections -Management Training Corporation  But Know this, Life and health cannot be bought. Just ask David Rockefeller about all the heart transplants and still no success. Which did happen but they manage to censor the internet. Meanwhile there is other people who have been on a waitlist for years for just 1 heart transplant. Or ask Pope Francis, He died the day before Jesus Resurrection.  Or ask  George Bush Sr. Or Elizabeth aka Alizard from england. No amount of money or social status can surpass the true riches and blessings of God of light,love and heaven. Joy, Peace, Happiness, Health, Love, Contentmen. Divine protection and guidance. Living a life in truth. True satisfaction. The true ruler, virtuous in all of his glory. God hired me, who gonna fire me?  Which side are you on? ~DaRealest~ / []
Please open ur ears, open ur eyes, and realize what's been going on. Innocent children need us Good morale Adults. We were children at one time too. We are the adults now. We are the difference makers. Reality is Children were being trafficked for sinful acts. This kind of service and market wasn't free or cheap. Jeffrey Epstein lived a luxurious lifestyle and knew many people in power. That's not common for the common folk. Who has an island they own? Exactly!!!!  ~DaRealest~ / []
🤡🤡🤡 / []
Liar / []
liar / []
Who let this man do this interview?! 😮 / []
I watch alot of the professional profiler videos on Youtube and this guy has soo many tells of lies in this interview with his body languages even in the first 15 minutes. Excessive blinking, forcing confused faces, throwing hands in the air, shaking of head pre-emptively / ['Also additional big tells verbally " he says the photograph looks to have been taken upstairs. Yet he\'s never been upstairs he says multiple times then how the hell did he know what the upstairs looked like. What a fool.']
10 seconds in and his tie pissing me off, he's royal and his tie crooked / ['Even the tie sick of the bs! 😂😂😂😂😂😂']
This seems like a comedy movie scene / []
Worst choice to do an interview EVER!! LOL. Nobody I know believes Epstein was a suicide. Nobody believes what Prince (& I use that term loosely) Andrew says for most of this interview. While he might not have regretted his close, but not too close, friendship w/ JE at the time of this interview, I'd bet he does now since he is THE least seen royal in modern times! Does he even do any of the things royals usually do, bridge openings or whatnot? I've not seen any royal engagements w/ Andrew in attendance. / []
Am i the only one who comes back to watch this trainwreck from time to time even years later? Every time im just as stunned as the first time i saw it. This interview is the epitome of dumpster fire. Just cant look away. / ['Yup.']
horrible liar cant believe hes getting away with it / []
He is SO FULL of SH*T and SUCH a D-BAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
"I didnt sweat at the time" 😂😂 Man this was a wild interview / []
47:27 but before that we had an absolute blast.    The only way you can be this incriminating to yourself and not get charged is if you are royalty. 🤴 / []
Here after the "claim" there was no list / []
How is this lizard not banged up is beyond me. / []
How the actual fuck is this man not sitting in a prison.. royalty or not / []
Just watched the released video from tha jail. Good to know he didn’t kill himself. / []
Prince Andrew sounds like a liar.  RIP Virginia Guiffre, I'm sorry you and other victims got no justice. / ['He is. Point after point being made against him. He has a guilty look.', 'not over yet.', 'How did she pass? She was young, foul play suspected?', '\u2060@JeffSax-us8zcVery strange to me. Princess Diana, Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre all presented difficulties for the royal family and all three die under mysterious circumstances. Where there is smoke, there is fire and this is definitely not a coincidence.', "RIP? She didn't pass"]
Crock of shit / []
Why tf did this dummy do this interview when theres apparently no reason to think anyone else was involved? / []
You are under arrest in the name of the law, you have the right to remain silent because anything you say will be used against you in court, you have the right to a lawyer provided by the state if you can't afford one.🤣😂 / []
Money talks But it don't sing and dance and it don't walk / []
This interview was an unmitigated disaster. My word! Throughout the interview, he has no cognizance of the fact that he is talking about a convicted sex offender. No visible repugnance, no strong disapproval, no sympathy expressed toward the victims. In the first ten minutes there are things like:  I traveled to visit, stay with,  and have dinner parties with a  convicted sex offender just months after his release from prison.  Said convicted sex offender told me that he had taken a plea deal.  I told him that because of the increased scrutiny on me we couldn't continue to be friends ( not because, you know, he is a repulsive child sex trafficker).  I still do not regret my friendship with the convicted sex offender.   Blimey! / []
13:42 when John Brockman was mentioned, why did he react that way?!?! 😮👀 / []
Seems to me he may haveore them likely been in love with Virginia. His eyes read that he smiles with his eyes when told that Virginia said they had sex three times. Probably also why he won't call her a direct liar. / []
For someone who doesn't drink seems he has issues with his memory, conveniently. Absolutely not , would've been a better answer than no recollection, the typical answer for someone who's lying and being directed by an attorney. / []
He looks like a little boy being questioned by his mother when she asks if he danced and had sex with this young woman. What a crock of shit. First he said he'd never been to the bar then he said he didn't drink at the bar. He's lying but of course he's not going to tell the truth!!!! / []
I dont sweat either haha / []
Stuttering Stanley / []
At the same time he didn’t sweat,he also didn’t have feet… / []
This guy could have said "Yes I did all that's alleged. So what of it?" And we would do nothing... / []
Hes just gonna deny it, they all deny not knowing what was happening... "There's no list" etc. they give the same lawyer to Epstein and the freak off guy who gets off which no one can comprehend given the evidence. It's obvious what they are doing and we all know it. / []
well this didnt age well, AMERICA IS ABOUT TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT BACK. Fk a world war, civil war 2 dont be on the wrong side / []
This guy is a child abuser - how is he not in jail? / []
Mozzad job / []
Prince Andrew lying on camera for a complete whole entire 49 minutes and 26 seconds folks! Can't miss it / []
Yes …I do believe I did! / []
I said your awfully naughty Andrew and ma'am was very displeased with your pedaphilec behaviour, your a lying POS period / []
😂😂😂😂😂GREAT BRITAIN / []
That’s not my hand in the photo , I don’t have any hands 🙌 / []

So sad that people lie and can’t tell the truth. / []
jaajajaajajajajajajajaja saludos desde Mexico / []
Andrew said he met politciand., scholars., UN people. and businessmen in Epstein parties...they must be big and famous.why dont they get testimony about them from him and bring them all to light. There are such a lot of big shots incolved in this scandal.Andrew is the only one who is arrogantly.foolish to get pictured / []
The Mossad got Virginia / []
So if he was the queens's favourite kid, what does that say about her? Children like that are hardly a compliment for any parent. Liz failed as a mother. / []
Am I the only one that believes the words of this kind, honest, gentle, wise and INNOCENT man?!? God save you Sir Andrew, good knight of Albion!! 🇬🇧🤥 / []
Horrendous pedophile. Woody Allen American style. / ['Bignoze is after our children']
"getting him in one place " must have been near impossible to get to a man when hes on an island surrounded by the sea ... / []
"I've gone through this in my mind , so many times " yet you still gave the most ridiculous possible answer to this question in an interview the entire world was going to see ... / []
so cringe / []
Man, stay away from Epstein / []
Abolish the monarchy! / ['Diana’s death didn’t do it so no it won’t happen…']
The only reason Prince Andrew wanted to speak about this was because Epstein was dead. Andrew and his mother orchestrated the death of Epstein / ['No someone else did…']
U where caught bye the b…. Simple. / []
Lie after  lie / []
He is saying the same thing all the time he is an embarassment / []
Guilty as sin / []
It’s strange that he thought this interview went well. / []
"and that's the bit that I remember is going to the dinner parties where you would meet academics, politicians, people from the United Nations".....in other words CHILD and SEX TRAFFICKING RINGS...!! when the powerful mingle, the devil lurks😈 / []

Lier,I went to same school as her and it’s all been such a shock even now / []
Classic lies; Ihave no recollection does not mean it did not happen. / []
I have never seen a more embarassing and confusing than this. / []
The more he talks the more he fucks himself up 😂 / []
Andy we believe you no sweat literally 😂 / []
He should  have listened too mam. / []
He didn't do any thing.   Jimmy  fixt it / []
Iv took  the pony's. Out for a trot / []

The destination for my love I love prince Andrew  Drew that foto in that black top you can have it❤😂🎉 / []
He is so vile. / []
An attentive one can always tell a lowlife-liar from a honored person, despite the attire and the accent.  Body language is somewhat harder to cover up and the shifty eyes in the acute questions. The babbling and searching of getaway ideas, while thinking whether it is going to sound like a lie (it is), says it all. / []
Andrew : hi epstein how is it going,                     Epstein :hi man it's been awhile now  Andrew : yes that's right I was not around.by the way I wish to see you  Epstein :yes I will be glad to have you back. Andrew : in fact I'm Going to travel half of the planet to come to you to say.i'm not seeing it in continuing friendship with you and then I get back home.amazing is'n'it / []
An absolute scumbag / []
Nothing wrong with Prince Andrew. She was a paid slut. A lying one. / []
Hey dude there's a Latitude conversation are you are you paying attention😂❤😂 / []
The Fresh Prince of Belgravia / []
shedual! / []
His contradictions are so absurd that he falls into stupidity. First he states over and over that he is friend of Epstein’s girlfriend, not of Epstein himself, that he is no even a close friend of his. HOWEVER, he took a transatlantic flight to come “face-to-face” with Epstein and break up with their “friendship” because that was the “honorable” thing to do”? So he was only his acquaintance or he cared so much about his close-friendship? Which one is it? LIAR! / []
😊 / []
This right here is a masterclass in how to look guilty as hell on global television. “I don’t sweat”, “Can’t recall the photo”, but can vividly remember a random trip to Pizza Express in Woking two decades ago? Give us a break. The only thing more cooked than this story is Andrew’s royal reputation. His body language is a walking confession, twitchy eyes, stiff as a corpse, fake half smiles like he’s trying to bluff his way out of a war crime. He wasn’t answering questions, he was stalling for time like a kid caught red handed with the cookie jar lid still in his hand. And let’s not pretend this was some noble effort to clear his name. This was a failed PR hit job dressed up in a suit and royal entitlement. The guy thought he could charm his way through a scandal with the emotional range of a houseplant and the believability of a pantomime villain. If this is what royal accountability looks like, then God save us all, because the monarchy clearly won’t. / []
You 🤬lair / []
Prince is a natural comedian 🤠 / []
He is a prince by divine right. I dont understand why he is questioned in any way... Especially by a commener. / []
What a mumbling lying ponce, too bad hes too powerful to go to jail / []
8 or ten of us and one girl who was under age is what he is trying to say / []
😂😂😂😂😂 / []
I cannot believe he was the Queens favorite.such a bullshitter. I went to see him after he was in jail. To tell him we can't be seen together wtf. He isn't this stupid he would have known what was going on. / []
When Jesus comes back you all are fucked! / []
Talk about digging your own grave 😂😂😂😂 / []
He never says I DIDN'T DO THAT , just he doesn't recall.  His smugness is incredible. / []
Rewatching 😂 2025 / []
Great interview. / []
What's that am I supposed to impress you or what😂❤🎉 / []
He must think ordinary people are thick as mince ! / []
You can clearly see, that he truly just didn't care. Which is, in itself, abhorrent, but not as bad as what he did here. He should have just told them "I was too engulfed in being this dickheads friend to think about the questionable stuff I saw and experienced". But no, he tried to deny it, which makes it worse.   Noone would bat an eye at a posh douchebag - a royal douchebag even - not caring about the bad things their friends do. / []
Prince Andrew think he fooling us with his diabolical voice and leg cross over / []
49 minutes and 27 seconds of total, pathetic LIES & BETRAYAL ! / []
I have no recollection! I will use that for ever 😂 / []
When buying young pussy goes wrong smh / []
Royal family knew all this fuck Britain / []
Dead peados dont reofend / []

Maitlis is a supporter of groomers but not if your White / ['Exactly. \nHas she interviewed any of the racist rapegangers? Nope.\nHas she interviewed any of their enablers (police, local councillors, etc.)? Nope.\nConclusion: sexual abuse is only bad when perpetrated by white men.\ni.e. standard Cleftian (cultural left) ideology.']
The fact that the british royal family protects this guy and he’s not behind bars lets me know he’s got some serious dirt on those protecting him! / ['Thats the royal family for you 😆', 'It honestly makes me sick. Those girls deserve justice.']
He is the most smug, entitled man I've ever heard / []
RADA says no, Andrew.... Not at all convincing, dear / []
The best for you to change it to it's a better life if you change it for you I need to be changed immediately decide or not or whatever cuz I don't give a fuk cuz I'm not looking at your husband❤😂 / []
BYE RICO BOY / []
What a bad liar. Nothing he said made sense. Just rambling about nothing to dodge the questions / []
Nodding head up and down at the same time saying no. Dead giveaway. / []
I'm still watching this shit and it's mind bogling HE AND THE "ROYAL FAMILY " are still here, what's wrong with you English people? It's costing you a  fortune to sustain them, spend the money on the poor that look at this and find it disgusting. / []
Guilty! / []
All this has served to know much of the horrible personality of “Andy”, with or without Epstein liaisons he is know to be worst member of the RF. / []
The nude children photographs decorating the walls didn't raise any alarm bells while you were staying in his house? Mate... Come on.  Also watch his face! He has so many tells. I really want to play poker with him now 😅 / []
Indian came in from Jamaica with the money laundering he's the first one I know when he came here Denny's telling me he's been lying to me that that apartment belongs to Jamaican but that is that's where his wife she is Pyro and every time I said something to Elon Musk and the Indians they jump to it because that's where I thought the money laundering came in right there❤😂🎉 / []
Isn't it strange how much has happened on the World stage since Virginia's death. This interview is so telling. Revolting man. / []
It’s a true reflection of the system , when immigration, legal as well as illegal , is spiralling out of control , yet nobody seems to be able to get Andrew out of the Uk , to answer some probing questions regarding his perversions .     Maybe If someone agreed  to pack his 70 plus teddies in a suitcase , he might agree to take a flight out . / []
After we saw the union and it's a few of them is involved a f****** horse in bushes did we saw the excellent catch on a horse sometime ago on in a bush😂❤🎉 / []
He thank her after she f&£ked him. Brilliant / []
All work I do on the internet proceeded to prince Andrew and the British manocar❤😂🎉 / []
I will be home to you soon as I get the money right my boss doesn't want to get rid of me yet see you soon the faith is stronger than ever there's no way back okay so just hold tight hold tights❤😂🎉 / []
Emily nailed him . He thought he did really well . Oh how wrong he was . 😂 / []
I believe Virgina….may she rest in peace. / []
A stupid Psychopath / []
Is there even a condition that makes u not sweat ? But then once u not stressed it resolves ? He talks a load of shit and protests too much ! / []
Why is he still walking the streets of London? He should have been tried in America and CONVICTED . This interview alone shows his guilt ! How he sleeps at night is beyond me ! His daughters need to be given a shake also as they can’t surely believe this ?  He IS A SX OFFENDER 😊 / []
LIAR! Sorry, "honourable" LIAR! / []
This is the kind of interview where the audience is more uncomfortable than the interviewee. / ["To be fair to Andrew he's had that many women it's possible he's forgotten a few. I don't believe him though."]

Sick royal man / []
Reptilian crown / []
I remember driving home listening to this interview on the radio that evening. I was constantly cringing and shaking my head in disbelief at what Andrew was saying. I was thinking to myself that this was more of a plane crash than a car crash for him. / []
What a disgusting piece of work / []
Someone needs to put him away. He needs to be charged with sex trafficking. I hope the truth is found and not hushed / []
LOL. He expects people to believe his staff would be OKAY with people coming and going from Epstein’s house with a Prince there? Bullshit. / []
This hasn't improved with time. / []
These people are foul as hell. He doesnt deserve a life of royalty. He should be treated like the scum he is. Does he think he was fooling anyone with this interview? / []
Did Virginia really kill herself? / []
Here after watching ‘Scoop’ / []
4 days to break up with his friend but we had to party (small party 6 or 8 people)I couldn’t get that many people in my house 😂😂😂 / []
All this interview needed was him to start sweating / []
He’s just too damned honourable / []
He should be in jail / []
He only took the stand because he had no other choice and he’s a pathethical liar that starts to believe in his own lies / []
Epstein was found dead: yep In prison: yes In August of this year: yup What was your response to hearing he died: shock Some people think he didn't take his own life: <laughs> I can't answer that question / []
I could not have had sex with her as during the falklands War I lost my ability to have an erection as a result of being fired on / []

What a story line 🤮 / []
I think prince Andrew is classy !🤣 or is he the monster? / []
Going to Jeffery's =💩 / []
Why did he ‘have’ to go see him , a supposed casual friend via his girlfriend. / []
How stupid to lie and embarrass yourself on national tv when you ended up paying money either way / []
Stomach churning. / []
Not "good friends", but had to "break up the friendship" on a private walk??? Ya, ok bud. / []
How convoluted. / []
Guilt is gushing out of his pores. / []
Dude, why did you do this interview?! Haha smh  And is his tie supposed to look like that? / []
Im back for refill / []
Like watching a praying mantis, eyeing up/toying with a morsel for tea. Amazing he didnt realise the presenter was taking him apart, piece by piece during the interview. 😂 / []
Ha ha ha / []
The crimes of underage children that this family is responsible for is unfathomable. / []
He is totally lying, observe his body language when some hard questions are put to him and he is all over and listen to his answers when he is answering tough question, he keeps mumble and I am layman and have zero credibility on psychology and I can say he totally lying and he did exploited some poor under age girls and I bed on my life / []
what a fuckin liar he is. How convenient Virginia Giuffre is now gone. This is a guy who has been described by many as an absolute pig, a sex pest, who had 72 teddy bears that had to be arranged just so on his bed every day and if it wasn't done right he'd pitch a fit - arrogant, who viewed everyone beneath him as nobodies unworthy of any respect and consideration. He was probably aching to go off in a rage at the interviewer, swear and scream don't you know who I am?!? Don't ask me these questions! How DARE you?!? The one person who had absolute cart blanch to come and go as she pleased at the palace was none other than his little buddy ghislane maxwell. This guy is a monster who ought to be facing really hard questions and put behind bars. / []

I think a hired duck could have stumbled its way through this interview better than he did. I mean, it's almost like an SNL skit. Totally, utterly, outlandishly, absurd. / []
I had to look up what a, “shooting weekend” is. These British aristocrats are demented. Why does the UK maintain a “Royal” family??? As an American, it is beyond bizarre and it makes total sense why the patriot revolutionaries didn’t want to be under these people’s thumbs. / []

She ignores all of his excuses, and he's so thick that he thinks he's doing well. So much so, that he gave her a tour afterwards. His handlers told him not to do this, but he is so arrogant that he went ahead anyway. I wish I could see him read the headlines the next morning. / []

The liar little fuck”r / []
Just saw this interview today 😊 / []
Here after watching Scoop / []
"I HAD to go and see him" after Epstein's release from prison - no! No! Andrew then falls back on the "convenience" of staying with him! He DIDN'T "have to" - this is someone with unlimited money who could obviously have stayed in the best hotel's presidential suite. Andrew wasn't hard up for a crash pad! There is NO REASON to be in any proximity to a convicted felon just released from prison! / []
The "(false statement for social propriety) BUT (what he really thinks)" construction is so striking here - Prince Andrew makes a conciliatory statement followed by "BUT" and then some excuse. / []
He didn't have to go to Epstein's house IN PERSON to say "We can't be SEEN together" - he could have just given him a call or - better yet - had one of this staff pass along the message without him getting personally involved at all. Bad misstep, Prince Andrew - you can't just handwave THAT away because we can all SEE it! / []
"I never noticed anything and even if I had, it was a long time ago and things were different then and etc. etc." / []
Honestly, I'm surprised his tie is so wonky. Why wasn't there a stylist or manservant or whatever royals have to curate their public image there to make sure he looked properly dressed? / []
I think it’s only fair that someone with not much money should accept a few rooms for the night for free / []
He didn’t do anything wrong that lady wanted money / []

What a disaster of an interview. This reporter called him out on all his BS. Why are you meeting with him when you know he’s a registered sex offender? / []
THE LYING PERVERT........................... / []
Many many things to un pack but the absolute non empathy for the victims made his guilt seem even more easy to see and when stated that Epstein was now dead, he unconsciously laughed or a sniggered laugh which to me gave the game away! Meaning he new exactly how Epstein was murdered and couldn’t hide his relief with his sniggered laugh which was a double edged laugh of knowing how he was murdered by the mossad agents or mi5 and his relief in Epstein being dead. The day Epstein died was the day he told the fbi that he was going to leak all his information and footage of who was at these freak offs! He went back to his cell after this meeting to snitch on all the people he had blackmailed with the footage and his testimony of what he knew. He was in a better mood than he had been in since being at the prison MCC and was happy that he knew his sentence would be radically reduced. Once this info got back to the royal family and agents the plot was put into action. An Italian mafia body builder was put into his cell the same evening when no other inmate was allowed to share a cell with Epstein whilst he was at the prison and he was on an hourly watch to make sure he didn’t commit suicide. The Italian mob guy was in for murder and he strangled Epstein to death that night whilst the prison officers were told to pretend to go to sleep and all cameras at mcc were Tyrone’s off for 2 hours so the inmate could be shipped out of the prison and could be set free at a later date from another prison. The inmates at that time gave witness statements to this but no media outlets would air this across the world. Also Virginia Duffey was murdered because she was lining up more court cases for other prominent figures that abused her.. / []

the photo questioning is insane - so if he cant recollect - the fact he tries recollect implicitly means there is something to recollect , there must have been occasions when he would have an arm around girls, he just doesnt remember either it ss this girl or not, i whish interviewer more explicitly pointed at that  and asked that / []
What a royal pain in the @@@@ / []
i am honorable, because i need to break off with my friend personally, but i am not as close to him as you might think. what a looser, the only thing i give to him, is he said i am lying thru this whole interview without saying those actual words. what an easy case for any detective, any lamest police officer he would be, any language or speech expert. its right there in the open, but of his royalness he is untouchable. / []
I had to go and see him to tell him this was the end, all the while insisting they were just good friends. I remember when this interview first came out - it was shredded to pieces. Watching it for the first time years later, I completely understand why. Hearing that statement and the rest of his mumbling from a member of the royal family, someone in that position, with so much weight and privilege to their status, is surreal. Anyone else would have been questioned far more intensely, maybe even prosecuted, but royal family members live under a different set of laws. It’s astonishing. For this reason alone, no one should be royal. Monarchies shouldn’t exist - they’re relics of past when we didn’t know better and believed some people were inherently superior to others. That’s exactly why democracies came into being: to correct this crude mistake of elevating a single person as if they were more god-like, which has led to so much madness. / []

He's words should have been. Hearsay is nothing but a word of a witch, liar liar, their panties are on fire. Broke witch, messing with my game. Before she claimed to have met me, she had no fame. The witch is worser than a, gold digger. She 'obviously has admitted, to hanging around dirty old men, before she even claimed, to have even have met me. Seeing a man at a house, thats not his. Now trying to treat him like he reads the VIZ.  How the fugging hell, am I resposible for my frenemies house. All I know,. Free bveer and food, free bed, fug, everything was free as shyte. Just like when I stayed at diddy house. Whatever their upto in that house, is their fugging business. people get drunk in that house, and all their stories, are FUZZY.  I was in love with a stripper, now their all calling me names, like jack the ripper.

The photograph of Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell, reportedly taken by Jeffrey Epstein on March 10, 2001, is supported by substantial evidence as authentic, including development records, witness testimonies, and FBI documentation. The original print is missing, likely lost during Giuffre’s move to Australia, but its absence doesn’t undermine the photo’s credibility due to scanned copies and corroborating accounts. The image remains a critical symbol of Giuffre’s allegations, though it doesn’t directly prove abuse. Claims of fakery by Andrew and Maxwell appear driven by self-interest and lack concrete evidence, making the photo a likely genuine record of a controversial moment.  The Mail on Sunday reported that the back of the original photograph bears a date stamp indicating it was developed on March 13, 2001, at a Walgreens pharmacy in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Giuffre’s then-home. This suggests the photo was a standard print from a disposable Kodak camera, making digital manipulation highly unlikely at the time due to technological limitations.  - **Photographer’s Testimony**: Michael Thomas, a photographer who worked with Mail on Sunday reporter Sharon Churcher, viewed the original print in 2011 in Australia. Thomas took 39 copies of the image (front and back) and described claims of it being fake as “ridiculous” and “absurd,” citing the physical nature of the print and its context within a collection of other photos from Giuffre’s time with Epstein.  FBI Involvement**: Giuffre stated in a 2016 deposition that she provided the original photo to the FBI in 2011 as part of their Epstein investigation. The FBI returned it after scanning, and a post on X references a CD from the FBI featuring images taken by Giuffre, suggesting official acknowledgment of the photo.  Maxwell’s Prior Statement**: In a 2015 email to lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Maxwell responded to a query about the photo’s authenticity by saying, “It looks real. I think it is.” This contradicts her later claims that the photograph was fake. (Trying to save her own skin, don’t forget she’s a convicted sex predator like Epstein so taking her word about anything is laughable)  The photo was one of several from Giuffre’s collection, kept in a white envelope and stored in a bookcase. Its existence aligns with Giuffre’s detailed accounts of being trafficked to London and meeting Prince Andrew, supported by other witnesses like Carolyn Andriano, who testified that Giuffre told her in 2001 about sleeping with Andrew.   The photo’s physical development in 2001 predates widespread digital editing tools, and experts cited by the Mail on Sunday stated it would be “essentially impossible” to doctor a physical print convincingly at that time.  The photo was a standard print, developed at a one-hour Walgreens lab. The back shows a date stamp (March 13, 2001), and it was stored with other photos from Giuffre’s time with Epstein. The uncropped version includes a thumb, adding to its physical authenticity.  - **Giuffre’s Allegations**: Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to Andrew three times in 2001 (London, Manhattan, and the Virgin Islands). The London incident, linked to the photo, is the most documented. Her accounts are supported by witnesses like Andriano and legal filings unsealed in 2019 and 2024. / []

Wasn't Virginia Giuffre 17 y/o when she was with Prince Andrew? Isn't the age of consent in UK also 16 y/o?  So what is the scandal? / ["If that is the case all people who employ/use prostitutes are guilty of rape.

He never denies anything real. He doesnt actually say "i have never engaged in sexual relations with anyone underage. I would never take advantage of anyone vulnerable, nor would i perform illegal acts whether or not anyone is recording these acts." He denies remembering being in photos and cannot say either way if people are lying about him. There is a lot of bumbling and tripping over statements and at best, he is irresponsible for choosing to stay with a sex offender for the convenience (like he doesnt have an unlimited budget!) At worst he is a sex offender who has connections to have someone suicided. RIP Virginia ❤ / []
its awful that what he was doing with what that purpose in mind but em em em Oh yes but because i hadnt seen him for em that ut ut ut i had to but but but i didnt know and ive never met the lady / []
Nothing wrong with being friends with a sex offender, before he knew he was a sex offender. What an absolute idiot! 🤦‍♀️ / []
This idiot Prince is guilty as hell. Virginia‘s dead man switch also began saying, “everybody gagged at seeing Bill Clinton naked. And Barack Obama didn’t go to the island for the girls. He went for the little boys.” These people all need to go to jail… Deep under jail. They are most disgusting. / []
Trump would kill to be able to lie that well.😊 / ['Lord have mercy sweetheart, Prince Andrew doesn’t fool anybody. He comes off as a disgusting, dirty old man and a disgusting liar. I’d be ashamed to be seen in the same room as him.', 'Prince Andrew fooling you in this interview speaks to your poor judge of character & being easily influenced which explains why your assessment of Trump is also wrong.', '@Caleb_Mandrake872\xa0 Oh, you misunderstand. Prince Andrew is fooling no-one with his squirming excuses, I just think Trump would envy his eloquent command of the English language to camouflage his blatant lies to the poorly educated American electorate.']
when you think about how Harry and his family is treated , the mind boggles . / []
what a WALLY😂😂😂 / []
Andrew constantly said at the start of this interview that Epstein was not a close friend. You don’t fly to a friends house for four days to break off ties with him if he’s not a close friend. That’s all you need to know,he said it himself!!! / ['Lord, he went to Jeffrey’s house, hon, because he was being blackmailed. I think he went creeping there to call off the dogs and get a little girl action. And when I say little, I mean, age wise. This old chap isn’t capable of pleasing a real woman. In fact, he isn’t capable of pleasing anybody.']

Wow, I've just watched this again.  OMG,, is he that stupid? This isn't a car crash interview, it's a pile up. Absolutely awful. I'm surprised he didn't   rehearse the interview first. Every question from Emily, u could see his eyes think what to say next.    RIP VIRGINIA ❤ / []
I'm listening to the song cuz i'm a bad liar goes great with this interview. / []
To think he did not know who John Brokemen was? He was certainly shellshocked when he heard that he was there at the time! / []

He might have fooled his Mother but he does not fool the public in any way. / []

HEARSAY CAN BE VERY DAMAGING FOR ANYONE – NOT LEAST HRH PRINCE ANDREW – BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHERE’S THE PROOF ?  Aside from the accusations - none of which appear to have very much concrete evidence to vouch for their accuracy - I prefer to see HRH Prince Andrew, as one who can live-up to his renowned reputation, as a senior Royal Navy Officer and Combat-Served Helicopter Pilot in the Falklands War !   This is in addition to his exemplary conduct during the entirety of his service in *The Senior Service*; ergo The Royal Navy !   One thing that always strikes me - whenever I see him on video - is the fact that he is almost the living image of the Duke of Edinburgh !   Whatever has recently been said of Prince Andrew's life - during his Epstein years - I don't think any of his critics, in this regard, have as much as attempted to suggest that Prince Andrew participated, at any time, with under-age girls or anything else like that ?  This was not even to go as far as accusing him of being even as a much as a voyeur, when all this suspected hyped-up Hokum was all happening ? / []
So there's a lot of stupidity in the Royal family. / []
Epsteen was setting people up for suppressing them financially. Virginia was 17 years old and knew exactly what she was doing. / []
Super duper CRINGE 🫣 / []
Oh my goodness, I'm halfway into this interview and it's not only cringe but he's a horrible liar. / []
His tendency to be too honorable I almost fell off my chair / ["But he doesn't sweat!", '@shemp815He had a particular medical condition that didn’t allow him to sweat because he was shot at.

So he is saying that he didn’t know that his friend was being investigated for sex trafficking? Are you telling me that the Royals wouldn’t have been told ? So he isn’t disgusted by his friend’s actions and is only concerned about how it looks. It was a convenient place to stay despite being a patron of the NSPCC. He must have been locked in a secret room whilst all the girls were there. / []

Considering Virginia just killed herself, April 2025, over what this monster and Epstein and his so called girlfriend did, i think Andy should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and imprisoned for life, not only for child grape, but for participating in sex trafficking.  After all his mummy has passed, and he's no longer the favorite child.  Imho he's a disgusting monster who's been allowed to get away with this for far to long.  Just watching this interview you can tell he's lying, and he's obviously gotten away with lying his entire life.  Edited to add, please don't forget that his nickname is randy Andy, theres proof behind the nickname. / []
RIP / []
he fiddled some kids 100% / []
Interviewer: “You threw a birthday party for Ghislaine Maxwell at Sandringham” Andrew:😳 “Errr Nooo, it was a shooting weekend. Just a straightforward shooting weekend.” Me in a slow sarcastic voice: “Ohhhhh it was a shooting weekennnnddd… Just a STRAIGHTFORWARD shooting weekend” ohh well that clears that up. They were shooting something alright. Let me guess, shooting loads? Sorry, I meant to say loads of shooting going on… Firing off blanks perhaps? 😂. Just straight and forward shooting. But you didn’t invite Epstein. He just showed up to Windsor Castle with Ghislaine for a weekend of shooting loads. Ooop, Sorry my mistake again - loads of shooting… Just straightforward shooting at underage clay pigeons. / []

Virginia committed suicide this yesterday. 4 weeks ago she was in hospital claiming doctors and told her she had only days to live after a crash involving a a school bus which no one else was injured in while posting doctored photos of herself on her Social media the police did not need to investigate and denied it was serious. Is it possible that she was a fantasist of some kind? Or is it possible that her mental health had declined to where she became a fantasist over the last number of years.Is it possible that she would have had a normal life after Epstein until she went public to the world press leading her into that toxic media circus that destroyed her life? I don't doubt that Andrew had sex with her, that Epstein used her or that her life when young was awful but was she best served by going public to become media fodder for the world in the name of " justice"?  Or was her life worth exposing Andrew and Epstein? Perhaps the world thinks it is?  Perhaps the pay out she got was so large from Andrew that she was ill prepared to deal with 25 million AUS dollars and it destroyed her. These are logical questions for us, for society but a great many people want to be hysterical and never move from " She's a victim".  Well she was, but a great many of the 8 billion people on this planet are in one way or the other so will we start talking about them too at some stage. / []

He went to see Epstein, because he was shitting himself 😱💩 about Epstein spilling the beans about his involvement /complicity with all his his sexual encounters with Virginia and other young girls no doubt. This sweaty, Lardy arse, free loading, arrogant prick needs to be booted out of the Royal Lodge, along with his vile ex wife Fergie, who’s another free loader.😡🤬😤😤🤯🤯 / []
I want to know what happened to the journalist Emily Maitliss, the ‘cringe’ factor is ‘off the scale’ with Prince Andrew’s replies. / []

ANDREW has been SPOILT by the HIS ROYAL FAMILY and now he thinks he is ENTITLED without MUCH EFFORT on HIS PART!!!! / []
Shame on the disgusting prick, how dare you / []
The overexplaining is so telling! I am in awe at 99.9% of everything that came out of his mouth! The lack of insight and self-awareness is stunning!!😮 / []
What man flies to see another man just to say we can’t be friends anymore??  I feel it’s apparent he is lying throughout this entire interview! 😠🤢 / []
the predictability of stupidity / []
He is the worst liar I have ever encountered. / []
So refreshing to hear the real truth from a honest n down to earth 🌎 chap. / []

An embarrassing member of the monarchy again fgs / []
The man is a liar / []
I dont know a single British person who didnt want to kick him into the north sea after watching this... / []
When listening to both testimonies - Virginia's & Andrew's, even not knowing Virginia personally, I believe her that she was abused by this pervert. She mentions specifics and her given statement as well as body language says she is clearly remembering these awful events from that particular night - there is so much pain, whereas Andrew's entire body language says he is effing lying... Besides, seeing Andrew's bedroom in the Buckingham Palace with all the dolls on the bed, I would say, there is something wrong with him - that f***ing creep.

Just so weird that BBC have this interwiew, when all he says is rubbish and lies. / []
I come back here to laugh at him now and again 😂 / []

He lies to the interviewer like we're medieval peasants that will just soak up all the Prince's "truths." / []
The rabbit hole of this, Jimmy Saville, Marc Du Trou. All these rings mixing. It’s insane / []
On January 3, 2015, at 5:50 a.m., Andrew fired off an email to Maxwell. This was just hours after Virginia Giuffre filed court papers in Florida claiming she’d been abused by him as part of Jeffrey Epstein’s trafficking ring. In the email, Andrew wrote, “Let me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.” Maxwell hit back quick, saying, “Have some info. Call me when you have a moment.” That’s the raw exchange—short, sharp, and loaded. “Virginia Roberts” is Giuffre’s maiden name, so it’s crystal clear who they’re talking about.  This email’s a big deal because it directly contradicts Andrew’s big BBC Newsnight interview where he claimed he didn’t recall ever meeting Giuffre. If he’s emailing Maxwell about her in 2015, it’s a stretch to say she’s a total stranger to him, right? The timing’s brutal too—Giuffre’s legal move had just dropped, so Andrew’s clearly rattled, digging for dirt or some kind of heads-up from Maxwell. Panorama also got their hands on a follow-up from Maxwell three days later, where she sent Andrew a “dossier of inconsistencies and inaccuracies” about Giuffre’s story. Sounds like a defense playbook, but it didn’t call the famous photo of Andrew with Giuffre fake—something his camp later leaned on hard.  These emails were buried in a mountain of legal docs from Giuffre’s defamation suit against Maxwell, which settled in 2017. They only popped out when the BBC started digging. In a 2016 deposition tied to that case, Maxwell got grilled about the email. She played it vague, saying she didn’t recall the specifics of their chat, just that they agreed Giuffre was “a liar.” She didn’t elaborate on why Andrew thought that or what “info” she had, but it’s sketchy as hell—two people neck-deep in Epstein’s world, scrambling to sync up their stories.  Andrew is a straight-up clown, and the dirt on him piles up like trash on a city corner. His former bodyguards, the folks who had to trail this royal disaster, ain’t got a single good word to say about him. Word is, he treated them—and pretty much everyone—like they were beneath him, like he was some untouchable kingpin. I’ll break it down with the real talk and some examples.   First off, his ex-bodyguards have spilled some tea over the years. These guys weren’t just clocking in for a paycheck—they had to deal with Andrew’s arrogance 24/7. One story floating around from palace insiders says he’d bark orders at them like they were dogs, expecting them to jump at his every whim, no matter how petty. Think stuff like screaming at them to fetch random crap or losing it if they didn’t salute fast enough. Another time, a guard supposedly got chewed out for not opening a gate quick enough at one of his fancy pads—Andrew allegedly called him “useless” and told him to “get a real job.” (Coming from him is laughable) That’s the vibe—pure entitlement, treating people like they’re dirt under his polished shoes. When he got angry some witnessed him kicking the queens dogs out of frustration. Sad to think her dogs are with this monster now.   Then there’s the Fergie situation—Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife. People who’ve been around them say Andrew didn’t hold back on his ex, Insiders have claimed he’d hurl insults at her like it was nothing, calling her stuff like “fat cow” or “slob” in front of staff, just to flex his cruelty. One report from a former aide said they heard him tell Fergie she was “an embarrassment” and “good for nothing” during a blowout fight—publicly humiliating her like it was sport. This wasn’t some private spat either; he’d do it where people could hear, showing off that nasty streak. Monster indeed —he’s got a rep for being a bully with zero chill.  Now, let’s get to the grimy stuff. That woman who said Andrew grabbed her breasts? That’s Johanna Sjoberg, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. She dropped this bomb in court docs, saying back in 2001, when she was 21, Andrew got handsy at Epstein’s New York mansion. Picture this: they’re posing for a photo with a Spitting Image puppet of Andrew—already weird as hell—and she says he used the puppet’s hand to touch Virginia Giuffre’s chest while he straight-up grabbed hers with his own. She called it a “joke” they all laughed at, but it’s creepy as hell, especially knowing Epstein’s MO. Andrew’s team says it’s “categorically untrue,” but Sjoberg’s story lines up with the pattern of him being way too comfortable in Epstein’s sleazy world.  Speaking of Epstein, that foot massage tale from John Brockman? Straight-up chilling. Brockman, a big-shot literary agent, wrote about chilling at Epstein’s place in 2010 and seeing “Andy” getting his feet rubbed by two young Russian girls. He didn’t clock it was Prince Andrew at first, but when he did, it hit him—this royal dude was deep in Epstein’s orbit. If you know the Epstein case, those “massages” were the gateway to way worse. Virginia Giuffre’s said that’s how it started for her too—massages turning into abuse. Brockman’s email paints Andrew as just another creep lounging in that predator’s den, no questions asked.  Andrew’s excuses are a joke too. That “I can’t sweat” line from his BBC Newsnight interview? He said he couldn’t have been sweaty dancing with Giuffre at Tramp nightclub in 2001 ‘cause he had some Falklands War condition. Bro, the internet roasted him—people dug up pics of him dripping sweat at events, like one from 2001 at a polo match, looking like he just ran a marathon. Then he claimed he didn’t even know where the bar was at Tramp, like he’s never been. Cue more pics—him at Tramp, drink in hand, posted all over X and tabloids. Man’s a liar, and not even a good one.  That interview was a car crash. No empathy, no remorse—just a narcissist fumbling to save his ass. He called Epstein’s behavior “unbecoming” like it was a mild faux pas, not a sex trafficking nightmare. Said he stayed at Epstein’s crib in 2010 ‘cause it was “convenient,” then admitted it was a dumb move but didn’t give a damn about the victims. People on X and everywhere else were like, “This guy’s a sociopath.” The FBI’s been itching to grill him since at least 2020—US Attorney Geoffrey Berman called him out for giving “zero cooperation” despite Andrew promising on TV he’d help. If he’s so innocent, why’s he dodging them like a fugitive? Smells like guilt from a mile away.  More dirt? Virginia Giuffre’s the main accuser, saying Andrew assaulted her three times when she was 17—once at Maxwell’s, once at Epstein’s New York spot, and once on his private island. She’s got that famous pic with his arm around her, Maxwell grinning in the background. Andrew says it’s fake, but he settled with her in 2022 for millions—why pay if you’re clean? Then there’s Shukri Walker, a witness who swears she saw him at Tramp with Giuffre, even stepped on his foot and apologized. Andrew’s alibi? He was at Pizza Express in Woking with his kid. Nobody buys that—Beatrice doesn’t even remember it.  Prison? Hell yeah, he deserves it. The dude’s a disgrace—arrogant, abusive, and tied to one of the ugliest scandals ever. Bodyguards hate him, Fergie’s been trashed by him, and the Epstein stink won’t wash off. He’s a narcissistic mess who thinks he’s above it all, but the streets see through that royal bs. However, sycophants and throne sniffers like Neil Sean prefer to die on the hill of sleaze with Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell. It’s enough to turn your stomach. I prefer to die on the hill with innocent children who were troubled and taken advantage of, preyed upon by wealthy scumbags who think they’re untouchable. Every dog has its day. / ['This is the biggest comment I’ve ever seen.', 'I understand the idea of a woman hired to look after the house then being tricked/forced into something.

When I'm feeling down in life I look at this interview for laughs 😂 / []
This clip came up in my feed after having watched an interview of one of the royal bodyguards. He had kind words for everyone of the royal family, except for Andrew. Apparently he was a total dick to everybody. / []
Pants on fire / []
🍯🥃✋✋😎❤😂🎉 / []
He said he didnt know the club but then he didnt go there often if he did 😂😂😂 / []
When Prince Andrew come out the Navy he was the No#1 bachelor everyone loved him and now he's despised by a huge majority of the British public, there's pictures of  Andrew at a nightclub partying and theres a picture of him with sweat patches in his armpits after he got out the Navy fact. / []
Oh my god he's such a lier tripping over himself, this is comedy gold, his poor mother must have been so ashamed / []
It's been said that he's not a very smart person, and this shows it. He should NEVER have denied meeting and sleeping with Virginia because he obviously did. He should have admitted it. All he had to say was he simply didn't know how old she was. She can easily pass for 20/21. Now if she thought she could trust Andrew, did she at any point ask for help? Did she ever appear distressed? Troubled? Upset? Quiet? Was she dirty? Seem malnourished? Because she's smiling in that picture, is very clean, healthy and seems very comfortable. If he saw any of those signs and NOT doing anything would make him complicit and guilty. Added she was 17. She was NOT a child. Legal consensual sex in NY is 16. So that throws that argument right out the window. Now the friendship is another story. As soon as he found out about Jeffrey even being charged with sex trafficking, he should have ended the relationship immediately. No need to travel 10 hours to end a friendship under these types of allegations. A quick phone call and conversation would have been enough to end it. For normal people anyway. He should have booked a room at a hotel beforehand and made sure the press knew WHY he was there. He admits that Jeffrey came to Beatrice,s birthday party  because he invited Gislaine and they apparently only came anywhere as a couple. In that case, I'd have ended my friendship with Gislaine because she obviously supports Jeffrey. This is common sense. He really screwed and embarrassed himself and the RF. / []
The only possible explanation I can think of as to why the BBC hasn't disabled comments is that they are taunting us, more or less asking, what are you gonna do about it? / []
This interview cost Queeny 15 million US. If you are innocent, then you don't cave. You fight to the end. You DONT pay your accuser to "go away". Why would you? / []
A doorways a convenient place to stay,a hotels is quiet convenient place , a pedos house is not a convenient place?. Sorry Andrew your dug yourself a hold here you dick / []
Bet you are sweating now, Andy !   Like a rapist. 😮😅😂 / []
It's a great fishing day for you here today in Grand Cayman  well early on because it's a bit windy I don't know you probably deep sea  A fish is very expensive here❤😂🎉 / []
I was abused by someone and when confronted, watched them categorically deny the entire thing to my face in front of a group of people. It was traumatic. I can’t imagine what the victim must have felt watching this man bald-faced lie about her experience on an international broadcast. Sick / []
a child sex offender who has not been brought to justice / []
Probably the best interview he has ever done he destroyed himself over night  haha haha big time hilarious / []
He is talking himself into a hole. He couldnt afford to stay in a hotel, thats why he stayed with epSTEIN. / []
It surprises me that he was his mother’s favourite and Edward wasn’t.   Edward was the only one out of her children to not be in the headlines for anything scandalous / ['Andrew was the most handsome', 'I think he was the youngest. Sometimes the baby is favored.', '@wellfedosfedHe’s not the youngest, Edward is the youngest. Andrew is second youngest.', '\u200b@aroosajkhan okay thank you my mistake. In that case, i too have no idea why the queen mother coddled him', '@blanchequizno7306 He was—until he destroyed everything. Once someone’s darkness is exposed, it changes how you see them forever.']
"it was a convention place to stay" wtf / []
He looks really guilty / []
NOT A PET JUST NEED A FKN TRAM / []
Its a train wreck from start to finish.  Unbelievable in every way 😮😅 / []
His PR team is still trying to manage the fallout from his story breaking down in front of the world's media. The world sees the sweaty fiddler for who he is / []
1:19  What Andrew is really saying is that Epstein had an extraordinary ability to bring underage girls and rich horny men together.   https://youtu.be/MPlh6jLtbFI / []
He must drop the Prince off of his name! She was so cool to say,  "it might seem like a funny way to break off a friendship..." 😂😂😂 She slow cooked him fo'shyo! Uffff lady! Simply amazing 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
I wonder how he felt after walking out of this catastrophe / ['Apparently he and his advisors in very high spirits, exemplifying his disconnection from reality. Surprisingly, the team behind the interview were in shock about what they’d just seen and heard. As we all were.', "@alexcone7368 what utterly disturbed me recently, was those close to Andrew, not only DEFENDING HIM, but also saying Virginia Roberts got 'KARMA' for telling her experience! What kind of vile sick shit is that"]
Got quite a bit of stuttering going on in this interview I don't think I believe him / ['Way to go Sherlock.']
Watching this back 5 years later, his answers are just bizarre. When someone asks if you regret meeting a convicted paedophile and you say no because of all the people you met and the opportunities to learn were very useful.....it says everything, he literally see's nothing wrong with the friendship and what he got out of it / ["It's seriously bizarre. I mean, even if that's sincerely what you think, that you're glad you got to meet different people - why the hell would you say that in an interview when you're implicated in sex trafficking? The lack of awareness is shocking,how can you not know how that would be perceived? Not even take legal advice?!!", "It's like someone saying they only joined the KKK because they loved the family-friendly bbqs in the summer."]
Degenerate liberals, middle class Royals / []
I have watched this several times and i think Prince Andrew is a terrible liar. Nobody can believe him after watching this / []
im surprised this hasnt been took down yet / []
Please stop lies after lies after lies opportunity 2 go 2 American you had a opportunity 2 have six with a young girl you engaged rightly business opportunity what business opportunities did you bring into Britain NONE stop telling lies you are making a fool out of yourself Maxwell was a very dangerous powerful woman is lured young girls no contact with him but yes you did a soul purpose my backside you Prince Andrew where in the mix of it all don't believe word of it that comes out of your own mouth party to celebrate and you where at it and you stayed at that home no matter what your judgement you were so wrong on your own judgement end of foot massage from a young Russian o yes you did when the daily mail got wind off it guilty has sin he took his own life guilty has sin Maxwell guilty has sin / []
Just got news of Virginia Guiffre being hit by a bus going 110kms/hr. Accident? I highly doubt it. Blood on royal hands. / []

I wonder if Prince Andrew was drugged / []
In all honestly, because he was a "friend" of this Epstien people can say what ever they want about prince Andrew. I'd like to believe him but, after hearing this all telling interview, 😮😮😮😮😮 / []
There is a picture of Andrew with his arm around a very young girl / []
Pack of lies Andrew / []
It’s absurd how blatantly obvious it is that he’s bullshitting and making things up as he goes 😂 This interview genuinely seems like something out of a tv show or something. Crazy that this is a real interview, and he actually thinks he’s making any kind of sense with his excuses lol. / []
Train wreck / []
"I went to tell him in person that we couldn't be seen in public together" – sooo stupid. So the issue wasn't what they were up to, but not to be seen? / []
This chump is a terrible liar!!! He never should have done interview. / []
It's a harness opinion on this one I do I'm not a fan of England prime minister at the moment I saw him in my dream and there's a. I don't have to go any further with it and I hate no one and and then if they want to take Andrew with him they all can go I don't have a problem with that either❤🎉💚💛💚 / []
AND THEN THE PANDEMIC HAPPENED... / []
Andrew is a very poor liar / []
God he is a disgrace! What sane man has 72 teddy bears on his bed. He has been described as a bully, rude & privileged by his police guards / []
Same hands as His Father, will Dig his own...and so will the rest. Even the Royal's are Corrupt what a shock ! ;) Didn't Sweat at the time,,,bet you all are now tho.. this Lady is Class ...Knows Exactly what she's doing. Guilty as Sin. / []
His Teddy Bears have to be arranged on his bed in a certain configuration or his servants are chastised. Worth reflecting on? / []
Meant asalted / []
Liar liar liar you knew what eas going on / []
Andrew is a nice liar since the queen passed no one likes him rude to staff had an afIr with Maxwell he knew what was going on  guilty as hell  believe  the girl he adapted queen payed out hush money Andre should of stuck with Sara they were well suited togethet he is a ruined man  now once very well liked he is now hated. / []

10:20 Freudian slip?! 😂 / []
What a shameless peadoohile he is. Lies lies and more lies / []
Isn’t the legal age 16 and the girl was 17? / ['Yes it is but obviously it’s dubious at best if one individual is under 18 and the other is well over', "It varies by state. In Florida where the picture was taken the AOC is 18. \nIn my opinion it should be 18 nationwide. Pretty gross a group of 60+ yr old men decided 16 was the legal age. Can't even buy nicotine at that age."]
Where’s all the comments for the grooming gangs who are still raping young girls to this day / ["Because this isn't a gang, its a worldwide network"]
He had police protection at the time. Scotland Yard knows exactly where he has been but obviously not coming forward with any information. / ['Same as the grooming gangs who are getting away with it until this day']
He looks so much like HMTLQ. She must have been heartbroken. / ['I like to think (and I think it may be true) that he only did this interview because she made him. RIP, she was a true icon', '\u200b@rawntech_7820 I read that it was upon the advice of his daughters that he took on the interview. HLM must have approved it since it was filmed at BP.']
And his f friend Courtney Love lol / []
Ahhh the BBC... glad to expose him for publicity, the same BBC who gladly endorsed countless known paedophiles/abusers for decades for their own gains too. Prince Andrew and the BBC are very alike. / ['100% \nAt least this interviewer seems stellar']
Prince walley / []
So why haven’t newsnight acquired evidence from his security/bodyguards on his whereabouts in order to substantiate his denials? Only asking! / []
Idiot / []
The Ghislaine Maxwell association is even worse than the Epstein one. Ghislaine and her father Robert were spying for Israel by using the UK so the British gov't and the royal family would have known about it. This affair is even worse. / []

What's relevent is he keeps trying to deflect his relationship onto it being about Ghislaine when, she's in prison for sex trafficking and suspescted of having a massive lart to play in Epstein's activities. / ['Exactly!']
I remember watching this and not believing that it was real. Uhm.... nothings changed.  It's like watching a sketch/comedy. But.... supposedly it isn't. / []
What a bad liar. Committing these horrible and shameful crimes are one thing and being so incompetent to not even make a lie look like a lie is not worth screen time on my phone. Learn from CNN and BBC on making a lie look like a reality. / []

I come back here every other year 😁 / []
They were such good friends but he never saw her entire home? He was never upstairs where the kitchen was? Thats just strange. I dunno. I love my house. I want my friends to see it. Who doesn't show off their house? Esp for a close friend. SO many holes in his story. I'm glad HM the Queen didn't watch this. She refused. Or so it's been said. / []

So he needs to justify himself to Jeff why they need to breakup?  As if he cannot figures it out himself.  Guilty. Jeff has dirt on him for sure. / []
Railway station is a code word for a ...... / []
Best parts at 13:42…he’s in shock lol / []
He thought he was smart, how TERRIBLE! Because he was spotted🌝 / []
He is not a friend, but I have to do it in person because I am not a chicken. / []
Could it be. / []

Give me a break, not breaking up with a friend over the phone excuse, at that point if you can’t figure out he’s lying just take his word! / []
Not very bright is he 🤦🏼‍♀️ / []
Of course he had the ability to bring extra-ordinary people together. When the common bait is intercourse that too with those underage, it would fulfill the fetish of many of the rich and elite. / []
What's really worrying is that he thought it went well...😮 shows how far from reality he is / []
24:32 He slips up right here.  He said “I don’t remember going upstairs in the house, because that photograph was taken upstairs.”  He said THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN UPSTAIRS, confirming the legitimacy of the photograph.  And if he never went upstairs, how does he know that’s the upstairs of the house? He’s never seen it, but he recognizes it in a photograph?? / ['Wow good catch', "Beautiful remark.he should have said I know nothing instead of finding arguments to justify  the whole situation.I have noticed that too that's why I like your comment", "Umm actually you can make out that it's upstairs from the photo. Not that it matters, this guy is guilty as hell."]
No no i wasn't having a foot massage, it was my c*ck / []
"Do you regret your whole friendship with him"? Still not, because the people I met and the opportunities 🤣 SERIOUSlY!! / []
32:00 you would certainly know if you had sex with someone, unless you are having a lot of sex, either way he does not make himself sound any less guilty here, what is all this "I racked my brain but I cant remember anything" as if he should have to actually sit there think about if he did or didn't have sex with her, this guys should be in prison. / []
5:59 essentially just implies that (if he knew, which he definitely did) he could have also been informing Epstein about how that organization moves and also manipulating that organization to not look into Epstein if they ever had any suspicion and or making sure their never was any suspicion to begin with. / []
I just watched a movie on Netflix based on this and I had to come and find the interview. It's 2025. / []

Love 😘 of my lifetime in😂❤🎉🌹🐧💯💚💛🖤💝 waiting / []
Funny thing is....I don't believe he is lying...I honestly feel he is/was just *oblivious* to how it all looks & because he didnt do anything *(in his mind)* other then spend time with freinds...  In other words.... *of all the celebs who went to Epsteins Island... he was the only one STUPID enough not to realize once the TRUTH about Epstein came out ...he needed to cover his butt and duck & cover*  Did he party with an underage young girl...yeah probly...I remember *DISCO* ...NOTHING was off the table.  Edit: p.s..The truth IMO he is not a bad man....just  NAIVE....I think he was played & left unprotected. / ['He looks reslly guilty, why would he have his arm around the waist of an underage girl']
£12m pay-off.  This should have resulted in a criminal conviction. I pity the young victims. / []
Funnily enough I was having pizza when I saw this interview 4 years ago / []
This guy is like 10lbs of 💩 in a 5lbs bag / []
They should just get his security staff under cross examination. I’m pretty sure they would have seen everything that actually happened   It’s hard to buy that people like him with security detail in toe and unlimited funds need to stay on a friends couch overnight instead of getting chauffeured home with his security staff / []
I wish she could’ve interviewed Donald Trump and Bill Clinton as well. Insane to me that people still believe that one of them is better than the other. They are both despicable, evil pedos who are on THE list and their families are besties. Bill Clinton got with Monica Lewinsky when she was 21 years old. She was “legal,” but relatively a baby: He was the president and that is sick!  That’s why I don’t do political paradigms anymore. They’re ALL despicable/deplorable!!!! / []
Jillian Anderson and the actor who played PA were PHENOMENAL in the movie adaptation!   Unreal that PA thought this would vindicate him. So entitled. / []
Dirty disgusting pedophile. BBC cover up like they did with Saville and his dad 😮 / []
I love the "Freudian Slip", "What I, I mean what he was doing". / []
My God he is guilty. He’s trying to convince the public and treat the public like idiots. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. He only went to do that interview to make us all look like idiot so he ended up being the idiot a lying idiot / []
The sacrificial lamb to hide the globalist wolves. / []
This guy can make OJ Simpson look likes hes not guilty 😂 thee only recollection he has is being with minors / []
“He didn’t go into any great depth in the conversation of what I- what HE was doing.” 😎😅 / []
Andrew admitted to staying at Epstein's house but insisted he never went upstairs, was he then sleeping downstairs in the dining room? 🤣 "It was a convenient place to stay," he said. 😂With access to unlimited funds and the world’s most luxurious hotels at his disposal, he somehow chose to crash for free in Epstein's home. 🤣 / ['Exactly 😂']
Blimey. What a dink. / []
Can’t have been me because I didn’t sweat back then! 😅😂 / []
Says "yes" shakes his head no. Body language doesnt lie pet. / []
What a terrible liar he is ... Its so obvious and this interviewer is genius. / ["She's probably the best interviewer ive seen"]
7:33 how do you "solicit a minor" for "prostitution"??? That's called rape! Why are they playing with words!? / []
2:05 he's giving us a peek into Epstein's client list / []
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW IT WAS UPSTAIRS IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN UPSTAIRS LOL what an IDIOT LOL!!!!! / []
How would you know it was upstairs....if you claim to have never been upstairs...... / []
Bad timing, the revelations have proved devistating for the entire Royalty, the  Queen was devistated on hearing it from her eldest son, consideration should have been given to he R-family’s  reaction to its publication! / []
IF.... "I absolutely categorically have 🙅🏼NO RECOLLECTION of this girl or THAT pic...🤥🤥🤥👀 So that's my story and I'm STICKING TO IT"... WAS A  PERSON!!!🤷🏼‍♂️🥱 / []
Ok one would say as a  FORMER liar...I can "ABSOLUTELY CATEGORICALLY" tell you, w/good RECOLLECTION  THAT------>HE'S FKG LYING‼️🤦🏽‍♀️🤭  Clues: tells long explicit stories but never answers questions except   Denies EVERY date but gave no RECOLLECTION of nothing sexual explicit?!   As if it would be absolutely PREPOSTEROUS for him to have his hand on a underage girls' waist or that THEY ALL wound be alive young girls, like most old men don't wanna have young girls around?! 💁🏽  🙄 you can't make this stuff up..I swear 🤣🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♀️ / []

Ok folks, somebody go to 21:48 secs.  First, he had an excuse or either..he had "absolutely NO RECOLLECTION" for EVERYTHING🙄   But at 21:48ish secs..he muttered (like in visual memory) "SHE WAS"..🤔then continued the LIE about his sweating?!💁🏽   To which he conveniently had a medical EXCUSE of not being able to sweat on THAT DATE...while he was at the EXPRESS PIZZA YET he remembered THAT though like🤦🏽‍♀️ boy byeeee🫸🏽🥱🥱 / []

On the one hand he says “I didn’t go looking for that sort of thing, I didn’t see anything” (trying to distance himself from it). Then he says “I was the patron of the such and such campaign so I would have noticed it”. If he was so clued up on noticing exploitation, how could he have missed what everyone else saw?  Then he says he wasn’t looking for it. So either he was looking for it, or he wasn’t. He contradicts himself too many times to count! / []
One thing about them YT boys, when one of them caught for their crimes, his "friends" will UNFRIEND each other, LIE n DENY their friendships, pics and videos with them in 1.2 seconds🤭🤭  They be like...."Well weren't REALLY friends"...  Meanwhile, he was the GUEST OF HONOR at his welcome home from prison party if A CONVICTED PETTYFILE⁉️ Oh but he stayed THE NIGHT bc "ah..it was ah..ah convenient but I wasn't a party to any of the girls RUNNING IN N OUT OF THE HOUSE!!   BULL SHXT, forever princess Diana BEEN told us the horrors of that NOT SO Royal family. She knew the truth which is why THEY KILLED HER TF 🤨🙄🤨 / []
Nothing seemed off bc HE WAS DOING THE SAME SHXT‼️🤷🏽‍♀️ When you're friends doing the same shit, why would he hide what he's doing?  I call BULL SHXTTTTTT✋🏽🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 / []

Who takes a 5 hour flight/10 hours of travel to end a friendship with a pedophile? And then stay for 3 days in said pedophiles home. It doesnt add up. Why make the trip? I can assume that he was told NOT to make the trip by the palace, but he did it anyway. Why? / ['Exactly 💯 maybe Jeffery was the only person Andrew knew how to get underage girls from']
This man can lie , His mother knew he was a liar  and he may be jailed that was why the  innocent woman had to pay that huge money  . Andrew can never confess in many years to come . / []
What a whimsical way of digging your own grave. / []
Interviewer wasn't strong enough. She allowed him to deflect too many times without stopping him and asking him to answer the question asked. Stuttering like fuck btw. / ['I think she did a great job, he exposed himself']
Time heals all wounds?  Today 2025, I say, but what about the others?  Trumpo Bozo are you there? and, yes, what about Clinton?...well that too, and Dershowitz, who talks about it!! (of course, he doesn't remember himself!! someone please cut the rest of his...)and, Gates? Gates? and so so many others. / []
He's such a good guy. If you speed on the road you'll be charged for it, but he can rape, no problem because he has power. What's the point of the law? I don't understand. / []
Prince andrew saying i let the side down. Talking like he just got a red card. He really trys to play everything down and he never addresses anything directly he seems to distance himself from it all. This guy is so delusional.  This guy is a royal family member and he is quite clearly just as bad and guilty as Epstein. Just let that sink in. / []
????????????????????????????????? / []
I have to say, he's got a lovely voice / []
Andrew isn't Donald... only truly gifted liars can pull this sort of interview off. / []
I think he's telling the truth / ['😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🫵🏻']
Mumsy dearest paid off his victim  Good old mumsy Betty / []
Rino skin Dementia memory Unbecoming demeanor😊 / []
“The fact of the fatter”? / []
He’s interested in learning about international trade but doesn’t know what’s happening in the United States 🇺🇸 and doesn’t have a team of experts who do just that??? / []
Why give her a pay out if ya not guilty / []
What id like to know is that if this girl KNEW what was going on, then why did she hang around?  She obviously had to know. No one is that dim. She wasn't held prisoner so why not run to a police precinct and report it?  But no. She hung around and did what she did willingly. That was an easy money grab. / ["She was young and groomed, underage, you can't blame her"]
There's nothing wrong with liking younger women. All he had to say was that yes, they met, and they had sex but he didn't know how old she was. That he was told she was 20.  And it could very well be true but this interview totally shows what a liar he is bringing the whole thing crashing down on top of him. / []
This perverted child-molesting dork is such an embarassment for the UK. / []
"Um..."  "My tendency to be too honorable."  He is American white trash from Florida that happens to use, for the most part, proper grammar. What a vile person. / []
using your place in life to use people not so powerful as you how despicable is that and beable to smile slime leaves a trail look behind him and the rest new and did nothing / []
When he’s lying he doesn’t move his hands and when he’s telling the truth he can’t stop moving his hands. He also says “ I can’t remember, I have no recollection “ This from a guy that doesn’t drink alcohol.  Last one……. It’s impossible for me to sweat. Guilty as fk. / []
4:14 he needed Geoffrey Epstein to teach him about business... You couldn't make it up 😂 / []
A Rock Bottom feeder / []
this interview was hilarious especially after being stoned / ['I hear ya 😂', '😂😂😂😂😂', "He don't sweat 😂😂😂 \nI'm telling the judge that 😂😂😂", '😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅']
Why are these sick parasites still in our employ? What do they actually do besides abusing teenagers girls? / []
Prince Andrew should sue Boise & the women who voluntarily engaged in sexual activity with him. “I was abused by him”. lol. This is extortion. / []
Nobody believes this / []
Apparently, this clown has the worst memory of any human being on earth. / []
After just watch Epstein documentary I don’t know what’s more disturbing this rat. Or the palace issues a statement he had no envolement / []
Love how every 3rd word is stuttered / []
Guilty / []
Watched this with my 1 year old nephew. His first word was "liar". / []
If anyone wants to study psychology and body language this guys the poster boy for it 😅😅 / []
Lmfao this guy's excuses I had a medical condition where I couldn't sweat 😅😅😅😅😅 / []
He didn't know where the bar was in Tramp. Did he really say that? 😵‍💫 / []
“Epstein is dead”, he laughs! 😂 / []
For someone who wasn’t a good friend he went to a lot of trouble to end their friendship and at great risk to himself. Doesn’t really make sense. / ['Exactly, Andrew mustve been trying to plea a deal with Jeffrey to be quiet']
Here again due to Scoop! / []
This is the most underrated interview ever. 😂 / []
Ha! He discribes Epstein's house like a "railway station". Almost like a place where humans are trafficked through... 5 years on and this interview never gets old 😂😂 / ['yes with Epstein "popping in and out all over the place"', "He incriminates himself and many others within the first minutes 😂😂. I'm surprised that I had never really sat and watched this before it's absolute cinema"]
LMFAO, what a clown. This no-gooder nobody thinks he's fooling people with all the "you sees" and "keep in minds". It's always the dumbest idiots that think themselves the smartest and they always think they're fooling everybody / []
You can tell he os lying / []
Lyer lier / []
Suitable  chanmel pedos / []
I’m not going to gossip about it because a thing about him what he could of what couldn’t do that’s not my problem is that clear enough. / []
you’re moronic if you think royal families give a sht about you or don’t lie. / []
He even fails to speak the Kings English...even here...his very expensive education...seemingly...is a total write off.  Such a miserable lowly Cad / []
Needs  He even fails to speak the "Kings" English...at a time like this...his expensive education is a write off. / []
Hi demise is taking to long...a lingering human wart / []
You can tell by his eyes he’s lying / []
I am addicted to this. / []
Isn't the president of the U.S a convicted sex offender? / []
I dislike this boy / []
He was to busy abusing girls to notice "What was going on" / []
Lots of stuttering for a beach party / []
His Royal Something scuttling for cover like a cockroach ..when the light is shined / []
That was like a monty python skit.  What idiot told him to do that interview?  Winston Churchill is probably looking down on this guy and wishing he had t saved the crown.  lol / []
agreeing to this interview was another REALLY BAD  DESICION lol / []
I can't believe the accuracy in which Michael Sheen managed to capture the essence of this royal moron in A Very Royal Scandal. I strongly recommend watching it, because it shows you how sickly immoral this guy really is, to the point that he is flabbergasted when being told he's being accused of battery; he didn't even comprehend the concept of what he did to the girl, and shows absolutely no remorse, or empathy towards Epstein's victims. / []
The next Generation s are going to think we're a joke and they're lucky it wasn't them / []
Just have no faith in law when this man can still walk free with absolute flawless evidence, doesn't USA have an extradition treaty with SHIT Britain / []
a reportaje with ms maxwell the answer will be coming nearer???? Prince is stummering / []
The abomination of selective breeding / []
When you’re backed into a corner / []
Thank you very much indeed! / []
The instant giveaway that the handlers had abandoned him… his tie askew. / []
What's with these spares. Are they all stupid and wild!!! / []
Nov 2019.. TAKE ME BACK PLS 😢 / []
Why did he pay her off? The full truth would have come out so they paid her to stay silent. / []
What a pompous idiot! Made himself look even more rediculous. / []
Mossad operation / []
The sickening thing is Epstein was being investigated in 2006 and still got away with it for a long time after that. And he probably had to go in person because all his calls are recorded. The walk in the park looks shifty af. / []
This guy is so delusional he reallyhas never been held accountable been given everything in a silver platter has no morals he prob thinks people buy his bull crap doesn’t realize he looks like a total lunatic his such a psycho complete embarrassment to the great people of London how he hasn’t been forced to step down says a lot of the people that rule over there the same people that killed princess Diana endorsed this monster no surprise there smh 🤦‍♂️ / []

Lotta dodgy shit going on in the world folks / []
11:18 pretty mad how he thinks this would fool the public, i suppose he was right for the majority but wow. / []
He had an extraordinary abilitlity to gather pedophiles. / []
“Rrrrrrrrr?!!!” / []
“…uhrmmmm, afraid about the walk in the park…Epstine the walk in the Park,never happened!!””😀😀😀 / []
Every tell tale sign of deception and lies hes portraying, unreal this is the family were forced to give money too every year 🙄 fuk my life / []
Thanks, Sammy / []
this video really is the gift that keeps giving. this is my favourite quote, although of course there are many to chose from: "my judgement was coloured by my tendency to be too honourable" / []
Most amazingly, he states that he doesn't regret the relationship because he had so many opportunities to learn.  Wow! / []
You only have one black pair of shoes 👟  And it's Clarks summit  And every time you worried about shoes 👟 it's is described as a brown shoes and it's a black shoes  It's the same shoes every time for 5 years  Daddy's whole life the media is and stupid 🥃 personal they don't know when what time and where it is exposed that the Thai world you cannot have them take over it's f****** this international disaster  The Chinese are poisonous with the food  Can you imagine the Indians take off your doctors for life and controlling everything  Jimmy no more black people at / []
Happy 😁 according birthday 🎉🌹😎 coming ❤😂😂 / []
He likes to bring up his military service as much as possible, thinking it will help improve his image. It didn't! / ['Nothing will improve his image, even if he found a cure for cancer.']
This interview should be sited for a new term name of: Ego-Blind / []
A horrible elitest who has not grasped the reality that he has no right to feel beyond critisism and the public hold no respect and will hold him accountable. He associates with people that can pay his tab because he contributes absolutely nothing and is a poster boy for using status as an income. He has no interest in anyone apart from himself and like a typical bully, treats people in employment like dirt beneath his feet and shows no respect or appreciation. A vile sponger. / []
Only if he had a decent lawyer to prep him properly / []
‘I don’t sweat.’ 😂 / []
You wanted to know if there was anything that would link you to sleeping with underage women / []
You were close friends don’t lie you was on the boat logs and island logs at his house lier lier now you going to start ww3 with china your dangerous you even invited him to your house the cottage to have afternoon tea with the queen / []
Why, in 2025, still exists something like a family sustained by the people of a country (countries on this case) to do nothing but take pictures and have etiquette lessons?? / []
Wxnker / []
A decrepit boy / []
What a disgustingly self serving man! He must be deluded to think people will believe his obvious lies. / []
What a crazy protected man. Your mate died and you laughed. Your such a prick / []
Easiest solution to this problem: publish the security details logs of the night he was at Pizza a Express. They keep gps records 24/7.   ... / []
What you have to remember  is the queen is watching this nonsense. / []
He can remember being at a pizza place several years ago, but cant recall if he had sex with a minor or not. / []
45:15 sounds like he got away with pretty much in the past. / []
Keeps glancing left ,when hes preesed  on  basicallywhen he's lying well trying ..body language !!! / []
What an absolute bollix / []
The yellow king / []
They should leave Andrew alone now,it's played out, I say good on you Andrew if you can pull pretty girls, we all like and look at tender birds.Andrew was  ok when I meet him / []
Pig / []
What a honest man! / []
This guy reminds me of Adam Schiff / []
If he is sure the photo was taken upstairs how would he know what the upstairs looks like if he said he’d never been up there? 🤯 / []
He said "its difficult to prove it" thats some Courtney Love shit 😮 "i did it, nobody can prove it" / []
Hahahaha !  What a scum human...Please tell me you don't listen to this man....trash / []
Guy lies worse than Bill Clinton / []
Ya el mundo sabe que este individuo '"your hinnes "😂😂😂 pasara a la historia como  el  príncipe" de la familia Real.  Que resultó ser  un  " depredador s3x*al "  😂😂😂 .  Your Hinnes 😂😂😂😂. My ass / []
Liar, liar pants on fire! Ugh-this is so embarrassing to watch! / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HByZX6PLbI / []
Pictures tell a million stories. Pictures do not lie. I love the response, “ I, have no recollection of that “ . / []
Shady business indeed. “ It was a convenient place to stay “ makes absolutely no good sense at all. Disgraceful / []
The only difference between Prince Andrew and a pedophile is absolutely nothing. / []
The interview that you wished you never did. I think more people know about his involvement with Epstein now, including me a guy in the middle of the beautiful sand dunes of Arabia / []
Wooden nose / []
Went for a walk in NYC Central Park to tell a convicted Pedophile “we shouldn’t be seen together” …. & this from a guy who had the most expensive education money can buy 😳 / ['And then stayed 4 days in his house']
He said straightforward shooting weekend. Like he knows anything about straight shooting 😂😂 / []
Dont you just love a fall from grace, especially this sleazy monster..... / []
Was…. A member of the Royal family….liar / []
I have no recollection of anything ever. Well, yes but no. O, yes but not really. 🎉😂 / []
What a jerk… because I was being shot at….😅😅😅 / []
What a transparent pitiful excuse one and all / []
Believe, I believed😁 / []
🙈🙈 utter car crash / []
Can't remember the foot massage?What about a happy ending / []
22:05 I’m starting to be able to sweat lol no kidding / []
Here is a guy who would say anything to save his own skin. How many 16, 17 year old girls (including Virginia Giuffre) has he molested? Kash Patel might be able to put him where he belongs, in Jail. / []
Just watched 5mins turned it off can't watch any more , what a shithouse he is, in the good old days he would be locked up in one of the towers. / []
Now its been proven he kept in contact with him. Well after he said he stopped. 😊 / []
The stammering and stuttering says all you need to know / []
OMG, hé is such a liar ! 🤮 / []
Liar Liar Pants on Fire!   Haha you can tell by the body language….!!! / []
How the fuck can he get away with blatant lies!!!!!! And still we keep him going in Range Rovers and really I'll fitting suits / []
Keep talking bud. Digging yourself  hole from nyc to the Caribbean, back to the royal palace mate. How dare you bring him around your kids. I don’t even meet with a women to break up. Lia / []
What a clown!! She held it together so well when she probably wanted to punch his not so sweaty wee royal lying face / []
"it would be incompatible for me to be SEEN with you" is very different from "you're a horrible human being and I don't want to have anything to do with you bye" and again "it's not something that was becoming of a royal family" he's basically saying he didn't mind about epstein being a sex trafficker, he only cared about not being seen with him because of public image reasons / []
What a lovely man 😂 / []
This is a master class at lying horribly. / []
Hello BBC woman, Lie, Lie, Dodge, Lie, Dodge, Dodge, Dodge, Dodge, Lie, More Lies, Lie, More Lies, Dodge, Lie, Dodge. Un sweaty, Dodge, Lie, More lies. Pizza Parlour, can’t remember, not sweaty, Dodge Dodge. Bye / []
NONSE / []
Lock him up! / []
Hyoid / []
"I have been over and over and over and over and over again" to find stories to explain away what I have done , is what he means to say  If u are innocent u dont spend time over and over trying to remember if u did that thing. If am accuses of wrong doing and i did not do the wrongdoing i would not spend time thinking over and over and over trying to remember about the thing I did not do / ['All he had to do was denying…']
Why does he bother with these interviews? People are going to ask u about sleeping with minors and u will deny it and look horrible doing it so bad advice from your lawyer. / []
Don't want to say what I feel about waste of space people. / []
Prince : Mr Epstein behavior was unbecoming,  Reporter : Unbecoming? He was a sex offender  Prince : i was trying to be polite   I like the reporter she is like a loving  grandmother , question a lying grandson.  😂😂now we know prince was Capping, About his sweat 😅 / []
After 9 minutes you know already he destroyed himself…. / []
2025 anyone? / []
Donald Trumps twin 😂😂😂 / []
His body language and facial expressions shows his guilt / []
Who is here 2025 after Diddy led you here / []
I'm glad we can comment 😅 / []
I did not sweat at that time 😂😂😂 / []
He was a pedophile  I'm trying to be polite 😂 😂 / []
What a train wreck, he’s avoided all the necessary answers proving his knowledge. participation and guilt in his actions. / []
Im not sure if he's lying, and Epstein would have changed his behaviour when prince Andrew was around, to be honest anyone can fake a photo. Maybe she just chanced it to see what she could get. I believe she new what she was doing and was Paid very well. / ['Have you done any research on said girl where is she now etc.']
What Emily did here was genius...one of my favourite humans  ❤ / []
This is about the only time ive ever watched the same piece on newsnight more than once! / []
This is HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂 / []
Do not explain makes.a lot of sense here. I csn't watch this. He is lying and so badly / []
LIAR! / []

Prince Andrew thought this was a win! / []
This feels like when I was questioned in the principal’s office, having had since the previous day to think about how I was going to lie my way out of trouble. / []
"I never really deed pah-tee" / []
His excuses are just as vile as his friend / []
Liar liar pants on fire…. He is comedic in his replies.  It’s like watching a 7 year old who’s been caught steeling from the biscuit tin.  He is an arrogant pl@nk.  The rest of his family must be so proud.  I would love to be a fly on the wall at Sunday lunch at Balmoral!! / ['What is he doing now?', 'The man is entitled.  He needs to be on the streets.', 'He has had is parties']
How does he know where the photo was if he's never been 'upstairs'? / []
Love 💕😘 off to hustling work not prostitutes❤😂😂 / []
Wow!  The movie Scoop did exactly like  this….GREAT JOB! / []
You can always tell when Andrew lies, his mouth moves. / []
In another life Emily Maitlis would have been a formidable barrister / []
Every time he seems to deny anything, his eyes start blinking rapidly, a sure sign he's lying. / []
Worst liar I have ever seen / []
Anyone here in 2025 after watching Scoop on Netflix? / ['A very Royal Scandal on Prime… thanks for letting me know about Scoop… I will give it a go!']
The perpetual squirming is difficult to watch, Yuk 🤮 / []
Interviewer has fulfilled her purpose in life after this interview 🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
so much "princely" BS! / []
This guy is an absolute moron. He must really think we don’t have a clue what’s going on. You can tell this is someone who is far removed from reality / []
This should be taken down the royal family paid f his freedom / []
Lier!!!! / []
peadophile. its dusgusting he gets away with it hahaha / []
how is he not in prison tell me ????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is it because he is royslty. he is s paedophile it is that simple / []
His 3rd chin is offensive / []
I hope all his staff that he treated so badly over the years had some satisfaction watching this weasel make a tit of himself 😂 / []
Car/ train/ plane crash of an interview he is an absolute liar and thick as shit horrible little man / []
He shouldn’t be interviewed, He should be investigated / []
Why the hell has he not been jailed? Royal $h!£ my foot / ['Money and power, can get away with anything if you have either.']
Do you know what else doesn't sweat??  A Reptile / []
I have such an intense urge to pop a little pin into that plump, bulging neck. / []
11:50 bad actor. / []
Pay your bill 🍯✋🤠😩🏘️💩💩💩👹🥺🤮🤮🤯👿😈💔 bullfrog 🐸🐸🍼❤🎉 / []
"The photo is taken upstairs and I don't ever recall going upstairs..."  So how would he know where that photo was taken IF he had never been there? / []
I'm a retired Met police officer.... Just search on here for interviews with retired Met Royal Protection Officers.... It tells you all you need to know about Andrew.  He is as guilty as fuck! / ["I don't need inside information to identify when someone is lying. The traits are always the same."]
That Netflix look don't make mistake I remember everything from beginning 😅😂❤🎉 🗣️👣🖐️🥃😎🌂☂️☂️🚙🚛❤😂🎉 / []
Do want his cup I will buy for u kept I like❤ Blessings 🙏 family values successful good evening 🌆❤😂🎉❤😂🎉❤🎉😂 / []
I keep coming back to this interview... Andy was out there wilding with Jeff... / []
Anyone here from 2025 . / []
Very odd / []
Was he given the questions ahead of time? / []
I made a grave error, I’m sorry, it won’t happen again. Instead of this / ['Never mind an apology, he should be in jail.', '@davey8914\xa0 Of course he should be he should have atleast had the decency to be honest or else not give an interview.']
I’m sure this guy is so innocent 😂😂❤ .. / []
I find it so perverse that all the bodyguards that the fuck prince had stayed silent. They actually belonged in the dock right away. / []
He must be under the impression the world is stupid. "I went to end our friendship." To tell him we shouldn't be seen together, so we went for a walk together in a public park.😅😅😅 Never saw him again.  Oh it wasn't a party it was dinner. Can't keep track of his own BS. 😅 All about Maxwell being the friendship, yet staying at the dudes house, not hers? More BS. Dude is so arrogant thinking the viewers lack any intelligence. / []
If you ever feeling down about yourself just watch this and realize, at least I'm not scum of the Earth! / ["Only because you can't afford it", '\u200b@cairnethunderhoof6225no amount of money in the world could turn me into a sex offender ffs speak for yourself, someone check your harddrive ya walking red flag']
No🤪🤣🤣 / []
He remembers everything very well, besides the wrong thing he did. Of course !!! / []
Describes Epstein's house as a railroad station (metaphorically and literally). Many people in and out of the house, "I have no idea what they were doing there", says the guys who has security and a 20ft fence around his palace. / []
The palace knows ahead of time every ceta of what might possibly happen in every situation. Andrew is an old man but still a spoiled brat whom has been allowed everything his dark mind wants to entertain because he is the Queen’s favorite child. There should never be interviews T all, as well. Not a good look for the palace. / []
Everybody whos in deep shit should watch this and learn how not talking is the best way forward / []
I believe the saxon printed / []
I wonder how many times Megan and Harry have watched this.. / ['I can see MeAgain scoff at Andrew, but Harry have a laughing fit, knowing well he was into a lot of mischief himself.']
Disaster family of tyrants / []
They interviewed the interviewer and she was Gobsmacked he and his handlers bought this went great for him and she and her crew knew it was a bomb! They just held their breath until it aired. He was immediately removed of ALL royal duties after this aired. / []
Hold up!Look again at the notorious photo: Virginia looks ecstatic. She is fully aware of what she is doing there. I’m not condoning it but come on, perhaps she was thinking about the payout in the future. Honeytrap=moneytrap🤑 / []
🤥🤢🤮🤥 / []
I don't mind "The Firm" but it's unfortunate they've always suffered one complete wrong'n in every generation. Edward Vll, Margaret, Andrew & now Harry. It'll never change. / []
British people are cool until they start in their quaint fascination with the crown. Fredo Corleone here needs to get a job selling insurance instead of (still) living a lavish lifestyle. This guy is above most Brits? COme on, y'all. / []
Acabo de ver la película en Netflix, que barbaridad no le salía sudor por los poros, sino mentiras, increíble 😮😮😮 / []
Lmaoooooooo anyone can read his guilt like a book 😅i had a medical condition where i couldnt sweat😅stupid rockspider grub / []
Andy "I'm not a confrontational unless my teddy bears are lined up incorrectly" / []
she should have asked him "how many times have you been to epistein's island??"  the interviewer missed A TON of opportunities to catch him up in other lies. / []
He almost looked like he was going to say "7 or 8 other girls I can't get it up for one women let alone 8!!" / []
G U I L T Y / []
yes "I'm royal I never go to pizza parties in trashy places like Woking" I only hang out in Knightsbridge, Kensington.  I DON"T GO TO WOKING! are you mad.  if it's not the Ritz I'm not there.  I'm not like all you pee-opns, I don't mix with the little people. / []
I don't sweat, don't know where the bar is - this guy is so used to everyone saying "yes, Sir" he can't even hear himself. / []
Andy "no I don't regret meeting him - he introduced me to all the shady people who gave me under the table money so I could sell out the british people".  A close look needs to be looked at everything Andrew did while supposed representing Britain under the guise of "British Trade".  there are all sorts of shady deals. / []
yes you stayed a number of days and you just lied that you left the next day.  he can't keep track of his own lies.  i guess he's been lying everyday of his life and people just suck up to him. / []
yesh randy andy you're such a pillar of morals and decorum.  what a jerk. / []
i'm sure he's pissed he's the only one to have to pony up money.  Jeff's list is long and full of millionaires Clinton got off without a scratch.  He only saw her twice, that's the biggest sex payday anyone has ever seen.  he should have just said yep I met her, we had dinner, I thought she was 20, she was just 3 months off her 18th birthday and she looked and acted like she was in her 20s.  Yes I did it but didn't know her age.  it was the cover up that got him. / ['I have to watch this again just for schitzz and giggles 😂\nIt definitely deserves an award.']
foot massage???? he and wife are both into feet!!  how hillarious. / ["I'd love to have heard the two of them, when they were told they couldn't attend the Christmas celebration with the family because of his association with the alleged Chinese spy..😂"]
...and they were all doing it Clinton, Bill Gates, politicians, lawyers, judges the list is long and yet andrew is the only one to pay a dime. / ['Trump paid twice..Pity the Queen wanted none of it going to court, watching Andrew being cross-  examined would have been a barrel of laughs.']
he was a frequent flyer on the liolti express.  I actually think this whole Dufrey thing is really nothing much, Virgina was months away from her 18th birthday and I'm sure he never asked how old she was.  Virginia was having the time of her life, they all were, they were all girls from trailer trash families, they'd been having sex a long time before Jeffrey got a hold of them.  Sudenally they were flying on priate jets, meeting millionaires (instead of having sex with their uncles in a trailer park), they got clothes, money (they all jumped at the chance to be Jeffries "massage therapist"; recruiting wasn't difficult at all, they came to Jeffrey in droves.  Virginia wasn't a sex slave, she could have left anytime, no one was raping her, this whole court case is an insult to women who are kidnapped, held hostage, killed and sexually assualted. / []
he's such an entitled snob, straight forward shotting weekend "you know, like everyone has".  what a prig, entitled, soiled weirdo.  someone should have been watching this guy - he was able to do whatever he wanted.  his real scandal isn't the sex but the money he pocketed during his time as british business envoy - if they turn over those rocks, they'll find many more significant, jail type crimes. / ['Both Sarah and Andrew were grifting whatever they could peddle big time.']
he was advised to bring up the navy and the fauklands - the only half way nobel thing he's ever done in 65 years.  and his stint in the navy was very short. / []
What a stupid man. Im glad Im not his daughter / []
What a horrible airhead.Shame for Britain. / []
Best worst interview ever 😂😂😂 / []
it's designed for 7-14years olds and we have 500k signed up.... / []
What he did with a 17 year old in the US was stupid 😂 In the UK it would be legal under Westminster law 😂😮 / []
Finally Oscar gose to R*pist Andrew! / []
“Scoop" Movie bring me here❤ / []
"i dont think we should be seen together" ............."Lets go for a walk in the park and discuss it" 🤔 / []
He Will go down / []
There was only one question missing: "how do you explain the images of Jeffrey leaving the apartment with a young girl, and you open the door and another teen goes out, and you wave byebye". / ['“It wasn’t me”', '\u200b@ali3liaI have no recollection of that happening', "well there's the thing, I cannot wave bye bye.", '@TheEfpTVit’s because I didn’t have hands back then because they had to be amputated after a hunting accident. My limbs grow back in a few months, it’s related to the sweating condition I mentioned earlier.', '😂\u200b@ali3lia']
Maitless hesitate as you climb in hun... / []
Ha. I dont sweat. You sweat when you hit puberty... / []
It’s disgusting that this man could have been King of England. He shouldn’t be allowed around children, even his own. 🤢 / []
We all know he/his people were the ones behind jeffrey Epsteins “suicide” / []
"FFFFFOUR TIMES A YEEEEAR!?" / []
“My judgement was colored by my tendency to be too honorable”   Wow, I can’t believe this was 5 years ago. / []
Watch this every couple month reminds me of the Office Ricky boy .I just wanna give him a JCB  to dig a little quicker. Comedy gold . / []
BBC = BUMMING BRITISH CHILDREN / []
I don’t sweat either🤣🤣🤣 / []
this guy was too nervous to appear truthful / ['This guy was too guilty to appear truthful.']
49:00 Maitlis: "This interview has been exceptionally rare ... is there anything you feel that has been left unsaid?" <Translation>: This is the ONE time you'll get to apologise or at the very least express empathy for the victims Andrew: (draws breath) "No I don't think so..."  Unbelievable. / []
Prince Andrew needs to be studied / []
Sweaty Andy. / []
This person is a member of a family that the tax payer is supporting, time to let them go. / ['Totally agree.  Time for a republic.']
It  is  easy  to  blame  someone  and  the  are  trying  to  prevent  the  truth  and  it  is  not  easy / []
Any news on this no? / []
What an excuse of a man !  Posh talking bollocks again!! 😢 / []
What a scumbag / []
A dinner? No I don’t eat dinner. In fact I can’t eat. I photosynthesise in the Palace greenhouse. / ['😂😂😂']
Since when do men meet to break up a friendship? Anyone who is honest about it all knows men don't do that. They either have an "eff you" row, and walk off, or just go missing / []
I've never seen a guiltier person in my entire life. And look at that bulging plump chin / []
We've all enjoyed the media value of Prince Andrew since the days of Koo Stark - he's done more for royal headlines than any amount of Trooping of the Colour. / []
This man is an idiot. Dumb MF. Child predator. I cannot believe his ex wife and daughters still stand by him. Disgusting! / []
Prince Andrew is simply not that smart, no streetwise radar whatsoever, essentially broke (given his lifestyle expectations and demands from his ex-wife and children)....just a simpleton really, that backed himself into situations he was clueless about. It's the reason the aristocracy and monarchy need to be ditched. Bloody idiots of the gratuitous public payroll. I don't believe he was complicit, just abjectly dim witted, stupid and entirely out of his depth. / []
Andrew likes his daughters....cu...........sick man...he should be in a US prison..... / []
I have Never met her ever...... ?   But i did give her £12m in compensation to shut her up ?   ok...... fair enough makes sense now. 😁 / ['Yup😂', 'His mother the Queen made the payoff decision, to spare them further embarrassment..I bet Andrew would have volunteered to be cross-examined on a witness stand in a US courtroom.']
I'd not seen this before, just heard radio news about - It is Even Worse than I expected. A howler? / []
Son of Jimmy Saville me thinks ps Sarah Ferguson still sucking his lollipop 😂 / []
A filthy sexual deviant.......harboured and protected by a paedophile family organisation. / []
Towards the end, he answers like Ricky Gervais acted like he was lying when he's pretending to be telling the truth in the original The Office. So uncomfortably cringe to watch. / []
The duper's delight while she asks the questions about Virgina Roberts hovers just this side of perceptible, but you can see it if you study his face. / []
What a lier / []
“I want to be very clear: I do NOT recall that happening. I do not.”  He keeps saying things like that as if it’s a “no”. / []
"that couldnt have been me in the photograph because cameras werent invented then actually i dont even think i was born then" Andrew - / []
Nothing says "I'm a victime" like being paid $20m. / []
English members of society, should demand him to be jailed or removed to another country. Saudi ? / []
Liar liar palace on fire, we're not stupid andy / []
I hate when he keeps saying WE WE Dont know blah blah like he's throwing his staff in this mess. There is no WE. / []
23:51, 24:44 for notable "excuses". / []
Royalists be like: Quick, look over there! Harry’s married a black girl! / []
Emily is my hero and well done for the team for pulling it off. Pity BBC has ditched long -form interviews like this on Newsnight. / []
Is anybody on his side? / []
He does not blame anyone else. However there must have been Plenty of  opportunities to meet diplomats and legitimate business people  via the uk mission to the UN and other embassy cocktail parties and dinners / []
doesn't sweat 🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Too honorable to brake friendship off with convinted s** offender but not too honorable to free load a house stay for few nights! Insane how stupid some are even after best education not being able to lie better and even form slightest idea on how normal person with common morals would act, at least I'd assume he'd be a better liar. / []
THE GRAND OLD DUKE OF YORK, HE PAID 12 MILLION QUID, TO SOMEONE HE SAID HE NEVER MET, FOR SOMETHING HE NEVER DID. / []
What a shame this are the people who are telling other countries democaricy and the rule of law and morality. / []
Most people can relate to giving £6M to someone they'd never met / []
Absolutely insane. / []
His security detail records can and should be used to prove the truth. / []
Andrew the Liar, the GOAT of gloat, the Prince of Entitlement, Mummy’s Little Monster…. / []
They all the same / []
You don't have to be a genius to figure out that this guy is lying big time. Whoever coached him before the interview did a lousy job of it. A truly pathetic display. If anything, this only solidifies why the entire royal family needs to go. (I cannot believe he was stupid enough to try to blame his continued relationship with Epstein on his tendency to be "too honorable". It would be laughable if it weren't so pathetic. This one is definitely the result is some heavy inbreeding in that family). / []
The prince of disgust!!!!! / []
Pinocchio auditions on going / []
HYPOCRISY & NONSENSE:   UMMMM. Maybe it’s the Press / Media who can’t read the truth that is more important to look at ……the ‘’alleged Chinese Spy’’  was welcomed to U.K. and the money he brought by two U.K. Prime Ministers as in:  PM Teresa May - & - PM David Cameron  …. welcomed to Downing Street, without clearance from M15 - MI6 - highly unlikely - the latterly [ years later ] alleged Spy was wined and dined by the Political Elite - everyone - of importance was involved - & - he was latterly introduced to the Queens son Andrew, [ a Falklands War Hero ] so that he could befriend him, assist in bringing business from China to U.K.    is it now being ludicrously suggested, in the months, years, this so called Spy was welcomed by two ( 2 ) British Prime Ministers etc., he was never ever vetted by MI5 / MI6, to insure his credibility, if both major security services were happy to give him the Green light - to latterly involve Prince Andrew - how come their not being held to account now - or - PM David Cameron & PM Teresa May who happily welcomed the Chinese businessman / diplomat with open arms ….. why is it now only Prince Andrew is ‘singled out’ is extremely ‘sinister’ makes no sense at all as he’s not responsible in any way whatsoever, what’s behind it,  an anti monarchy agenda at work ? / []
There's no good time to talk about Mr Epstein, so I'll fly to New York to tell him I can't be friends with him... / []
I can't be your friend any more but let's party for a few days. / []
"An airplane crashing into a supertanker causing a Tsunami.. ..." / []
The Prince ended up paying £ 4 million per f*** that did not happen to someone he never met. That is rather generous. / []
The Epstein connection falls directly with the entire royal family.  They cannot dodge responsibility until Andrew is jailed for at least 10 years. / []
Garden variety pervert. Strip him of all money and titles. Make the c-sucker get a job. / []
He's no different from they guy playing pocket pool under the sliding board on the children's playground. Don't believe this crap. Once a perv always a perv. / []
I just watched the movie called ‘Scoop’. My take on this it by having an interview with BBC, doesn’t make him innocence. How many times you have seen the s3x offender admit that I did it? / []
Talks out his ars / []
🤡🤡🤡 / []
fix in this interview that the prince : sex offender and sex abuser. / []
Scandalous, I've never thought I could facepalm that many times 😅 / []
...absolutely no 'activity' sounds remarkably like a code word to me. ACTIVITY?? / []
I don’t remember if I ever raped a minor. Bad memory…. / []
If you are absolutely certain that you did nothing wrong, you never enter a settlement, even if your family forces you to do so. / []
Did Epstein have videos of any of these stories??? / ['Yes. FBI has it.']
He knows exactly what he was getting into, he will have to live with this the rest of his life. / []
I wish he was under oath. / []
Why is his nose growing 😢😢😢 / []
Wrong un always has been / []
I'm glad this interview happened. Watching it in full for the first time in 2024, after watching the movie Scoop. He thought he can talk his way out of this, he just didn't know the questions. / []
GO AFTER HUNTER BIDEN GO AFTER K.HARRIS GO AFTER TOM HSNKS GO AFTER JIMMY KIMMEL GO AFTER BEYONZEE GO AFTER GAGA GO AFTER CELON DION AND THOUSANDS MORE IN USA ENGLAND CANADA FRANCE STOP THIS MOCKERY CIRCUS SHOW / []
Was this after Epstein “died” ? / ['Oh yeah']
this has to be the best car crash interview ive ever seen, what a horrible little worm of a man / []
20:24 " I had taken Beatrice to a pizza express in Woking about 4 or 5 in the afternoon." So he recalls this memory specifically on that date, but not meeting Virginia on multiple occasions? Sounds legit (N.B, that is sarcasm) / []
“I don’t know where the bar is at Tramps!” / []
He calls the nightclub “Tramps” 😂 / []
He was referred to as “Randy Andy” way back in the 1980s. Always had a questionable personal life. / ['Academics, politicians, people from the United Nations. Perverts all of them.']
This is a funny case study / []
was he bad guy or just stupid and unluky wrong person in the wrong time ? / ['both!']
listen over and over to what he says at 1:53 about how Epstein brought the *"MOST EMINENT people in the US together"* .... and you will know exactly why Epstein is now dead. Man just gave it all away. / []
Liar liar pants in absolutle flames..medical condition liar!!! / []
The only thing better would be if chris hansen did this interview / ['She dismantled him.']
Funny he remembers certain dates but don't remember anyone he slept with ive never heard so much shit outta 1 mouth and ive been to Scotland and Liverpool / []
Why are we, the tax payers, paying to keep at our expense, him which is bad enough but also his ex wife (who he divorced years ago) in Royal lodge. Cmon your Majesty, get them out!!!!! / []
"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake" / []
🤟👍😀 / []
Does he honestly think anyone with some kind of education believes him.I would have more respect if he just said yea I was wrong. He belongs in prison. / []
Geezer is guilty as / []
He's got bags under his eyes. Probably he never slept well. / []
Bless him. He was used to living in a world where people listened to him and pretended that he wasn't a moron. / ['😂😂😂', "That's why he made such monumental errors of judgement!", 'Now everyone knows he is.', '😂😂😂', 'That made me LoL 😂']
He was sweating during that interview / []
hand around a waist and a man is condemn ?😴 / []
Some ladies take many opportunities to go after rich guys  with accusations of all kind, some look for scandals, attention, money etc I believe he is innocent and fell in the wrath  of a public that like to throw stones in the arena of the medias! going to see Epstein does not means he participated in anything! What a world !!!! Prince Andrew is naive, kind, honorable and obviously oblivious of what was going on! I feel sorry for hm / []
Canada Heats royalty / []
What a bullshit piece of shit this guy is I live in Canada we don't need no Prince we don't need no King and we don't want no Queen fuck all of you / []
Prince Andrew gets the enormous privilege to defend himself (badly) publicly. / []
Legal Age of consent is like 16-17 in the UK..What is this all about? / ['The children were sex trafficked.']
This guy just pissed on the whole nation, and no one can do nothing about it . / []
10:21 is one hell of a Freudian slip / []
I suspect the Sussexes are an engineered smokescreen to shield the Royal Family's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. This Megxit is to steer the investigations away from the Royal Family's involvement with human trafficking. Notice the Megxit timing? Andrew's interview was in November 2019, and Megxit began in January 2020. Also, why didn't Harry mention anything about Prince Andrew's friendship with Epstein and Maxwell in his "tell-all" book and interviews? That would have been the perfect information to add to make his family look bad. / []
17 year old are inocent.  just look at Southport. / []
49:11  after all that, he has to throw in a little jab saying SHE “dragged it out”, hilariously rude, I mean my god! / []
Can you please delete? P. Andrew (former) / []
This Royal predator is another level.... He thinks we are stupids or dumbs. This is the face of a rapist with his friends epstains / []
The emphasize of caoz ❤🎉 A properly cros❤😂❤😂🎉 😌 bloody cute❤😂🎉 / []
No sweat interview 😅 now he’s close friend is a Chinese spy according to news today .  Awful interview btw / []
God. (I am just shaking my head). / []
Funny how he uses Jeff’s girlfriend as an excuse when she herself was convicted of trafficking. If this guy’s truthful then I’m the king of Mongolia / []
Jesus, dig up stupid ! / []
Serial pedophile / []
What a dick / []
What a moron 😂 / []
And he was the Queens favourite son? / []
he got fucked by jeff he went out there to borrow money after the arrest n tell gim they dhoulsnt b seen together anymore. and jeff used the money to pressure him into staying for the weekend. took him straight to central park and made sure photogs were there / []
Who else noticed the look of panic and disbelief on his face at 13:42 when she tells him John Brockman witnessed him at the party? 😳   Man has NO poker face 💀💀💀 / ['just u']
He's a clown 🎉,in  a swarm / []
Yer King s brother 😂😂😂😂IRA / []
So sickening spoiled liar brat!! that’s what it is !!🤮 only this kind of mortal gets away with all that mess because his upbringing cus his mother the Queen (R.E.P) 😮😮 goodness 😤 / []
I'm Irish, some of my best friends are English Welsh Scottish, this man is embarrassing nothing like he's loyal service Men and Women / []
-  can we just clarify things  here for a moment?............  ....he's paid  15 million dollars to a relative stranger  to settle  for a   SMOKES  PACK  KODAK   SNAP  with  her ....?    .......Andrew  .........   ..........O____o.........         *********      THIS   DOES   NOT  LOOK   GOOD   mate  *****  people have Brains Sir............they  can  figure things out    ............didn''t  you know......? / []
Why is the Royal Family still a thing? / []
Not the home run to the BBC that is portrayed in the recent miniseries. / []
Did he shag her in all honesty / []
The  walk in the park was the safest way to tell Epstein to keep his mouth shut about you ,omg! Your such a bad liar ,knowing a phone call can be traced / []
i am sorry but it is ok to be tempted by a young girl. We are only flesh. And that is the hard part. I love you andrew. / ['It’s actually not okay at all.', 'Oh brother']
Eye flutters constantly… Every question is answered by “ I don’t think “ or “ I don’t remember “ Such a terrible lying old creep. / []
I wonder what would have happened if that had been his daughter's being trafficked for sex 😠 / []
This is pure comedy and tragedy 🎭 / []
Unbelievable painful and embarrassing. / []
What a gobshite who advised him to do interview but he probably to thick to understand / []
A spoiled, entitled monster who cares nothing for people, only himself. Lovely royal family. / []
the guy comes across really un-intelligent but you can tell he thinks he is / []
2024 this man lost everything because of this interview! / ['Yes. He lost most everything, except he should be in jail. HE THOUGHT THIS WOULD HELP HIM! lmfao']
Trainwreck / []
She was r_per her and didn't know it and can't admit it and admitting it to himself and what all that means he finds it impossible to take ownership but maybe he'd have more sympathy and understanding. / []
BRAVO TO THIS INTERVIEWER👏👏👏 She behaved SUPER PROFESSIONAL and this guy revealed HIMSELF🤷‍♂️👏 / []
She's a fantastic interviewer. / []
Price teddy bear / []
Interesting slip of the tongue at 10:17: "He (Epstein) did not go into any great depth, in the conversation, about what * I * WAS DOING... about what * HE * WAS DOING..." / ['Spot on, I also noticed it first off the bat']
7:45 - So he ceased contact with Epstein in 2006.  8:48 - Then in 2010 after four years of "no contact", he flew to his house to tell him he wants to cease contact !? / []
I wasn’t that close of friends with the p3do. But I had my security go through all the logistics for a weekend trip to visit him & break up honorably. Amazing. / []
C’mon! The poor guy racked his brain & thought & thought, but can’t remember! That means there’s no way he could’ve done it!🤣 / []
Would’ve been better to just avoid an interview all together.  Wtf was he thinking??🤣 / []
Well…I’m convinced.🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤡 / []
One day in the future the scenario will be the BBC panicking. If you know what I mean. / []
There is no excuse for a Prince to do what he did. / []
I'm embarrassed watching this. Lord have mercy. I've never seen anything so icky. / []
Going to jeffreys was not to.party certainly not it was to fuck underage girls woman do your homework on me if you want to interview me 😂😂😂 / []

What does the lawyer that represents the Guthrie family say about him? / []
This man should have taken lessons from Elizabeth Holmes 💯💯 / []

The only thing truthful he said is that the mansion was like a train station with people coming and going / []
SOCIOPATH. He actually blames his troubles on his "Tendency to be too Honorable". 💩 / []
Those "royals families' always have been with prostitutes. He's terrificant Liar!!! / []
He must be a spesial needs persion. Just a desition to do an interview having trying to hide the truth. / []
A terrible interview  where on eart did  he come from? The lies and untruths and made up stories like mad through his fiburations. He was just unbeliable story. Not credibble at all. Liable for telling all the lies. I do not belive a word of what he is saying. He sounds like a complete idiot. Not trusting him for a minute totally unbelivable. / []
Randy Andy was a discraced man / []
he looks like sincere and a decent person. / []
He had him killed too / []

Seeing it completely for the first time; 1) Why did he gave such interview? 2) Did anyone care to advise him on how to handle difficult questions? but then I realized that as a  character in a novel 'the culprit of his demise is his egocentricity' and as the saying goes, 'man is the product of his environment.' / []

Liar / []
A photograph of a photograph of a photograph? What / []
Wow so he’s defending sweating.. incredible / []
Woo busted! She described the details about your encounter. You are lying / []
Wait what? You went because of his girlfriend? Noooo / []
Him cocking his head to the side says guilty! Stop lying sir. We do not believe your story! / []
He is caught. He could not have been there at his house and didn’t see or participate in these activities! / []
He is caught. He could not have been there at his house and didn’t see or participate in these activities! / []
He was or he wasn’t at this party. He saw Epstein place as convenient, knowing what was happening. / []
His whole demeanor is saying he is Quilty as well! / []
He is lying. He’s stuttering way too much! He went to that party. He knew he was involved! / []
🎶🎵 the grand old duke of York, He gave 12 million quid, To someone he'd never met, For something he never did 🎶🎵 / []
" it's a stretch to say Epstein and myself were close friends" Why did he feel the need to be " honourable" , and fly to New York to meet him in person to formally end their relationship? / []
He is a disgusting person, needs to be in jail, filthy lying pedophile. He thinks people actually believe him. / []
He showed up to the interview wearing live grenades as earrings and cheerfully pulled the pins. / []
I believe this dude...this chick slept with him.....but then she sniffed money so legal advice is recommended....i had a friend that had a girlfriend and he did not F***** he the way she wanted so she called police as if he rape her- 3,5 years in prison....i believe Andrew partied, slept with this chick...but not abuse her or rape her...and now they all go for money...Miss you were 17 y/o what were you doing there...no excuses...next day is school right! / []
Pretty sure he had a raging boner during the entire interview [for Epstein, not the interviewer] / []
Today, I decided to watch the movie Scoop. I watched all the way up to the part where the interview was about to begin, but I paused and decided to watch the real interview first. Then, I came back to the movie to see how it compared—and oh boy, they absolutely nailed it! / []
Bro has the lying skills of a 5 year old / []
See this is why I think Meghan was used a scapegoat. She is enduring and endured so much hate for no reason. While no one bats an eye for Andrew / []
The MAN is the one who takes “positive action” for sex?!? So the woman just lies there while he makes up his mind? And then just lies there passively while he takes his “positive action”? Good god - he reveals a very dark view of women and their agency there. Quite chilling. / []
"That event couldn't happen because I was eating a cheeseburger elsewhere", "Actually, I don't sweat, so I couldn't have been dancing with that underage girl", "That photo couldn't happen because I don't climb stairs", well, I guess it's a wrap up, guys, nothing we can do about it. / []
This is the face of evil. You would have to invent new words to adequately describe the degree of psychopathy we are seeing here with this man. Why you British people have not completely overthrown the royal family beggars belief. They all knew. They had Jimmy Saville in their Palace for goodness sake. How can you all stand for this? / []
Liar / []
He stayed at the home of a convicted sex offender because of his "tendancey to be too honorable" He actually thought of, and spoke out loud, this explanation / []
Pedoworld / []
Because he would admit to committing a crime if he did 🙄 / []
Prince Andrew went the andrew tate way 😂 / ['@jacksmith-mu3ee Proof? Evidence?']
British monarchy everyone  Highest education level  Highest possible traditions Highest possible standards of living Highest ranks in society  Highest level of connections Highest approach in Govt Monarchs of a developed nation  This is the result😂 / []
Allegations,,,for a payday!! / []
Watched this over and over and every time I think he comes over as a very low IQ individual who thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room.  Example: ‘She made (the) allegations in a deposition - are you saying you don’t believe her?’  Normal persons answer: ‘yes, she’s lying/mistaken’  Prince Andrew: ‘That’s a difficult question to answer - I’m not in a position to know what she’s trying to achieve…’  Is it dishonourable to say ‘yes she must be because it never happened’ when someone is falsely accusing you?  I’d suggest not.  Interesting point - interviewees often prefer to say ‘I don’t recall’ rather than make an outright denial when there’s a chance that their answer can be disproven.  It’s harder to be caught in an absolute lie when you say ‘I don’t recall’ - because they have to prove the workings of someone’s mind/memory and that’s pretty difficult to do…. / ['You described uk']
This guy is so out of touch with reality. / []
Well come onto that…. Noice. / []
This person has done so much good for the country, it's insane to think there's any evil behind their actions. I think it's a witch hunt. Also, the other person in the interview is Prince Charles, yeah he's an idiot. / []
She ruined him. I believe in Karma. The fact the guy thought that he could blag his way through that was insulting. / ["He'll be the death of the royal family. Well, him and King Charles Muhammad.", 'He ruined himself, she just allowed him to do it.']
Stephen hawking is there too / []
I’m only here because of Netflix….. / []
This man is just an aging, delusional, juvenile delinquent! 🤦‍♂️💤 / []
Fergie / []
He distances himself from Epstein but he states his real good friend was Ghislain. Well she got 20 years for trafficking. I think the interviewer should dig into his friend first. / ['Unfortunately she hadn’t been convicted at the time this interview took place…']
I’m not in a position to know and recollect 😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ / []
Spoiled little brat Andrew  Turns into perv entitled grown man child that takes no responsibility for anything / []
Definitely wasn’t cross-examined before this interview . I had some pizza on Monday on the 25th of August at 15:35 but I can’t remember if I met this person 😂 / []
I knew he was gonna say he never sweated in his life / []
🤢🤮🪣 / []
"I lost my sweat in the war"  incredible. / []
A bit of a stretch? He deserves a very long stretch in jail for his disgusting behaviour and his arrogance. / []
The obvious thing is He remebers the events he likes verry clearly  While the things he doesnt he vaguely remembers / []
I frequently fly across the world the tell my convicted criminal friends I can’t be seen with them. I also insist these meetings happen in public. / []
Royal parasite. / []
Chris Hansen really needs to handle this. / []
“Do you regret your relationship with a convicted sex offender?”  “Still no, because I got to meet a lot of famous people/other potential sex offenders”  Sterling defense there / []
If you are a celebrity or public figure, avoid journalists by any means possible. Give only written answers for written questions without meeting the nasty interviewer / []
What a liar... He's a pedophile figure in the company of Epstein... and he's not into the company of women... but into little girls...  'Fergie' ("My fair lady") has a lot of money, she has lived in the US for 20 years, and Prince Andrew has paid her 2 million British pounds a year. She has saved up and is a wealthy woman... they both trade on the Stock Exchange... have made a lot of money... / []
idk, he seems legit. Vote Trump y'all! / ['Trump, epsteins long time buddy']
Emily putting on a master class on interviewing people. Absolutely beautiful / []
Absolutely brilliant. My favourite bit is around 40 mins 30 seconds. The way he says "Oh yeah right ok ok". He's acting so casual, yet really, mentally, he's barely holding on. It's so brilliant. He's such an idiot. And on top of it all he's an absolute ghoul. A liar, beast and a deviant. Get him up against the wall. / ['Can you possibly imagine this nut being cross examined in court? They would just carry him straight to the electric chair.']
"My tendency to be too honorable" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA😂😂😂☠️ / []
People can think what they want about prince andrew but fact is he got away with crimes that he committed. / []
Why is noone asking where was the british security services when all this went on ? I mean he has 24hr security how on earth did they allow him to stay there or be associated with epstein in the first place? / []
Reality is way worse than the movies. It feels like this is a scene out of a movie, but sadly it is not, this is real. / []
His OTT posh falseness is nauseating. Also the lip smacking, double chin. Creep. / []
Is it just me oder is the part from 0:17 to 49:26 a bit eerie? / []
Hahaha such a small dinner hahanot and not  a party . What embarrassment t0 his mother wtf / ['Queenie paid a big sum of money so she must have been livid, not embarrassed.😂']
He said the photo was taken upstairs 😮 / []
Scoop on Netflix bought me here, had to watch the actual interview. Guilty as interviewed! / []

abolish the monarchy / []
What ship did he serve on in the Navy HMS BULLSHIT 😂 / []
39.30 I can tell you categorically I don't know why she is saying these things .lying gimp .WHY WOULD YOU GIVE HER 12MILLION QUID THEN / []
Cringeworthy / []
by my tendency to be too honorable xD can't make this shit up / []
Only someone who is lying would ever use the word "categorically". / []
He makes Boris Johnson sound fluent lol / []
Hello World, I am a Brit & we are ruled by these sort of people, Be grateful you are not a Monarchy. / ['You must be glad he was not the first child.', '100%']
Truly  pathetic the more I see this shit OMG. What a dummy / []
Pants on Fire 🔥 / []
Convenient place to stay wonderful choice of words 🤔 / []
Lmao / ['Lol']
Each time I see the part where he says “It was a convenient place to stay” I just crack up. He’s a PRINCE and could have stayed at any hotel in Manhattan. / []
Why did the Duke of Bullshit, settle with Virginia Roberts, for 12 million pounds? Never met her, don’t know her! You tell em Duke💩💩💩 / []
This is genuinely the funniest video that exists on the internet / []
"show leadership" / []
I’m the one sweating and cringing with all the lying he did for 49+ minutes / []
Lies beget lies. / []
This is an annual rewatch for me, too good / []
And if there was ... 😮 oops / []
That’s not my hand, because I don’t have any Arms / []
I’ve never heard anybody say, “I believe him”. / []
Andrew is full of BS. / []
Why he ever did this interview I'll never know.. Amazing watching him squirm though! / []
Classic rich arrogance to think this interview was a good idea. The most shit advisors of all time. / []
A few times a year, damn, I don't see my parents that much / []
You were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender: it was a convenient place to stay 😮😮😮😮😮 / []
So many absolutely clangers: I didn't know where the bar was at Tramp. I was at Pizza express in Woking. I'm guilty of being too honourable. I don't regret being friends with him because of all the interesting people he introduced me to 😮😮😮😮 WTAF / []
Ok, y’all. I’m satisfied with the Prince’s answers. Case closed. / []
That stutter effect when you get caught lying reminds me of my 13 year old son / []
🤣🤣 hes a liar / []
So he lies consistently and frequently.   Using 'we' to reference himself. / []
What a dreadful Interview for Andy. Its impossible for myself to believe anything he says. / []
Everyone is lying except Handy Andy / []
BS! / []
Lol he legit verbatim said the exact same thing they say on Chris hansen when they get caught..... '' I went to see him to tell him i can't see him anymore''.... / []
Shameful / []
This guy is a high science man. Lol / []
I didnt sweat At The time xD !  Genius / []
I mean, i am baffled. Even if it still looked bad for him after the interview if he was a good talker, there was no reason for him to perform THIS bad. He had so. Many. Chances. To give the best response... Its kinda impressive / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxwAB3SECtc / []
4:50 'a straightforward shooting weekend', eh Andrew?! / []
36:40 The way his throat dries up and he chokes from fear, at the thought of having to give evidence at a trial. 😂 / []
Whomever he paid to coach this conversation, did brilliantly. Yet , many of us see beyond. Sick person and family behind, and the trail travels. / []
Apparently he has constant security around him provided by the Royal Firm.  It would be a very simple matter for his security staff to come forward and provide documentation as to where he was the evening at the nightclub.  If he was being truthful he could easily substantiate his movements and clear everything up, but he hasn't.  Surely you would want this matter cleared up straight away if you were being honest. / []
I have watched this a couple of times and I cant believe the arrogance of the man. No wonder this has been watched over 10 million times / ['I think we share the 10 million views between us…', '@gabiausten8774\xa0 He is just so arrogant. The payment in the court case!! No smoke etc!!']
This interview is on the Mount Rushmore of comedy history / []
The fact that he thought this was a good interview for him shows just how out of touch he is / ['I agree 😂']
It's inconceivable his people failed to inform the Duke of Epstein's reputation, incarceration, or even the rumors. Can they just own up!? / []
Keeping no comment is a much better choice. / []
Put his British ass in jail mf / []
Looks guilty as can be. Body language / []
He speaks but all I hear are lies / []
This dudes breath smells like bullshit if you hear my drift. / []
Four times a year? Absolutely not. Twice at most. / []
Liar 😂 / []
it would have been much better too have had the young Laney in the same room and then see him sweat 😂just a thought did he get paid for the advertising of the pizza company  . / []
Someone give that man an Oscar / []
A strange individual with a very dysfunctional persona. Wonder what his excuse is? / []
En mexico tenemos una frase :es mejor no hablar y parecer que eres un tonto ,que ables y confirmen que eres un tonto😅 mejor no hubiera hablado yo aqui en mexico no conocia au voz y ahora digo😅para que habla?? / []
Through the whole interview you can come to a conclusion that this narscisist also had sexual intercourse with minors and he enjoyed it until his friend got caught. The sick mind of his is on the other side scared in this interview, he would enjoy it again, he just waits now for this scandal to vanish in thin air. / []
It's a bit of a stretch .....that's why I visited......this is actually tongue in cheek funny and I see a Monty Python skit from this.....and who ordered the Epstein suicide ? / []
This interview was a truly terrible decision by the Prince! He arrogantly thought he could convince the interviewer of his innocence! He came across as arrogant and pompous! A fall from grace!😮 / []
We're not only loan in academic or loan in sports as well ✍️💯🎁  We're looking for stars and returning payback period  It's quite easy  One doesn't want to lose  Under not notice❤😂😂 / []
Student loan  Open returning set job to pay back  It's quite easy  Because if I'm smart 🤓🌹✅ and have no help and somebody helps me to go to college I'm going to pay you back  Even if I have to spend the rest of my life to pay back I'm going to pay back❤😂🎉 / []
lol it was a convenient place to stay?  You’re a fuckin prince as if they’re wasn’t plenty of places to stay 🤣🤣🤣 / []
the look in his eyes screams "mammy please help me" / []
That is what I can only describe as me in that photo, but what we can’t be sure of is, is that my hand? / []
Not worthy of royalty, but neither is the whole family / []
Oh what a tangled web we weave…….. she’s got him tied in knots! Great interviewing technique! / []
He’s a delusional embarrassment, arrogant enough to agree to the interview, because he thought he would gain people’s trust and approval- Big Fail! / []
He should have been better prepped for this interview. Yowzer. Clearly full of it even to a completely untrained eye. / []
He really thought he could lie to us all and we’d believe him. Unparalleled levels of entitlement / []
The more he lies the more the bags under his eyes  gets bigger, by golly. / []
He’s polite and nonchalant. He speaks on a different level. / []
Is there any terminology as  :THE ROYAL AMNESIA : ? / []
He was lying  through his teeth during this whole interview. / []
HE didn’t want  to  New York to beak up relationship , he went these to make sure Epstein keep him out of the sasa if things should happened. / []
hands up 🙌 / []
You can see the lie in his expressions, the fear in his eyes! I feel sick that this people still free, everyone knows exacly what they did! :( / []
Ugh the royals...get rid of em all. / []
Damn, Michael Sheen did really well. / []
Pussy is sweet . / []
What a Turd! / []
Ive never been upstairs! That photo was taken upstairs, how do you know that sir? If you have never been upstairs.? When im in london i where a suit and tie 😂😂 this guy is a trip / []
Him-- do you expect me to remember every underaged prostitute ive slept with? I dont even sweat ! It cant be me ! / []
20:23 he remembers going to pizza express because him retrieving his own food is so unusual, but he cant remember drinking and sleeping with this specific prostitute because he does that so often / []
19:44 its not true because i dont even know where the bar is , i dont drink, in fact i dont have sex with woman at all 😂 / []
Coming from a good liar guys ,this guy is lying / []
He was a procurer of children and was blackmailing them all / []
“I’m not somebody who does things in competition with people, I work in collaboration”. What a saint!  Multiple contradictions. Cut Epstein off with a chat in Central Park and then attends a dinner party with him. Thinks he’s untouchable. Sadly for him, he is a very poor liar.! / []
What was going on with him when she mentioned John brockman? Like he was totally spooked. Makes you wonder what their history was. / []
😂 / []
I can't understand why the british still tolerate these people and look up them. / []
Creepy as fuck / []
People who want to cover up the truth often over-explain, telling things that have nothing to do with the actual question. If you ever watch interviews with Rachel Dolezal, she did the same thing. / []
What a devious character, absolute moron. / []
“Your Royal Highness 2+2=4, is that correct?” “Not necessarily, 2+2=5. That’s how I see it, you are looking at things from the wrong viewpoint.” “No, 2+2 always equals 4.” “Funny enough that’s incorrect. You are doing it wrong.” / []
What a load of untruths   He’s trying so desperately to behave innocent 😂 / []
This interview gets funnier n funnier / []
Well at least we know he’s not a chicken 🐔 / []
He, is so pathetic glad the late Queen, stripped him from  Royal duties... / []
I BELIEVE HIM. HE DIDN'T  HAVE TO RAPE ANYONE / []
What a pathetic little paedophile LOSER. Rot with Saville, you disgusting, disgusting "human". The fact this disgusting excuse for a human being will be bankrolled by the U.K taxpayer until his dying day is WRONG and SICKENING. / []
Digging your own grave. Time to abolish the monarchy 😂 / []
Who is here after watching A Very Royal Scandal on Amazon Prime?  I mean, the portrayal of him by Michael Sheen was amazing and Ruth Wilson's SPOT ON!  The buffoonery of this adult man is breathtaking. How anyone has ever taken him seriously is mindboggling.  He is an immature child who has been in bubble wrap his whole useless life.  While it might be fiction, the scene of him eating alone, outside at a long table, with a white tablecloth and a butler announcing the entree being placed before him will stay with me.  Is this how these people who do nothing of import and have literally never had a job, live?  So glad I am not British. / []
Supernonce. / []
Drew you are a very very bad liar!!! Your a moron a idiot a schmuck a blabbering imbecile and a disgrace 💯 A royal pervert thorn in the ass for you no longer living parents. They knew what kind of weirdo drew is especially the creep bear room he has till this day 👀 Drew you creepy fuck you!!! / []
I've probably seen over a thousand videos on YouTube, but this is one of the funniest I have ever viewed.   I'm not making light of such serious and hurtful events..... it's the interview itself that is hilarious. / []
How is he allowed to be out of prison. / []
Epstein was a guest at sandringham. Ewww. / []
He’s odious foul. / []
He’s so disgusting. / []
Such a pathetic glob of snot / []
You let your people starve / []

Why is this un-sweating person still occupying Royal Lodge? If little princey wanted to learn more about international trade why didn't he take some college or university courses? 🤔Prince Philip must have gone ape shxt over this interview. 🤣 / []
What exactly is a special representative for international trade and investment and what do they do.? Perhaps the word "special" has a different meaning in this case.   Lets be honest, Andrew isn't quite all tbere. / []
4 times a year,  what a dirtbag / []
منو الي اجه بعد فيديو عمر ابو الرُب😂 / []
The fact that he walked away from this thinking it went well is so unbelievable. this man has 1000000% never had to take accountability for anything in his life. he has NO idea how real conversations work. jeezus crust! / []
Me when I lie.... / []
Oh Andrew just retire quietly and stay away from the public.   Maybe if you keep your head down stay out of the public eye and go and live very quietly who knows we may forget a teeny weeny bit, who knows. / []
You stayed here, you flew on the plane, you went to the island, you invited him to your daughters wedding, even after you knew you still went there lol dude guilty. / []
I've racked my brain and I can remember every girl I've had sex with, not many,  23, but I won't ever forget them. / []
A disgusting man.... / []
A Very Royal Scandal brought me here. / []
I had to tell him in person I didn’t want to be his friend anymore …. / ["Well he was breaking up with him, so you don't want him to be one of those cowards that break up over the phone..😂\nWhat's odd with this is he never said when or if he ever told Ghislaine he can no longer see her, since she was his friend first..she was the one who introduced him to Epstein, and him and Epstein were just casual friends.🤔"]
He nearly said I have never been to Woking but then caught himself just in time. LOL / []

Come back to this video every now and then for some comic relief. / ['This is my second go round comical is definitely what it is', "The sweating is a good laugh..😂 the fact he was never upstairs in Epstein's house, but knew that the photo with Virginia was taken upstairs..😂", 'Same 😂', "Comic relief indeed!..I can see him sweating profusely when they told him he was not invited to Sandringham with the family for Christmas..I'd give anything if he did another interview this time on his latest escapade with the Chinese spy. 😂"]
There’s volumes of evidence against this individual that been hushed and destroyed. Absolutely travesty that this degradation was never charged. / []
L I A R ! / []
Unbecoming??? The bombshell / []
Andrew was sure sweating bucket loads doing this whole interview. / []
Here after seeing A Very Royal Scandal and Scoop. I think all actors/actresses in both did a very good job. This actual interview and the comments are absolute comedy gold.  That being said, the biggest jokes are the facts that he's still living in a 30 bedroom mansion for £250 a week and that his "mummy" paid £12 million to settle the case. / []
After watching this a second time I found Randy Andy really did put himself into a situation where he was just trying to talk his way out of a tigers belly. / []
Look at his tie! 😅 / []
“My tendency to be too honourable” what a disgusting thing to say / []
Imagine that thinking your abuser remembers you as a bother, a drip in the background...might've forgotten if it weren't for you meddling people at Newsline. / []
wow incredible interview. lets fight this too common abuse / []
Paedophile. / []
Proves one thing you don't have to be intelligent to be of royal blood and he is simply stupid and a phoedophile. / []
Here's the problem, If it didn't happen, there should be no doubt in your mind that the photo was fake. lol  I could come up with better lies when I was 10. / []
2006 Epstein everyone knew he was sentenced to prison.. procuring a minor for prostitution but this guy says he didn't know is didn't Care and invited to him to his daughter birthday party what the fu k. 🤣🥺😭 wow  He's not a great liar either BTW you can tell you're making up BS answers 🤣🤣why isn't he going to jail too ? / []
Andy giving 'toddler explaining why he shouldn't go to bed' energy here. / []
Did shs get semen samples????????? / ['Gooc question']
I do NOT believe that all those  girls were victims;  I think they were flattered to date Andrew but when Epstein  was caught the girls cried victim; / ["Ah here.....c'mon"]
A worse train wreck than the Netflix depiction. / []
Bag eyed  Love it😄🤣 / []

This seems like an interview between wife and husband… where husband is just got from boys holiday and wife somehow gets all the pictures… LMAO / []
40:35 Interviewer said "Epstein is dead" Andrew gives a big chuckle "Yeah" What a creep. / []
Trying to set him up too. That's what happens when you try to be a good friend. / []
If I was his friend I would think he might be innocent. / []
We're the telepaths trying to help P Diddy. They all forgot until we reminded them. You're welcome. Just another couple trying to do the right thing. Was just drawn to it. / ["Yes, telepaths.

One of the untouchable elite one of many many more! / []
Tbh I'm shocked the BBC aired this.. maybe theyre finally against pedos / []
How do you know the photo is taken upstairs if you haven’t been to the house? / []
He never once says “I couldn’t have had sex with her because I didn’t have sex with any young girls at his house”. He only says he doesn’t remember her. / []
Lo mejor .. asi q en Malvinas los argentinos lo hicieron mearse de miedo y se quedo sin sudor!!!!!! / []
1 rule for these elites and another for us. 12 million of taxpayers' money to cover his sick ass. Imagine an average person stealing the publics money to pay off his victim. Hed be jailed indefinitely. Then you've got schofield back on tv and edwards freed and allowed to keep his pension. Saville covered up for years harris the same thw list is endless, and the 1 thing they all have in common is that they are rich and in the elite, so they're allowed to do what they want. / []
“I described his house as a railway station” ….. NEXTSTOP NONSEVILLE  ! / []
Adventures of the incredible prick. He should wear a cape. / []
I’m just here for the comments. They are a hoot and a half. My faith in the wit of my fellow human beings is restored. / []
Andrew was wrongly and aggressively crucified.  He's wooden, but she is a shark with a bloody agenda. / []
Estoy aqui por el mejor canal: @mimixxl / []
Boaring move on / []
He was just voodoed, you see! / []
I have no recollection of ever being Prince Andrew / []
1:54: “He had the most extraordinary ability to gather nonses with silly amounts of money to an island full of exploited children” / []
He could have stayed at a conveniently located hotel / []
Buddy your done , we usually don't get these people 🎉 / []
The arrogance of this man is breathtaking. / []
Pedophile king ..lol Britain is still living in lala isaland to believe that these people matter.. throw this sex offender in Jail / []

I have absolutely no recollection of ever paying for anything in my life! / []
Mommy paid £12000000 for something that you don’t recall happening. GUILTY / []
It's just a shame that it's so easy nowadays for a woman to come forward especially one who's guilty of herself and make accusations against a man and everybody automatically believes her. / []
Why is she saying those things? Well let's look at the amount of money she sued and got. Money money money money money look how much she got from Epstein and come on where is all the other men there must have been other men she could have accused and sued. / []
As a matter of fact the woman was hiding out from the authorities they found her. She didn't just become honorable and decide to go to the police with this she was found and was going to be charged. I can't believe she got away with everything and made tons of money off of the scandal. / []
What makes me sick is that Jennifer got away with everything that she did and she's just as guilty. She's the one that recruited young teenage girls. And on top of her guilt she gets to sue for thousands and thousands of dollars. / []
But the only thing I really don't understand is his need to see Jeffrey face-to-face to say they can't be seen together. I don't understand if he wasn't a close close friend why he felt he couldn't do it over the telephone . From the beginning after everything I heard from the girl Jennifer I've never believed Andrew was guilty pedophiles are really sick and with him having two daughters that he raised some incident would have occurred way before this. And I also think if Andrew was guilty he would have tried to hide and keep a distance from Jeffrey not confront him or be around him. I bet there's 1,000 people who have a photograph of them self with prince Andrew / []
😂😂😂😂😂 / []
jajaj I was at home with the children 😂 / []
The girl was of legal age and simply wanted cash for the sex she provided. It's a warning to gentlemen to settle their prostitute's bill in full promptly. / ['She was 17. A minor. Youre disgusting', '"wanted cash", she was trafficked, it was proved by the freaking FBI', "My question is why would this girl hang out with Epstein, if she was a minor?\nI mean he was an old man.. How did she end up in Epstein's house?"]
What disaster  this is and he has no dignity just thinks he is above everyone else he irritates me always has spoilt I hv switch off from the Monarchy  know / []
honnestly , he looks like the dummiest ,less talented-smart  skilled  of his family! muejejeje / []
well, you dont pay millons of millons to shut her up if nothing happend and the picture is fake! actually if i were inocent i will not pay her a single penny and  i would sleep with no guilt  at night / []
You have to try to take some positive action… Wtffffff??? / []
This is mortifying. / ["He's mortifying"]
Didn’t happen…I don’t recall…I have no recollection of meeting her…I’m almost convinced that I was never entranced with her…I don’t know where the bar is…I don’t drink…I have never bought a drink… Omggggg 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ How did this interview even happen?! It’s so bad. / []
Guys don’t go for walks together to discuss the end of a friendship. Come on.  They just say see u later dude / []
Such  liar / []
This is great! Great success for Andrew! / []
I think he makes a fair point / []
Watching this now on Royal Scandal Season 3. Ruth Wilson did an amazing job playing her🎉🎉 / []
Can you imagine the behind closed doors life of a prince in a first world country. Epstein is just a glimpse. / []
You weren’t very good friends and yet still felt the need to go and see him? / []
Liar, liar, pants on fire. What a lying shit he is! / []
The shock coming through his eyes when she mention John brotman / []
Hahahahahahaaaa he's SUCH a cringey lying PRICK,!! / []
P diddy vibes  / []
What made his presented attitude outrageous is that Andrew was all about “there’s nothing to do with me whatsoever” without admitting Epstein is a godforsaken criminal who deserves condemnation or many underage girls had been cruelly exploited. In the sense of PR, he’s trying to emerge from a muddy pool hoping to come out looking clean. But the so-called clumsy speech that caused outrage, whether truthful or not, just shows that he has no real compassion for the victims. Just him for himself. / []
Only just catching up with this interview now and I have one question. If Prince Andrew went to New York to tell Epstein that due to his conviction they were going to have to break all ties as the Prince can't be seen in public with him, then why did he decide to have that conversation with him in a public park in New York? / []
He's a criminal. / []
What makes Andrew think the photo was taken upstairs unless he'd been upstairs. That staircase could well lead to a wine cellar. The Queen helping him pay Virginia off just goes to show how corrupt all the rlyals are. They are a disgrace to this country. / []
Time for a Republic. / ['Long overdue', 'Totally agree']
Man just tell the truth all lies / []
Pay 16 million to a girl ' you don't know and never had sex with ' . But he was on a foto together with her 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
A Very Royal Scandal on Prime was much better, IMO than Scoop.  I’m only here to validate that this interview was in fact, the train wreck I saw on the show, whew, this interview is much MUCH worse.  He invited Ghislane and Epstein to his daughter’s 18th BDay party?!?!? 😒🤬 Royal Security doesn’t do background checks??? / []
THERE WAS NEVER ANY NEED FOR YOU TO GO AND SEE HIM TO TERMINATE THE FRIENDSHIP YOU'RE LYING YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER YOUR ASS AND THAT'S WHY YOU ARE WHERE YOU ARE I'M SO SORRY THIS HAS HAPPENED TO YOU PRINCE ANDREW I AM SO SORRY AND I BET YOUR MOM IS TOO / ['So why is he on a foto with her with his Arms around her and why did he paid 16 million to a girl he never met ?\n\nThere where  is smoke , there is fire !!!', 'Because his legal counsel told the queen what was best for it to go away asap..']
MY ONLY PROB WITH ANDREW IS HIS ASSOCIATION.  BUT THE GIRL IN THE PIC?  DOES SHE LOOK SCARED? SHE IS SMILING / []
His arrogance is astounding. You can tell immediately he has no self awareness. / ['That’s what happens when you are a royal with no real duties. Similar to Harry and William. Harry got to be the party animal with no real responsibilities while William has been under a microscope since the day he was born.', "You can turn the sound off and still easily tell he's lying.", 'Also no empathy, no remourse.', 'Not that you misunderstand him. He has never had to successfully navigate conversation through lies and deceit in his life because there was never a time where there was any risk of failing. So he never had to learn how to lie proper. Therefore what you get is underdeveloped child like social skills and cunning. Absolutely no cunning perhaps that’s his saving grace. He almost singlehandedly convicted himself in this interview, a total fool.']
I just finished watching 'A Very Royal Scandal,' and the original interview in real life is just as troubling as the one in the TV series. As you listen to the Duke of York explain his side of the story, it's evident that he is not telling the truth. / []
Absolute nonsense you know what you did your mother paid her off you are a disgrace to the uk you look at women as easy prey would you want this for your daughters that’s why you have been dishonoured by your family and King Charles they knows our are a nounce  absolutely annoyed that you have been protected if this had been a person on benefits they would have been in jail hold your head low and be thankful you are in the house hold that protects you absolute disgrace your poor children must be horrified / []
I love how he had to meet up in person to "break up" with Epstein. Brilliant.  😂 / ['After 4 years of no contact.. I’m pretty sure if you haven’t spoken to someone in 4 years its evident to both parties that the relationship has ended']
Interesting. If the Virginia Roberts legal team says you (Prince Andrew) could not spend any time around Epstein and not know what's going on, what about Trump? Trump was supposedly around Epstein a lot more than prince Andrew was. Why hasn't the Press been on Trump about this? / ['Trump had him kicked out of his club after a woman/girl(not sure if she was an adult) came forward and said she was accosted by him']
What a plum! 😂 / []
" uhm x9000 " while getting backflashes about what he did. / ['It reminds me of when I was 17 trying to explain to my parents why I got dentition and how it was not my fault and how I was really innocent…(I wasn’t) lol']
This idiot buried himself deeper and deeper. Did he have nobody guiding him clearly not. He's surrounded by people that flatter him tell him what he has to hear to try to please him that they feel honored in his presence. This guy was giving. Everything anybody could want good education the name of Prince a title his mother is a queen. And what is he done with his life seriously what has he done with his wife. Doesn't know how to manage his money. He has people around him . His mother's people that could have easily helped them financially. He could have picked a career and they would have given him the keys to the kingdom. He is literally stupid in the sense that. Knowing that Epstein was already accused. You actually go and stay with him. You're taking pictures with him. Epstein didn't think you were smart he just used you because he can have access to higher officials up there. He even told people around him that you weren't the smartest person in the world. And that's really sad to think that you were a royal. My God who let you do this interview. You should have just distant yourself from epstein.. you go to an island knowing that there's a lot of young girls coming and going you knew better because of your family how stupid could you be did you think that oh my God everybody wants to be around you to think that you are a God because of who your mother was and that you're a prince oh Lord. You're delusional. You're actually a pedophile / []
What an awkward interview. He's squirming and obviously lying. He's not even a good liar. / []
The tie says it all...crooked. / []
He just looks so guilty, lieing through his teeth, blatantly / []
So he went to tell him that because of his conviction it's inappropriate to be "SEEN TOGETHER". Not suspicious at all 😂 No word about how inappropriate and disturbing it is that he was convincted?? / []
Epsteins house had 7 levels but I've never been upstairs actually it's more like a railway station  so maybe I was there just checking tickets and yes I'm staying in your house because of your Gf / []
This is like a 10year old kid trying to make up stories to get out of a spanking.What an immature fool. / []
I guess the Queen didn't buy his story. / []
Watching this conehead`s bullshit never gets old 🤣. / []
Your fired😮 / []
LIAR!! / []
Am I the only one who believes him? I think about one think, is too easy attacking someone who cares about public image, such a man could be easily a target of leeches who take advantage of such opportunities. Mix it with bad wording and confirmation bias and you can see the result yourself. Apparently his family cares about public perseption and he's loosing his house because of that. What a wonderful world. / []
Funny, you can Google if excess adrenaline will stop sweat and it actually makes you sweat more. Hummmm? / []
This is one of the greatest comedy bits in history / []
Only the privileged / []
But for his status as an untouchable Royal and the fact that Charles had to pay off the informants, Andrew would be in a cell next to Epstein. / []
My favorite part is at 13:42   A classic. 😂😂😂 / []
A lie detector test / []
Deflects the answers / []
So he was the victim? Was used. To protect epstein between the respectfull history of the monarchy. And andrew played into it not knowing. / []
There are hoyels in the u.s.a. nothing to do with honor to epstein. Is head is in a cloud.clueless. / []
There are hoyels in the u.s.a. nothing to do with honor to epstein. Is head is in a cloud. / []
Hes s 11:22 o unaware of his naivety in his devision of other people he thinks hes above everything. / ['I’m cringing all the way up the wall to this timestamp 😂']
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 / []
No closure for anyone in this Epstein tragedy and most certainly no closure or justice for all the victims and survivors of the crimes that he, Epstein and others, inflicted on them. / []
It was unapropiate for him  to see Epstein again?  This is so English 😮 and unfortunately so untrue wanting to be true for the cause of being " convenient " and "honorable "?? For God's sake 😢 / []
My life's a boring mess but every 6 months i watch this and realise i have my personal pride and morals / ['Omg same!', 'Don’t worry - everyone’s life is a boring mess. However for him, his life is just a mess hahah', 'Same', 'I fall asleep to it as every few months cause it makes me sooooo happy about my life and what i consider stress', 'My life is a boring mess also, during lockdown zero changed for me, many more like us, still better than this cretin.']
I was not close to him but I had to see him in person to break off the friendship?! Doesn't ring true. A phone call would have done the trick. / []
using the excuse over and over of being friends with his girlfriend is not a great excuse when she has been said to be just as culpable as Jeff / ["She's in jail now", '\u2060”Jail” is probably a country club. Don’t forget, Donald Trump himself came out and said that she is very good people. Look it up.\n\nAnd I’m just as disgusted with Bill Clinton, so PLEASE don’t bring your cognitive dissonance. They are all culpable. \n\nWhat a great choice for Americans!  🙄🤬🤮', "At the time of this interview she wasn't implicated", 'Oops…', "@KB-jh3rt\xa0 Regret, with respect to yourself, at the time of Prince Andrew's infamous interview, in November 2019, Ghislaine Maxwell had already been implicated in the scandal surrounding Epstein's sex trafficking and abuse allegations. \n\nIn August 2019, court documents were unsealed, alleging that Maxwell had played a key role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein's abuse. Maxwell denied any wrongdoing, but the allegations against her continued to mount. \n\nTherefore by the time of Prince Andrew's interview Maxwell's involvement in the Epstein scandal was already widely reported, and she was facing increasing scrutiny and criticism."]
well I don't recall and I don't even know where the bar is at so it couldn't have been me / []
I’ve got a medical condition, it’s called selective memory loss 😂😂 / []
Four times a year?, I must admit, it’s more than I get off the wife atm / []
😂😂😂 / []
How did his mommy approve this interview? / ['Because she believed in him, he is honorable 😂']
Filthy pervert / []
"...my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable..." methinks his judgement's wrong in the utterance of that statement too! / []
What a disgusting man. / []
. .. And Epstein committed suic3d2 right before he was giving more intel about all these powerful people...What a coincidence 🙄🙄🙄 / []
He was in the Falklands war 1982 and save many lives British and Argentinas ! / []
"I never had sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" / []
He seems to have inherited the family stutter suddenly. / []
Emily Maitlis put on a sheer masterclass on exposure. Certainly one that’ll go down in history and hopefully not be forgotten! And while Andy will never have to answer for his crimes, the whole world knows!! / []
"Just a straightforward shooting weekend" 😂 Shot himself in the foot throughout the interview. / []
Such a plank!!-Caught out and paid millions....so very dense😅😅😊😢 / []
This comments section is pure gold 😂 / []
To the women who accused him pubically, i believe you! / []
What a pompous idiot he is.. / []
Narcissistic people believe their own lies. / []
Yikes.  I had heard that this interview was a trainwreck, but this is the first time that I have actually watched it.  It's even worse than I had heard. / []
The UK’s own Bill Clinton 😊 / []
“So you did not get a foot massage from a young Russian woman?  “Absolutely not!!!**     **(she was from Uzbekistan) / ['@13:40 watching his eyes pop out of his head is amazing', '@KrudlerTheHorse he had that look like who told you about that lol']
Well here’s the problem … you fucked up! You’ve been caught red handed. Mucking up your words. Who are you trying to kid? / []
The fact that MI6 didn’t tell the duke anything about Epstein before the first charge. / []
If he was innocent he would have cut all ties immediately the moment any rummors or speculation began and if he witnessed anything immoral he would have reported it! He didn't he kept going back time and time again hes guilty by association at the very least! / []
That’s impossible because he can’t sweat / []
His face at 13:44 says it all 😂 / []
This is a PSA against marrying your cousins. / ['🤣🤣🤣', 'lmao', 'Well ,we have to allow for a certain amount of in breeding.  That`s a given with the Royals .Let`s face it .', 'Facts! 😂']
He needed money for his ex, as far as the other stuff , who knows? But it's irrelevant / []
Just watched " A very royal scandal" on Amazon Prime about this interview and saga. Excellent series to watch. / []
Well 2 years later Ghislane was sentanced for 20 years for trafficing and he was a friend with her, since University and it not credible he didn't know what Ghislane was upto - she was the organiser of everything.  And his defence he was only inviting and friends with Ghislane ( some defence now). I rumoured that secret service has possion of video's and Ghislane and Epstien recorded everything in his house and rooms. / ['EXACTLY him clinging to her like a life saver did not age well AT ALL 😂😂😂']
What a train wreck! He makes it so obvious he's lying. / []
семейка виндзорских дворняжек🤦‍♀️ комментарии огонь!😂🔥🔥🔥 / []
My vote for his most pompous moment …” It was a straight forward shooting week- end”. Yeah, buddy , we all go on these regularly ! / ['And entire weekend of a party 😂', 'The staggering amount of research in the ENTITLED book proves what an unbelievable liar he is.']
He makes my skin crawl / []
When I need a good laugh, I watch this along with the Ben Shapiro owned by BBC interview. 🤣🤣 / []
Honorable? How / []
Degenerate mummy’s boy / []
Andrew obviously didn’t follow his lawyers’ advice by giving this interview / []
https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?si=p1sbLseE7_EQkjdf&t=1083 he was in and out all over the place!!! / []
Hands up if you’re here after Royal Scandal on Prime / [':-)', 'That\'s exactly why I\'m here! I had to see the real interview before finishing the third season of "A Very Royal Scandal"!

How to catch a narcissist / []
Maybe everyone took lots of drugs / []
He’s such a bad liar / []
This is hilarious, awww they broke up / []
Could she interview Trump 😂😂😂😂🤣 / []
So Andrew is stupid but I’m not sure if Virginia Robert’s is an innocent. At 17 you know about sex. She wanted a better life and she found the wrong people. It’s always about money. And she got half a million from Epstein and Andrew, and a lot more later on. Big payoffs all around / ['Well…I hope you didn’t give birth to any daughters. Crap example if that’s how you feel about girls. Property?? WTF?', 'She was a child. Of course she wanted a better life. This is totally victim blaming.']
Ummmm, he can't remember if he banged a 17 year old 3 times? Get real Andrew! / []
HE IS A SPOILED  SON OF A B…CH!!..  HE IS SO GUILTY, HE IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST GUYS I’VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, ACTING LIKE A CHILD TO PRETEND HE DOESN’T  KNOW SOMETHING WE CAN ALL TELL HE IS ABVIOUSLY LYING ABOUT🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ / []
‘..that is what I would describe as me in that picture, but I can’t be certain as to whether or not that is my hand on her left side’  😂😂🤦‍♂️ / []
I didn’t know him well but I traveled to see him just to let him know I can’t see him anymore / []
It would have been better if he just came out and said I am guilty of being friends with him and I once had sex with a minor and I am deeply ashamed and I am sorry / []
Grotesque  Andy reminds me of Ted Bundy when he blatantly lies .He really is a vile individual. / []
pure cringe / []
P. Andrew, SHIT for BRAINS, no tablets can fix this KNOB HEAD... / []
I believe him...I also believe in UFO's and big foot.😂😂😂,, / []
I just had to watch this again 😮 / []
I think Andy is getting a hard wrap over this, He is obviously completely out of touch with public opinion but i think anybody would living the life he does, The photo hardly seems to show a vulnerable girl in distress in fact allegedly the camera was Virginia Giuffre own which she gave to Epstein to take the picture. / []
He needs to be punched in the face. / []
A very Royal Scandal? Holy cow is he slow? It’s like he’s gone through life packaged in bubble wrap. / []
I thought I’d try to watch this one more time…I just couldn’t get passed the first few minutes. / []
This interview is painful to watch. He gutted himself every time he answers her question.  Reporter questions him like across examining attorney. / []
Diddy should study this interview 😅 / []
Man doesnt have A SWEATING problem - he has  STUTTER PROBLEM !!!  🤪🤭🤭 / []
Perfect example of a grown "man" who grew up in a self centered - pampered bubble.  Answered to Mummy his whole life.   Buy an island and go away / []
Douche bag !! / []
Anyone else back to check the hair changes? / []
'None of these things happened.' 'Is she lying?' 'Very difficult to say...' / []
Epstein had the "extraordinary ability to bring different people together ; academics, politicians..." yeah Andy -  and now they are in Maxwell's little black book. / []
13:42 look at his face drop when Emily says 'John Brockman' its obvious he is a liar / []
Loved royal scandal, we so know who these people are. / []
I don’t believe him. Plus, all the travel, hotels, pizza express, receipts and witnesses etc would show records and the evidence would be complete. Then he pays her 13 million. No way, this stinks. The royals are leaches and time for the bin. Roll on the Republic of Scotland, that’s our future 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 get rid of this lot! / []
Here from A Very Royal Scandal / []
I just finished watching A Very Royal Scandal all seasons and I never knew how much drama has happened in different time periods within the royal family. I honestly, never been a fan of  the royal family the only people i loved and respected was Princess Diana of Whales RIP <3 who will always remain a true princess & queen and her beautiful sons Prince William & Harry. Even now with Harry leaving the royal family and I don't blame him for it. I can't imagine the pressure and scrutiny you have to go through in reality you don't have control of your own life its all for the "CROWN" I never really followed Prince Andrew I mean never been a fan of is brother now King Charles but, to me the fact he had a relationship with this monster Jeffrey says a lot of his character and he seems quilty in my personal opinion and the fact the young lady claiming what he did.... says alot. This interview destroyed him really! I'm sorry you have to protect the crown and your royal don't mean shit in life you have to take accountability for your actions period! / []
As a Brit I haven't seen this, the usual establishment goings on, just like PM Starmer & Underlings free loading whilst many pensioners will be cold this winter, Ive just watched the Royal Scandal first 2 episodes & will watch the real things before ep3. Nothing that lot do surprises me, they've been at it for centuries & some, counting.. / []
Watching the Amazon show about this right now. lol / []
This man obviously had sex with ubderage girls and he is allowed to walk free and still have a privileged lifestyle even with a drama about him on netflix its disgusting and britain should be ashamed / ['So what. So did the founder of one of the world’s largest religions who is revered. Why is it one rule for one guy and another rule for another? They both did the same thing', '@haruspex1-50 and they should both be punished but money, power, status, and religion protects these criminals and that has to stop at some point']
what a fu… liar ! / []
She didn't "tear him apart", he sank himself. / ['Give them enough rope and they’ll hang themselves.']
Why is the prince stammering so much? / []
Must be tough being "too honourable". / []
Here from Netflix / []
I think he sounded fine, like he was telling the truth. I don’t understand why everyone was so upset with this interview. He’s uncomfortable but that’s understandable. It’s an embarrassment position to be in. / ["you're utterly delusional and you're hard drives should be checked", '@KSJunior0 look at her photo. She hardly has hard drives. More like an abacus.', '@paulmarden3301 🤣🤣🤣🤣']
"Where you would meet academics, politicians, people from the UN". in other words, pedophiles lurk in ALL walks of life!  And Jeffrey Epstein was their golden ticket to their sick obsessions PERIOD! / []
This is an insane conversation. / []
You disgusting excuse of a human bean......you are just that ......a vomit / []
That is a journalist!!!! / []
PA was friends with Maxwell. She is in prison / []
Wow.  It's exactly as it was portrayed on A Very Royal Scandal on Prime Video / []
He can't have been seen getting a foot massage, at the time he had a rare medical condition which meant he had no feet. It's only because of things he's done in the recent past which has given him the ability to have feet again / []
It's like watching a child lie to their mum/dad after being caught doing something wrong / []
Emily is brilliant! / []
"overdose of adrenaline" 😂😂😂😂 FFS / []
43:13 look at his eyes when he says “in the dark”. / ['Woah that’s terrifying']
“I’m seeing you now to tell you how inappropriate it is to see you now.” / []
I love how his tie is pulled to the right, ready to go to the gallows. 😂😂😂 / []
What a w….r / []
Pea dough. And his mother paid his accuser off. Filth. / []
If Prince Andrew was dancing around sweating in Tramps nightclub wouldn't people know about it? Can't escape cameras, especially if are a Royal. / []
Liar ………liar.  ! / []
Paedophile king pin! I went there to spend some time and tell Jeff, no more underage girls for me at the villa! / []
That was a painful interview to watch / []
It makes me so angry that this awful man can swan about doing bugger all. Living in a rent free Royal Lodge and more or less giving the public the middle finger.... Shameful. / []
Here after watching a very royal scandal on Prime 🤯 / []
Very telling  interview And rew??? / []
Watched this again and cant believe that this man is still walking free and was brought up and surrounded by the family he is in, WHat else is hidden in this and his wider family? Makes me so sick. / ['Very well said spot on.']
Lie is written all over his face. One day you will face God. 🤣 Good luck! / []
It’s your turn / []
Liar Liar pants on fire / []
🤥 / []
This guy is awesome!!!  He is truthful, honest, and a victim of Epstein 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Talking rubbis😮 / []
He talking to much  mks him look  guilty. He is lying / []
Quilt ty / []
Haaa haaa omg / []
I'm going to stay at your house so I can tell you that we can't associate 🤣🤣 / []
It says volumes...how much British  manipulated wars, illegal behavior, salvery and still uphold the status of being royal. / ['Well you’re wrong about slavery in the relation to British. Believe it or not, the British are one of the main reasons slavery doesn’t exist today. It was during the reign of George III that Britain began a crusade against slavery across the world, sacrificing many relationships with other European powers in the process.']
Every single member of the royal family is exactly the same, all are deplorable and pure evil. / []
What bull shit. Excellent interview. / []
Half of the U.S. voted for Trump. The actual co defendant of Epstein. It's little wonder we can't get justice for kids. / []
His anger and frustration behind his interview mask was pretty obvious, guilty your honor. / []
A very royal scandal did her dirty with the deep voice. The actress was terrible / ['I thought she was great.', '@letolethe3344 the script for some reason seemed like a play on how many swear words they could fit in. And I really don’t get the deep voice…I had to come back to this video to see if it was that deep. Which it really isn’t']
A guilty & cowardly pedophile who hides behind his royalty & wealth. / []
"cosmopolitan group" of pedos. But the most hilarious are the tone deaf comments "It wasn't a party, it was a shooting weekend, a straightforward shooting weekend." and "It was only a small party, 8 or 10 people." / []
who else is here after A very English scandal? Michael Sheen is a chameleon / []
I think we need some sort of Gillian Anderson and Ruth Wilson actors-on-actors interview, I think we need a jacket here. / []
The craziest 49 minutes of Television ever. I can't imagine what his staff were thinking as they watched him deliver the least convincing lies ever recorded. / []
I am here because of 'A Very Royal Scandal' / []
I believe the dual lampshades know the truth of it all…….👀 / []
Bu çocuk tacirlerini niye içeri atmiyorlar 👎 / []
Amazon just release the show please!!! / []
He's part of that whole dirty, nasty, disgusting crew: Trump, Epstein, Andrew.... / []
Going to Jeffrey's was not about parting, absolutely not  It was about having sex and abusing under age girls / []
Has newsnight interviewed Trump? Can this woman do it? / ['God bless president trump ❤️']
I watched this after it first happened and again now - it’s even worse the 2nd time. He’s a total disaster / []
I want him to do a physical test on camera to see if he sweats - idiot / []
Moron, he’s not a good friend but I have to see him after not talking to him for 4years - to break up the friendship. Disgusting pig / []
watching this before a very royal scandal with michael sheen drops / []
Here’s the problem,….!You have to understand”……,your a nasty  little piece of work………..,bye bye.. / []
He reminds me of that uncle in Derby Girls / []
“Funny enough” / []
Oh it’s definitely me. But it’s not in London. When I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie. Those are my traveling clothes. 😅 / []
Is prince andrew on the spectrum? He’s super weird. Is he really saying that he wasn’t sweating at the time of 10th march a hundred years ago? 😅 like what the hell andrew hahahaha what are you on?? / []
Name? Prisoner Andrew. And your chosen specialised subject? Noy being at places with people i shouldnt have been with.   After that round,  you have scored 0 points. / []
Wow they allowed this interview to be released and he dug his own hole so bad😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
At the end...He doesn't regret the association with Epstein because there were some 'seriously beneficial outcomes' that have nothing to do with Epstein's crimes.  HE benefitted financially  I suppose, not British businesses. Pfft. / []
The scoop accuracy is insane / []
Now they should interview him again about his college friend Ghislaine! Would love to watch that interview 😂 / []
There's not one person besides the "teddy-bear prince" who believes this fairytale. / []
17 year olds are innocent just look at Southport inicdent / []
This should be studied in college as an example of digging yourself into a hole / []
“I wouldn't call him a friend” but also “its a sore in the family…we all knew him, its a constant gnaw” / []
clearly not telling the truth.. looks guilty.. boys will be boys😂 / []
Dumb as a rock / []
Even if he were innocent. I can’t stand the man. / []
I want to straighten his tie ! / []
4 yrs on he is still a Wally. An irrelevant man, pretty full of himself / []
suicidal interview / []
What a turd. / ["That's Prince Andrew mate"]
It's sickening. He doesn't look back on his relationship with Ebstein with regret.   Broke his mother's heart and humiliated his own daughters. What a joke, he should be in a US prison. / ['Yeah, but he learned shit, so it balances out.🙄🤣', 'It cheered him up when they talked about Epsteins death.', 'I suspect the Sussexes are an engineered smokescreen to shield the Royal Family\'s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. This Megxit is to steer the investigations away from the Royal Family\'s involvement with human trafficking. Notice the Megxit timing? Andrew\'s interview was in November 2019, and Megxit began in January 2020.\nAlso, why didn\'t Harry mention anything about Prince Andrew\'s friendship with Epstein and Maxwell in his "tell-all" book and interviews? That would have been the perfect information to add to make his family look bad.', 'Randy Andy will be all over Epstein files like his fellow rapist WOAT doofus Donnie', 'How do you know that he hurt his mother or embarrassed his daughters? Were you present when these events unfolded? Additionally, his mother did assist him in avoiding legal consequences by giving him a substantial sum of money, which suggests she may not be as devastated as implied.']
Pedophiles lie / []
30:23: Maitliss: "are you saying she is lying?" "Randy Andy: "That is difficult to answer". If you are not guilty, dude, she is lying. Not too hard to answer, unless you are lying. The world has decided since you were NOT an honorable man. / []
27:00 on Absolutely categorically "do not THINK I ever went upstairs"? Seriously, Maitliss di aa great job, but what assertion is this? Dig faster, Randy Andy. You're no through to China yet. / []
18:13: "(Jeffrey Epastein) He was in and out all over the place." No one could have said it better, Randy Andy, you idiot perv. / []
Vaughn Mall / []
His reply when asked how he met Epstein, tells me all I need to know about this sordid matter. He states he met him through his girlfriend rather than and stating that he met Epstein through ‘close personal friend Ghislane Maxwell’. / []
After all this time what has come of this or the evidence seized from Epstein's homes?  Other than Ghilaine's incarceration it seems this whole investigation has evaporated and no one else is being charged with any criminal activity.  WTF! / []
It hurts so bad when he talks... / []
How does he know the pic was taken upstairs if he never went upstairs? / ['People who analysed the photo have said it was taken upstairs']
Did his team set him up-surely they could not have thought this was a good idea 😂 / []
A normal person would admit they made a huge error in judgement- ask the common wealth for forgiveness. But they live in a total different universe. He also definitely slept with the girl. / []
Of course he won't remember her, he had so many. / []
The most convenient place for him to stay is in his brothers prison. Rent free. That's where he should be.... / []
20:26 i still cannot get over the pizza express in woking comment / ['why havent people investigate the pizza woking thing, they wold remember him being there']
He comes across as a pompous entitled buffoon.   He won’t be the first person famous or other wise  to have had sex with a young girl when it was offered on a plate.   He waffles so much and is so cringeworthy to watch…laughing in inappropriate places, constantly blurting out ‘funnily enough’,  nodding and saying ‘ yes’ to every point Matlis makes, trying to remember things by looking upward… 🤔….the ‘positive action’ comment…ffs, he should have simply answered yes, or no.   These protracted answers to simple questions were his downfall.  Talk about “me thinks he doth protest too much” / []
Years later and I still can’t believe he did this interview! Hope he gets the boot! / []
No sweat. / []
Perfect example when private education and privilege can’t save you / []
Can Em interview Harry and Meg please / []
An overdose of adreniline from being shot at, resulting in the inability to sweat. WOW 😂 / []
He has a remarkable ability to look like he's lying 100% of the time / ['This wit deserves more likes😂', 'Lmao yeah you can’t even trust ‘my name is Andrew’ cos of that face.', 'Sarcasm and wit is very funny when you use it like that🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣', 'This is what happens when you grow up in a society of privilege and people don’t challenge your bs', 'Bro deserving oscar for this!']
Is it only me that would love Ali G to do the next interview with Andrew ? If this was a game of hangman, he would literally be hung after the first 10 questions 🤦‍♂️ / []
Like really WHY would you stay with a convicted sex offender??? / ['Convenience, why else?', 'Probably to commit some sex offenses.']
Watching this interview after watching the movie blink twice is a whole different interview. / []
I mean at least he tries to lie well, but he's totally trash at it. Also, you can tell when he was like "Fuck, she got me" when he could pin point remember every irrelevant detail but "couldn't remember" AT ALL when faced with relevant stuff and she called him out for it right after. Lying is one thing, but lying as the Duke of York in such a serious situation and still be arrogant about it is just... wow. / []
You can tell when a creep gets busted they talk and act like this / ['whats my mum going to say about this']
So he was never close with Epstein, only "his girlfriend", but he felt the need to meet him to tell him face-to-face that he had to break up their friendship...  MKAY / []
The girl in photo looked like she was having a good time with a prince she's not  a child and did not look like she dint want to be there now she's older she's using it to get money if u was a victim u would want justice and not drop charges after a pay out / ["Anyone that has been trafficked against their will would play nice so they don't get raped/murdered. what kind of logic is that?", "@Stormcrow113 she dint look like some1 who didn't want to be there and why take a pay out surely if that did happen u would want justice", "In the photo does it look like she doesn't want to be there? \u200b@kylebrown6798", 'Clear example of uneducated opinions. Abuse looks like that too.']
Excellent interview now can Charles be questioned over involvement with Jimmy Saville / []
This is why i wish we had a crown season 7 and 8. Id love to see the queen and Now king react to this / []
Wie viel Milliarden zahlt ihr Engländer jedes Jahr für diese Idioten 🤔 / []
He wasn't a good friend but he offered you his house when he wasn't present. Lying scumbag alert / []
I keep returning to this gem / ['Same here. The journalist is brilliant! Spot on and killing softly Andrew.']
ok guys dont waste your time. i will summarize the whoşe interview. basically, he was so high he doesnt recollect anything. and yes sorry. he has a medical condition that he cant sweat. / []
take it this way. what if charles died before getting married. this goon would be your king / ['Not how that works. look it up.', "\u200b@Stormcrow113 That is how it works though. Andrew was second in line until William and Harry were born. Now those two have children of their own he's been pushed further and further down the list, but if Charles had died young we'd have King Andrew now.", "@BobSmith-s7j Okay you lost me I assumed you meant Camilla and not Diana. By that logic if a caveman didn't bust a nut into that hot women he saw the human race would not have come into prevalence, seems pointless to have what if's."]
He gives me the creeps / []
This guy is scum, but didn't the BBC cover for Jimmy Saville for decades? / ["Exactly. Ultimately its up the citizens to uphold the right and wrong of the world and always remember the media is just a moral empty mirror that reflects whatever will get them views or privilege's."]
The thought of a lady of any age having to see Andrew naked is disgusting in and of itself / []
So interesting when Brockman is mentioned, he goes wide-eyed with a sudden panic initially, before going back to I don't know him. He clearly did know him. / []
Andrew just revealed a lot in this line ...... ".............He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together and that's the bit that I remember is going to the dinner parties where you would meet ACADEMICS, POLITICIANS , PEOPLE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS  I mean it was a cosmopolitan group of what I would  describe as US eminence ....."  WHO ARE THESE POLITICIANS , ACADEMICS , PEOPLE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS AND "U.S EMINANCE" ?????  WE WANT NAMES !!!!  WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE AND WHAT WERE THEY DOING HANGING WITH EPSTEIN ? / []
' I don't know how *did I collect this reputation*'- that, early on in the interview tells you anything you need to know. He was demolished by Maitlis. What an extremely skilled, fair interview. He did it all to himself. If you didn't know about his involvement, now you do. What an incredible piece of journalism. Thank you Ms Maitlis and the entire production team. A new standard. / []
Watch this interview with the sound turned off. You won't hear the conversation, but you sure as hell will  know he is lying about something, the lack of eye contact, says a lot . / []
Let’s say he is innocent as a newborn lamb, ‘awkwardly’ he does an absolutely fantastic job in looking suspicious af ……..😒 / []
Low IQ  farmer / []
Thank you, I needed a good laugh today.  The original is even better than the version in the documentary. / []
Liar and not smart, to say the least. Royal family, what a surprise / []
Liar / ['Bro didnt answer a single question with a straight answer💀 he reminds me of when ur a kid and you are definitely guilty but you think you can lie your way out of it. What a complete spoon', '@mathiasstrom7790 You don\'t think answering "No" to yes/no questions is a straight answer?']
So he pays 12 million pounds to pay her off ( you mean us the tax payers paid this for his crimes( secondly he has a medical condition never sweats ,( really there are pictures of him sweating like a pig,,,,thirdly he never knew that woman it wasn’t him putting his arm round her ,,lies lies the tax payers money,,,he sold his chateau to pay her off ( no you sold our chateau to pay her off ,,,.he never party’s that’s crap to ,,,it’s all lies total crap he’s a disgrace shouldn’t be called a prince,,,,listen we all make mistakes but it’s the lies ,,,now if I pulled a seventeen year old ( it’s legal) and shafter her i would love it ,,, / ['Your right it’s our money']
Ive only just noticed what a useless twit he is at tying his tie.. / []
I Always wonder how the Brits can stand a royal family useful just to create mess and tabloid contents. You don't need to be an expert to know he's fake / []
48:05 / []
Let’s face it. Queen Liz did a miserable job at raising children. True the servants were there but Charles and him are awful. Why the English love them beats me. I say English specifically. Welsh and the Scots could care less. It’s time for them to go. / ['Opinion polling shows majority supoort for the monarchy in England and Wales, maybe 60% or so. Scottish support is weaker but still maybe 45% in favour. I say this as someone who wants a republic myself and would rather support was 0% across the UK. But the whole "English bad, Scots and Welsh good" meme is misleading because the picture is a lot more complicated. Just on population size, more Brits who want rid of the monarchy are English than live in Wales and Scotland put together.', '@BobSmith-s7j the welsh are lovely people that’s why. They don’t make waves. I want Scotland to be free. Lol. And i would get rid of the aristocracy. All estates nationalized. Lol. Allow King Charles to finish. His duchy though nationalized, the $ goes for something meaningful better health care or something. Lol. The German windsors are horrible. Just horrible. Lol.', 'Her majesty did a great job for her family and country god rest her soul ❤️', '@ChrisDWXX She was a useless relic of a horrific colonial past.']
Interviewer: “you were there to catch up with friends?” Andrew: “impossible. I have no friends” Interviewer: “Why not?” Andrew: “well I’m a sex offen… shit.” Interviewer: “gotcha”. / ['Ladies and gentlemen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*WE GOT HIM*']
Neck fat has a life of its own / []
Andy and  Terror are really twin flames. I loved when she tri d to set Andy up behind his back to make friends with an Arab for what 500,000? Cigarette in one hand. Glass of wine in the other. Bag of money. I really wonder about Eugenie and  Beatrice. William and Catherine keep their distande. Catherine never buddies with them. Andy and Carrie soul mates. Now they're being kicked out of Royal lodge. I don't feel bqd. / []
His neck fat has a higher IQ than him. Just disappear weirdo. I love how his like I'm actually lifelong friends with Ghoslaine. Not really epstein. Now she is sitting in prison and he looks like an idiot. This pains knows all the men involved bit because of their wealth and power aren't going to prisom. It really is bs. Sick evil people that should be in prison. / []
How the hell did he think he come out looking good after this interview with this incompetence . / []
I love how she just keeps repeating the accusations to see him squirm / []
Surely there are medical records saying he can’t sweat if that’s the case / []
Would the pizza place not have surveillance footage of him if he was there that night? / ["The claimed trip to Pizza Express was on 10 March 2001 and this interview happened in 2019. They're not going to have kept surveillance footage from that long ago. Fortunately he does provide the opportunity to ask other witnesses, since he claims to have been there for a specific birthday party for a friend of his daughter, and lots of other parents were present. No one else seems to remember seeing him there."]
The fact that he kept stuttering and repeating himself lets you know all that you need to know. / []
"You're 'friend' suggested that that photo is fake".  Solid legal ground for doubt of the authenticity of the photo, "friend" ! / []
There is ZERO need for a Royal Family in the UK. King Charles is 19% English. It is a complete and utter waste of money that should be applied to the benefit of the population and the future of the British Isles. Royal Families are an archaic nonsense from history. / []
I wish she asked him if he’d be willing to take a polygraph (and maybe say the accuser is willing). / []
This interviewer is brilliant! She gets him to dig his hole deeper each time / []
36:50 - Sweating much? / []
27:40 - the shaking of his head while answering yes, and then nodding is the sure giveaway of a lie / []
What a crock of poop! He is lying thru his teeth.  To think he was allowed to be with royalty and they didn't know what was going is crazy. He should be living with common people and get a job!!! / []
Prince Andrew is a sexual predator who should never be in the public eye again / []
Just found this gem / []
<<When i first saw Virginia's allegation that I r*ped her I thought "hmm that's weird, I don't remember that">>  Yeah, sounds reasonable 🙄 imagine being one of the girls... / []
Iits my belief that i am a missing person from Saudi Arabia as king Faisals daughter and have long been asking questions about my past and real name and identitys and real birthdates and haveots of unanswered Questions about my past along with king Faisals plane loads of missing foreign peoples kidnapped and abducted and sex trafficked kids by spiridon putin or Albert Putin that i was sex trafficked to many places to get away from my real daddy king Faisal that got king Faisal assassinated that i have been a missing person for the last 55.years  living under some assumed  faked counterfeit forged names and identitys and different birthdates / []

After seeing Her Majesty the Queen of England in Memphis Tennessee dressed in plain clothes for Christmas or soon after i sent Her Majesty the Queen of England and Mr Phillip and Andy and Charlie and Anne and Edward a beautiful present portrait of me dressed as the Queen of England as king Faisals daughter to Buckingham Palace that had a mate of Andy as the king of England that went with the King Faisals daughter as The Queen of England as andy the king of my heart ❤ from years ago as king Faisals daughter before i became tangled un in a international sex trafficking organization like Jeffery eupstine orgies Island inside the United States of America tbat may of got my real daddy king Faisal assassinated as he was chasing me around the whole to get me out of a international sex trafficking ring from Saudi Arabia to Iraq to Afghanistan to Russia to Germany to Washington DC to the florence ala areas that i do not even had the same name and identitys and different birthdates that was faked and forged and counterfeited from Howell Heflin Doug Jones and Jeff sessions offices that i had several mental adjustments of cold war either drops and ghb and electric shocks reprogramming therapies treatments over the last 55.years of being in a sex trafficking ring / []
Its my belief that Elizabeth and andy might of been to see Graceland years ago when i almost thought the i seen Her Majesty the Queen of England as she walked by  and boarded a tour bus that they said it was a tour bus of London England  that sometimes i belive tbat Her Majesty the Queen of England wanted to say Hello and so we meet again at Graceland of Elvis Presleies Graceland in Memphis Tennessee and had found me as king Faisals sex trafficking daughter that she had not seen in over 55.years that was under a different name and identitys and faked counterfeit forged documents that lives in the florence ala areas of king Faisals plane loads of missing foreign kidnapped and abducted and sex trafficked kids victims / []
Andy looks like hes had mental adjustments from mi5 and mi6 after hes gone to sleep he looks confused like he can't remember / []
How to destroy your existence in an interview 😂 / []
He never shows any empathy or even acknowledges that there are victims / ['Its because he doesnt have any empathy. He genuinely just doesnt understand what empathy even is because he clearly never learnt it \nNot very shocking considering he is royalty', 'People in power don’t care about anyone but themselves. And when they act like it, it’s only for the publicity', "@Beckyhit Yes it's called narcissism."]
“He was in and out all over the place…”. 😜 / []
It was a convenient place to stay while telling him I couldn’t see him in person - I had to make sure he was sex trafficking by having some sex with trafficked girls - yup - he was trafficking-  I got some great foot massages from Russian girls - diddled a few of them as it was a convenient thing to do and a convenient way to decide that he was providing girls to me for a guaranteed yes for sex. / []
I went there in person to tell him I couldn’t see him in person - by telephone is for chicken’s - sounds like Prince respected him a lot - Prince never came to me to tell me he can’t see me in person and I’m not even a trafficker ! / []
The queens advisors realised he mustn't go to court as he would be proven as guilty as sin. / []
I don’t know if I believe him or not. The girl was extremely specific, almost too specific, in her story. I question if she saw a big payday. 31:51 / []
Yall must really be running out of ideas if youre turning this into a 2 season series 😂 / []
The monarchy is a pathetic idea and the people who worship them are delusional. Just look at this Andrew guy. No difference from your run of the mill child molester. / []
Guilty, guilty guilty / []
You met.young ladies / []
Yes!!!!!!! He is a boy!!But he disgusting..... / []
Has king Salman been looking for king Faisal daughter though Jeffery eupstine sex trafficking organization from mi5 And mi6  and from Buckingham Palace with Charlie and Andy and Anne from the dayz of king Faisal when king Faisal traveled with his daughter caught up in sex trafficking / []
In the film clip andy looks like hes and some mental adjustments that he can't remember / []
Andrew made this interview seem like a movie…. 😂😂😂 / []
He did manage the first 1 min 14 seconds well tbf / []
Pinochio / []
I never thought another Royal could do a more train wreck interview this. Didn't think it would ever be possible. Or fergie in negotiations with an Arab to sell Andy. With her cigarette in one hand, a glass of wine in the other and a case full of cash. Lol. Thought I'd never see anything that could top that moment. Boy was I wrong.   Harry and Meghan ....hold my beer!!!!?....... Who would have ever thought it would get weirder. Im mean that phone.call between Kong Charles telling Camilla he wants.to be.a.ta!pin so he can be.inside her all the time.  That was really invading privacy. Also those Squidgy phone.calls taped on Diana. The harkles media pre Oprah was still really good. They opened their mouths on purpose being crazy in front of 17 million people. Harry chose to write about putting mommy lotion on his blue oscillating todger while thinking of his mother. I mean.  The harkles actually put in so much effort into making the!selves look like lunatics. / []
Is he really that stupid---hard to believe--when brains were being handed out he must have been missed!! / []
Pobriño es tan machote que lo hace cara  a cara que fue verlo,yo estaba  en medio de la entrevista de Netflix y vine a YouTube 😅para ver lo sinvergüenza que miente  tráfico de menores para prostitución asta ña corbata 👔  la tie delado / []
The look on his face at 13:51 says it all when asked about whether he gave a young Russian woman a foot massage.   Nothing more to be said from my perspective. / []
Did he get no prep?? This is insanely awful. Dude's tie isn't even straight / []
Do you regret being friends with a vile monster who sexually abused vulnerable children? Prince Andrew: no, because I got lots of opportunities and I learnt a lot from him.  Jesus Christ 🤯 / []
He paid off Virginia, why? / []
Vile, hope stupid are the British? / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
If VR was saying in court that she had sex with him 3 times, and he bluntly denies that it happened, why won’t he say that she’s lying?  “She says this happened”  “That didn’t happen”  “Is she lying then?”  “Well…….i can’t say blahdyblahblahblahl.” / ["Right, because she could be mistaken. People who say things that aren't true aren't always lying."]
What madness is this pure stupidity caught red handed 😂😀😃😠 / []
Just watched the scoop on Netflix and it’s crazyyyyy how much the actors look like the characters. / []
Is of zero insterest nowadays, the point here is the girl was recruited in a MAR A LAGO restroom, this one presented in London, and the happy owner of the MAR A LAGO nightclub and residence pushes for world power in november. / []
He should be in jail / ['He wont be', '@mathiasstrom7790 well go clean his sweaty undies then']
He must be so bored to be flying to NY to hang out with a NOT SO CLOSE FRIEND. I am glad that they let him finally get into trouble. Although neber went to prison. Which is crap.anyways.  which is i guess the perks u get being the royal family. / []
Blink rate is off the scale / []
Emily Maitlis is the woman who brought down Prince Andrew in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and won Virginia Guiffre £12m,  $16.3 million after this interview. Actually, it was Andrew's hubris and sense of entitlement that brought him down.  https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?si=_pU72g7RCvXptxFW / []
You can feel she is absolutely disgusted by this guy. / []
Hang on, so as soon as he was convicted Andy decided to not stay in touch. but as soon as he was released Andy decided that he should meet him and tell him in person - we cant be in touch. 4 years is a long period for a man to figure that out and wouldnt be his top concern, given it is a considerable stretch to call him a good friend. / []
is she lying  i dont remember hehe / []
IN SAINSBURY PRINCE ANDREW / []
Convenient place to stay, your judgment was “ I need the young things”! / []
He took the judgment call to go see his friend and get laid by little girls! / []
This Andrew kid should run for Congress / []
He lied through his teeth, tripping over every word like a coward. What a sad excuse for a human being! / []
The Royal Family Press Release ...  The Firm has no knowledge of anyone named Andrew . And any further questions ... Please direct your Questions to the closest trash receptacle as "The Firm" has done with the above mentioned non person . / []
All in the best possible TASTE eh Charlie ??  THY WILLS  BE DONE  😂😂 / []
"I have absolutely no recollection" (while he describes the layout of the house) / []
An extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together!  And what had they all got in common?  Perhaps they all had the same kink? / []
How has he never been charged with ANYTHING? / ['He is literally above the law. Technically he isnt but in reality he holds so much power he can get away with anything. Money and influence is power, not abstract political positions', '@mathiasstrom7790 It might be lack of evidence though.', "What specific criminal offence would you charge him with please? Virginia was 17 so above the age of consent when the alleged encounter happened but the most likely criminality relates to her, a minor, being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell. Andrew could be charged with being party to that trafficking but it's not clear that there is sufficient evidence at this remove for him to be proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Could the prosecution prove for example that he knew she had been trafficked, rather than having travelled voluntarily with Epstein and Maxwell? The guy is a disgrace but you have to look at the actual law on sexual offences and how things would go in court.", 'He is from a Country ,my Country also ,where powerful people with influence like Jimmy Saville got away with what he did & never got caught until after his death really.']
Mygod wat a lies / []
Lies / []
This criminal and the entire monarchy should be cancelled! Shame on the UK and its corrupt institutions. / []
Transitioning out of the navy? There's no such thing. You eitber work for the navy or you don't. That one phrase proves what a div he really is. / ['He makes reference to being on "terminal leave". People leave jobs where they\'ve had their last day at work but are still on the payroll as they take unused holiday, so it could be that. But he is still a div.']
He’s a evil incarnate spoiled child 😵‍💫 / []
Holy crap. I have heard this was a disaster, but it's almost a parody. / []
Just think that the likes of this man are supported by taxpayers money and the same taxpayers are denied basic services because of cuts to public spending / []
His face when she mentions John brocken is the cherry on the cake / []
I have no recollection..this is regarding,him having sex with a person !!!!! notice, not, absolutely untrue…. If the accusation was…” you drove a yellow three wheeler reliant regal down pall pall, wearing only a pair of boxers and a bowler hat” his response would surely be , “absolutely not”….says it all really, but, I do feel, that given the allegations of similarly powerful people being present at Jeffreys homes…. Andrew has been thrown to the wolves, but these must be mighty powerful people, if a member of the British royal family has had to take a fall, and a mighty big one at that…. / []
Who ever let him do this interview clearly doesn't like him lol he comes off as not only a liar but a child level liar .. dudes a pedophile just like Jeff .. next question please.. / []
He's as guilty As syntax ... 😂😂 / []
He's as guilty As synagogue ...😂😂 / []
🐺🐺🐺🐺 / []
😂 his nervous stutter is hilarious, BU-BU-BU-BUT, i-I-I-I, SU-SU--SU-SURE. Prince Andrew is definitely a character, his ability to lie on command is uncanny, he's such a weirdo. / []
Dude this guy is completely fuckin soulless it’s kinda scary looking into his morbid face. / []
Stunning that he would give this interview at all. Anyone would know to shut the hell up, unless compelled by court order/subpoena to testify. Just astounding. / []
Why did he give  V dufray 12 million ?, jokers are wild!😂 / []
And you still voted for trump, wtf / []
He says he has gone over and over and over a thousand times to try and remember he had sex with her and he is sure he hasn’t.. I mean.. if you have to go over and over for thousands of times to dig your memories would mean he’s been with lots and lots of women 😅 / []
He belonged to a very secret but large club of wealthy men and women who are sexual predators and Pedophiles. They had a big problem when Jeffrey was arrested. Then they got rid of the problem. They have so much power and so much wealth they pay off law enforcement agencies to protect them. This club is wide spread and full of politicians and actors and other important people. Their Child Trafficking has grown so large they have a "Breeding Facility" to make their own victims. / []
He is very good  at getting out of answering the question!! / []
12:11 “it was a convenient place to stay”   In all of NYC?  No lavish hotel?  No luxury private rented pad?  😅😅😅 / []
What a piece of work / []
I bet Emily thought hours about Andrew's account and still couldn't fathom the choice of his wording, the oddly specific memories that were insignificant to his defence, his description of Epstein as if he were still his dear friend of 50+ years, his facial expressions, his actual defence (or lack there of).   I would've been awake for 48 hours straight trying to find some sort of cosmic trick or cunning interpretations that Andrew may have placed in the interview to disparage me in some way or his lawyers' intentions, and that I was the one who was tricked or ruined... and yet here it is, a televised footage of someone aiming at people appalled by him, through his own head 😂😂😂 / []
“Unbecoming”, says it all, FFS. / []
Rule brittania, but let's let this one go, say whot. Let the side down, got caught with pants down and made a right muck of things. That's not cricket, what will the people think. Oh dear they know, blast that social media, don't we own them yet??!!. / []
Gillian classed this lady, WAY the hell uppp! 😂 / []
this interview was definitely set up he's made to look pleasant this shit head should be thrown in jail and the key thrown away / []
Now that the southport attcaks were done by a 17 year old hopefully ppl realise thye arent innocent. / []
I like how in the movie “Scoop” they pronounce the bar Tramp as Trump. What a disingenuous movie. / []
So... He had to drive his daughter, a princess, to Woking. No chauffeur available?? What did he do, sit in the car and wait for her?? / []
Never gets old 😂😂😂 / ['🤣👍🏻']
DONT EVER CALL HIM SIR. NOTHING HONOURABLE ABOUT THEM / ['The guy has a massive ego and it was very helpful to the interview that Maitlis was able to butter him up this way so he would happily dig his own grave on camera']
A multi millionaire as now were else to stay apart from child abuser's house😡🤦😡💁😡⚖️ / ['Pretty sure the royals have private residences in New York anyway. Charles owns about 10 different properties there.']
Who in their right mind tell you to go an see a peodo 😮 Total BS / ['so you think the southport attcaker was innocent child/']
I come here time and time again to have a belly laugh! Take the shame, Andy! 😂 / []
Scumbirds of a feather flock together ......... / []
He says that he continued his association with Epstein because of the people E could introduce him to that he could learn from. As if a member of the royal family wouldn't have access to whomever he wants at any time! You don't need Epstein for that. Also, trying to claim that he was friends with Epstein as an offshoot of his friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell is absurd! She's as crooked and revolting as Epstein! / []
He make the same faces like Ted Bundy when he was Interviewed, showing that’s he is lying / []
I remember someone pointing out that he comes across as very unintelligent, and that changed my perception of people from his background forever / []
Cosmopolitans group of eminence that Epstein could bring together. When you mean pedofiles like Bill Gates, yourself, etc… and you get away with it… / []
😂😂😂😂😂no wonder why he paid.stfu..Jesus,telling us you're guilty while deflecting guilt is a funny to hear and watch!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
If he lived in America he would 1 million percent be a Democrat / ["That's funny, Trump Epstein and Andrew all knew each other", "@sayno2lolzisback and then when you look in the black book 10000 other people also knew him but they didn't hang out with them and do the sexual deviant s*** that your Democrats did you sound like a racist piece of garbage let me guess did you vote for dementia Joe and now you're going to vote for Kamala Harris because you think she's black she's an Indian dingbat she couldn't run a high school play let alone the United States of America you people are f****** delusional", '@sayno2lolzisback and I could name a thousand Democrats that knew him and flew on the plane Bill Clinton he flew on the plane 27 times matter of fact it was a picture of him and Hillary in his living room lol dumbass', "@sayno2lolzisback Most of the people in his 'black book' are registered democrats."]
Never seen again / []
How do I move away from this? I work with minors from 7-14 years old and 5-95 world wide 🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
"I would remember it, because sex is a nice thing to remember"  His defence. Let that sink in. / ['Gross']
“It was inappropriate for us to be SEEN together “ NOT that what Epstein did was atrocious!  How many more times did he go there when he was not “seen!” / []
Other then Andrew, Who was maxwell trafficking to ?  Why are people not asking for that list ? / []
God's Plan . / []
Dude sounds like a lie    He has money  he didn’t need to stay   And we have telephones    He could have called or just not answer / []
You are a bad man / []
This is why we don't need a royal family. No one is above others. Certainly the 'royals' aren't above others. / []
First he was never friends with him directly, he was always the “plus one”, secondly he stayed at many of his properties, he never went upstairs, but stayed at Epstein’s many homes, he then flew to tell him they could not remain in contact (cos he couldn’t tell him over the phone)… #doh! / []
Lažeš stari moj...kako si dug i širok .....🤡 / []
I’ll never understand why he was the late Queen’s favorite son. / []
i wonder about you sometimes andrew you may fold under questioning / []
He should have been a man and took what was coming to him and done his porridge.Instead the spineless piece of shit went running to mummy to bail him out. And she’s just as bad for doing it. Scumbag family! / []
Creepy pedophile got away bc of who his Mommy is. Freaking sicko. How much more can this royal family do to keep making the people of the UK look stupid, and their idiot asses keep giving them their money and supporting them. This family would have nothing if it wasn’t for the people yet this family is their royalty. SMH. Shame on everyone of them / []
As he said he couldn't sweat he realizes we could see him doing just that, so he flipped it to "at the time, I couldnt sweat." WOWWWWWWW.... / []
So, I'm here after watching Scoop. I am wondering, did the BBC still fire people after this story, as shown in the movie? / []
The only honest piece of work bbc has ever done / []
O dear andrew how do you know the photo is upstairs how would you know what upstairs looks like you really are a pea brain its going to be so much fun seeing you at gitmo in the morning silly wabbit we seen all your phtos i cant wait to hear why you was on the island for two weeks was it to tell jeff you not want tobe fwends nomore hahaha theres so many photos even 1 with a towel on plonker / []
0:10 “Today, you have chosen to speak out. Why have you decided to talk now?”  Answer: I’m going to try out my lies, see how well they work, and hopefully i can control the situation before the shit hits the fan. And i’m sure the audience is dumb enough to believe my lies… / []
She played it like a boss. First asked him standard chit chat questions to show the baseline of his behaviour to the public. Then she grilled him and the contrast in his body language just says it all. Absolute SAVAGE! / []
The shaggy song it wasnt me for an hour / []
Don´t get me wrong, I loath this fellow and all that Epstein did and should have the book thrown at them. However, at the time Virginia was 17, the age of consent is 16 so she was not a minor. / ['She was a minor but above the age of consent. The two concepts are not synonymous in most jurisdictions.']
Liar  liar  pants on fire    😂 / []
Oh he’s a collaborator. What a scum bag / []
The most disgracing interview of all time. He went to NY to make sure Epstein won't talk about him. Talking about western democracy, what a hypocrisy, "elite" and establishment is far above anyone else. This man needs to be in jail. / []
What a crock of s _ _ _ he is. / []
There is something diplomatical about this whole interview. You’ve got the feeling that they’re trying to hide something. What that is better remains undiscussed..😮 / []
Why is Andrew not in prison… 🤬 / []
Why would a royal hang out with that kind of person knowing what this man was doing, andrew had sex with those young girls and so did all the men that was hanging with that epstein guy, bull, you know and we know you had sex with those young girls, kc should throw his but out on the streets and give him a card board box so he can sleep on, he should be in prisob, but noooooo, he mum protected him from that, that's why he didn't come back to the states, he knew he was going to jail, and i can't believe the other from the black book  has not been called out, but they will pay, and the womens, oprah, cameron diaz and many more, they knew what was going on, the pure  oprah winfrey, and turn  their heads the other way, where was the protection for those kids. / []
He just keeps saying the "UNITED STATES" / []
Astonishing that he and his advisers agreed to this interview. Best thing to do, especially of you are guilty, is to keep quiet. Not to give an interview to anyone, no matter what they promise you. Most of these interviews only hurt the interviewee and the news media obviously will benefit from it / []
I also think it's hilarious how he kept saying he was not friends with Epstein but his girlfriend and she ended up being as guilty if not more as Epstein / []
What a bloody idiot, I think it's a crime he is not in jail!!! Being stripped of his titles and duties is NOT ENOUGH / []
“I would go to stay at his house because of his girlfriend not because of him.” But earlier he said he stayed at his house because it was “convenient” for him to do so. He is clearly lying to dodge the truth. He facilitated in Epstein’s endeavors. He may be just as malicious as Epstein and is attempting to hide a dark truth. / []
I quite possibly did or did not meet that girl, but it's impossible because I know what the upstairs looks like since I've never been up there. Simple as that. / []
What a piece of 💩… the police should have been on standby to arrest him there is enough evidence there to charge him !!! / []
I remember woking specifically as its something I wouldn't usually do......did you bang under age girls?? I dont recall..... / []
It was a convenient place to stay , I bet it was ...lol / []
Amazing how he remembers the exact date when he was at Pizza Express..I barely remember yesterday ffs..lies Andrew..it certainly wasn't me sweating over an underage girl because I didnt sweat then because of the inner trauma I had after I served in the military..and it wasnt my hand it may have been me but it wasnt me..ffs Andrew you were there and you did do it / []
He’s lying through his teeth! / []
Law of God says 16, USA fail in bid to kill Andrew. / []
Having no recollection of committing the crime doesn't work for peasants. Of course if you are an illegal immigrant you can commit as many knife crimes as you like, just say that you are mentally unstable and you can stay in the country with everything paid for. Sorry for the off-topic rant! / []
What an amusing, perfect example of a BAD SHAMELESS L!ER . THEY ALL ARE . / []
Selective memory at its best😅. I don't sweat but im starting to sweat more recently 😂😂😂 / []
Painful / []
A bit thick / []
En toevallig kon hij niet zweten? / []

Just watched Scoop on Netflix ❤❤❤ / []
Came here to see if there were any marmalade sandwiches left. / []
props to the interviewer for staying calm bc i’m fuming / []
“My judgement was colored by my tendency to be too honorable” - dude. Seriously ?? are you f*** kidding me? / []
shes as guilty as he is. its the bbc. / []
BRUH YOU DONE GOT CAUGHT / []
10:17 - 10:21  he slipped up and said “What I was doing” / []
He is a lier / []
He claims he wasn't a friend. Then Epstein gets convicted, and eventually is released. Then Andrew goes to see him.  Yes, that's what people who aren't friends do. / []
This is proof that even royaltry can be trash... / []
Him complaining about social media and saying you have to face things now in regard to that, that u didn't have to face 25 years ago because of social media.. YES Andrew you've to face accountability because you can't control people like you use to be able to control the print media!!! / []
Anyone else distracted by his teeth?  That said, no surprises there by his arrogance or presumptions that he could lie his way out of this. 🫣 / []
I can’t listen to this idiot / []
Andrew loves  very young kids / []
13:41 "Really"😅😅😅 / []
Dwight: "I KNOW you're telling the truth, I can tell." / []
I DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE DOING NOW / []
A Filipino feet look just like for chicken 🐔  I'm going to take some pictures of some of that is here❤😂🎉 / []
What a train wreck of an interview, it's just cringeworthy!  The interviewer did an excellent job by allowing Andrew to dig his own grave.  She would not allow him to sway away from the questions.  Good grief, his spiel about his "sweating illness" caused by his "overdose of adrenalin" is nothing but stupid, along with everything else he spewed out of his mouth.   Did anyone count how many times he said ummm? / []
ANDREW and is teddy bears on is bed, around fifty of them and have to be in correct order on bed, and leaves a picture fore is slave servants to make shore it’s done right of the arrangement of teddy,s, and at the same time a sex offender who pays young girls off to keep quiet😊, lock this Royal ASS UP😊😊😊well that’s Stange I do not remember this , what a joke this man is / []
So you learnt something from Trump Andi..? How to LIE trough your fowl mouth...😮 / []
It ws a convenient place to stay.. Yes I bet it was / []
Exstaordinry how he could bring together other high profile pedophiles. He had all this money 💰 🤑 💸 😂.  Mostly blackmail dollars 💸 💵 💲. Hoo how very charming / []
IF INNOCENT YOU CANT BE GUILITY BY SOMEONES ELSES BEHAVOUR IF YOU GENUALLY DONT KNOW / []
with his huge financial resources, why can't he stay in a HOTEL - I 'm pretty sure they would have given him the best suite in the hotel...! / []
I thought it when I first saw it and still think that Emily did a brilliant job and stuck with the right questions,  she persists even though Andrew attempted to move on many times, she deserved every penny she earned that day,  brilliant interview. / []
Porque no pago carcer como pederasta ?. Al final será verdad que tiene. La sangre azul y son  seres divinos. / []

You can see on the photo between there bodies that his arm his extended to the hand around the waist also there was nobody else there if you look in the reflection of the glass / []
Scum!!! / []
Why is this guy not in jail? / ['His mummy rushed him back to buckingham and put a lid on it', 'What specific criminal offence would you charge him with, that could be proved in court beyond reasonable doubt?']
He has an app for 14-17 year olds? Lmao / []
So you had to go see him but you weren’t friends with him, you stayed in his house but only seen him twice over 4 days… we live in a sick world. Buckle up. I wonder if he remembers his old friend Rachel Chandler or not… / []
He gives me the creeps ! A grown man with 72 stuffed animals is red flag enough but the lies are so fantastic....he doesn't live in the real world.   How did he ever get anyone to marry him?   Yuck..I need to puke ! / []
Pathetic old pedophile / []
No matter how many times I watch this, prince Andrew is a dickhead. And more. / []
See I was in the UK so I had no idea what was happening with Epstein in the US. I only stayed there when I had business in the US / []
It's a bit of a stretch to say that's me in that picture with my hand on that 17 year old girl / []
That's impossible because I've never seen Jeffrey with a camera as it were / []
Telling him on the phone was the chicken's way out / []
I told him our relationship was over but decided to stay there for one more day / []
He said the picture was taking upstairs and he was never there. Then how did he know the picture was taken upstairs? / []
YOURE FUCKED WESTERN SUPREME COURT JUDGE ROBERTS-SMITH / []

Wow!  He considers himself to be honourable a person.🤨😂🤣😂🤣 / []
Madeline crow! / []
Adrenaline half-life 2-3 minutes!!! He’d been better off saying he suffered from post traumatic amnesia. / []
“Too honorable” 😂🤣😅 / []
I don't sweat 😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
If he never went upstairs how would he know that the photo was taken there? / []
Who else watched Scoop AND other docs/movies about this whole mess. I love it...and I don't really follow royalty stuff. :) / []
This guy is so  full of  himself and is ego is as acute as his amnesia. / []
It's like watching a train wreck. / []
He was on his plane, his private island and in all of his homes and had NO INDICATION of Epstein obsession with underage girls???? Amazing! 🙄🙄🙄🙄 / []
Andrew: "Listen Jeff, we can't be friends anymore but is it coo if I stay with you for 4 days?"  Jeff: "Of course!"  Andrew: "Splendid old chap! Massages?" / []
13:43 what a fanstastic landing! The eye shift is super inconspicous. Who let this dude go on TV? / []
10:57 - love the disparity between what he has absolute certainty on what he seems completely obvlivious to.   Seems conflicting Randy Andy! Or should I say, "convenient" like shacking up with Epstien. / []
2:55 - "Who me? No, no madame that's impossible you see becuase I suffer from a condition whereby I am completely devoid of the ability to party as a result of my heavy partying. So no." / []
Unbecoming?  He's a convicted sex offender. / []

Just by the nervous breaths that he takes you can tell he’s trying to hide something. What a slimy individual / []
Beast!!!!! / []
Check out the unsealed court documents from the epstein trials. / []
WOW sure it didn’t affect the Queen she paid 12 million dollars to this girl with probably the tax payer money she gets from the taxpayers / []
I don’t know why they do interviews with him because he’s not going to tell the truth and there still investigating this issue and he probably knows it The information is just now coming out / []
How does he know that it was upstairs if he hadn’t been up there? / []
What a liar So why did his mother pay a huge amount of money to a girl who accused him of wrong doing I don’t believe him / []
Excuses for bad behavior stayed with the disgusting man after he served time in prison for sex trafficking Andrew could have stayed anywhere else with the money he had he could afford to stay somewhere else / []
As I have explained? I don't actually know what I was saying 'producer play that back to me😊' / []
No bcos Virginia looked so much older than my daughters 😢 / []

The Pompous Prince and BBC are cut from the same cloth- just look at the history of both AND the vile "protected" abhorrent and ugly Eric Gill (self confessed sexual abuser of his own family and family pet) statue out the front of the BBC. An easy target to demolish, as the prince is spineless. privileged,  has no integrity and is morally bankrupt. The lies are laughable!! / []
Those little girls were wearing college hoodies when they boarded his plane. So to me there was no indication that he was a pedophile / []
It's a bit of a stretch to say I frequented the Island / []
This is almost better than the R. Kelly interview with Gayle King / []
So sick of these girls who have sex with men then call it sexual abuse years later. Both are guilty!! / []
Lying cues abound. Just had to say. / []
Imagine being so entitled, so narcissistic and just utterly stupid to actuallyn believe in any normal world that this was anything but a jaw dropping, embarrassing cringe- fest  tthat it was and will forever continue bto be! / []
Omg  Lie after lie / []
No one... believes you / []
LoL I don't sweat 😂😂😂 / []
A lie / []
OD of adrenaline so didnt sweat haha yea ok / []
trump was at partys with epstein no wonder he got assasinated😮 / []
He is so unreasonable. / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is the part where i don't think he can even delude himself / []
Andrew, just stop talking, you are digging a big hole for yourself / []
I'm really upset that The Crown on Netflix didn't do an episode of this. / ["The Crown is ultimately propaganda for the Royals so I'm not surprised, but very good point"]
He's trying to portrait an innocent guy, but he fails cause he's trying too hard. You can see he's uncomfortable. / []
I dont  remember...I dont remember / []
He comes across as a total privelidged SHIT!!! / []
I had pizza express in woking on 7th of September 2018, and I still have the receipt. I have no recollection of anything else though 😂 / ["It's even crazier, as the alleged Pizza Express night was 10 March 2001", '@BobSmith-s7j very memorable pizza experience I guess then']
Lock him up! / []
This happens When You have Subservient ( Most British ) mentality and Predisposicion. It doesn't help You allow DemonCrazy. Democracy to Govern your lives 🖕 / []
Who ever  advised him to do the interview knew exactly what they were doing 😂😂😂 / []
One minute he doesnt remember the next it didnt happen if contradiction was a person😂 / []
For a man who claims he likes engaging he sure contradicts himself 😂 / []
The only bit of respect Prince Andy ever got was his service in the brief Falkland war. He was looking for a time to conveniently slip that reminder in during the interview and it was just awkward and cringey. It bothers me that he thought for one second that would make this go away. / []
Absolutely NOT at all. Oh and I don’t sweat. I never went upstairs!  He must really think the entire world is made up of complete morons! How he thought this interview was a good idea defies any type of logic, or reasoning. Who could possibly believe all this incoherent nonsense? / []
i don't know where the bar is in tramps XDDDDDDDDd / []
A few years late he sould have been able to get away with it  becuise of A.I.. Maybe that's why they have not released the crimanals names  in the Epstein case except Andrew and Epstein girlfriend? / []
what a waste of breathing space that guy / []
You have to take some sort of positive action?? What?? What is he even saying!? / []
Every prince has a bad boy friend. ! 😂😂 / []
😅😂❤🎉 am afraid ❤😂🎉 / []
I watched this interview by this time when it was released now after Scoop again back to watch. / []
FAIL / []
OMG the waffle coming from him. It’s like answering an essay exam question you don’t know the answer too. I have a pain in my head after watching this. / []
You can tell he had some media coaching for the interview but isn't smart enough to make it seem believable. Because of his royal status at the time he can't simply blurt out, "I'm an idiot, that's why I stayed at Epstein's house for four days while breaking up with him even though we were more like acquaintances because of my friendship with his girlfriend...and I didn't have sex with the trafficked young woman and didn't see anything that made me think there was human trafficking because there was always people milling about in the house." Didn't he say at one point his problem was that he was "too courteous"? Ergo can't simply call someone who you kind of know because of their girlfriend and tell them that you can't hang with them because the are feeling sex traffickers. / []
Sounds categorically guilty, but there are more nuances to the truth. / []
Disgusting lying elitist hideous pig. / []
Little monster are ya / []
Stripping this man of titles does nothing to protect our children.   Prince Andrew has been paying people to bring him children for decades! / []
Body language is everything and trust me he's guilty. But people don't understand how powerful the royal family is, they basically can control anything and pay any amount of money to quiet someone. / []
HIs dry grassing on himself😂... I thought he was intelligent...😢😮😂 / []
Thank you very much indeed... I bet that's what you said to all the girls😂 / []
Get this man a shovel!!! / []
Oh my goodness this buffoon is as dumb as a stump. His arrogance knows no bounds. Tendency to be too honorable? Emily is absolutely brilliant. But Andrew's part is an absolute car crash. Couldn't sweat? Really? To quote Russell Howard " Bet he's sweating now!"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
"You had a party for him at sandringham..."  "Nooo, it was a shooting weekend." Durrr, well in that case.. 🤪🤪 / []
What a complete arse wipe / []
Him saying he didn’t meet her is probably true. He had so many disgusting encounters that he doesn’t know which girl that would be. / []
All those around these people created these entitlements! They created them the jay z, the puff diddys, michael jackson, clintons, this dude and so many many more who allowed them to have this power and to use in a destructive way. So everyone should be going after those who created these perverse people / []
"She said she you had sex with her three times" Prince Andrew " Well you see, there's a problem with that, I'm a woman" 😭 / []
Imangin he paid out all that 🤑💰 to someone he didn't know what a down Right Liar / []
The bullshit from him he always wears a suit when he in London ya right what a horrible man he was there and that's it lock 🔒🔐 him up.the.fool / []
Liar liars pants go on fire.....this guys pants do a full bon fire.. / []
I felt sorry for his mother. What a disappointment to her. Like her or not how many people do you know who continued to work into their 90s? She was a woman of substance. / []
My question is why he simply say he doesn't know Virginia Giuffre, instead of saying he doesn't remember to have ever met her. About the photo, he admits he is in that photo but, again, he doesn't remember to have posed for it, instead of saying he has never posed for that photo because he has never met Virginia Giuffre. / []
'4 times a year!!!' That look is priceless. / []
Can you imagine if a man like this was born first? / []
He's a pig. / []
Hes lying / []
Not the brightest of people is he. / []
Well, after this car crash, I'm not surprised the late Queen stripped him off, well, everything, bar his home, Royal Lodge. Thankfully the King is going to deal with that... situation.  Andrews friends say he "won't leave" and he wants to "leave it as an inheritance to his daughters", but it's a rental! How does he think he can bequeath something to his children that isn't actually his??? But, after watching this, I can see why he has that delulu idea in his obviously microscopic brain. The man got off lightly, so he should just fade quietly,  gratefully, into the background. Or oblivion. Personally, I'm not fussed which option he chooses, he just needs to choose.  Oh, this was just so painful to watch!🙈🙈🙈 / []
"His house was described as a railway station"...because you know, most homes have dozens of under-age girls entering and leaving on a daily basis. "You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on". This dude is an idiotic, egotistical blow-hard. Also, thinks the rest of us are idiots. Poor Prince Andrew - suffering mental health issues?! God bless the victims of these horrible predators. Epstein already got his just dessert. / []
Everything I find is that this guy is a slug of a human being and has been his whole life. / []
Boooo😮, layer 😮 what a compulsive lying 🤥 person 🎉 / []
Truth is the fact that the British Royal Family sells children born in Britain, particularly of mixt race bloodline genuine citizens who are born in Britain. 😢The British Royal Family are pimps pidophile ring and perpetrators to gain monies or land worldwide 😢. It is a fact, not fiction 😢! By fact, British people used to call in secret Elizabeth II Alexandra Mary "The Harlot"😢; because of selling children under 5 years old abroad for prostitutions purposes to gain them monies 😢! / []
The British Royal Family member Pidophile 😢. By Grace, fuck your own disabled daughter (s) instead of sexualy attack someone else child, you predator and perpetrator pig pimp!😢😅 / []
I have never enjoyed someone lying like i enjoy this pompous snake / []
I smell cloth burning. / []
Is he still a prince? / ['Yeah!,\nBut imagine somebody putting something away so it is never on display ,that has effectively happened to him', 'No']
The world has not been the same since this interview / []
Yes, I had to show leadership.  Oh Andrew go to Balmoral and disappear. / []
I think he is not telling the whole truth, but that picture looks fake to me. He should tower over her / []
Hard to watch him lie, very embarrassing. I'm literally cringing just by how he answers the questions. / []
Most rich people are scum / []
He's mumbling and his eyes are dripping / []
Beautiful send off for your mum shes in gods hands now. / []
The smaller girls were their children / []
I told you in a letter i wrote there was imposters. I was laced to forget / []
Properganda about you / []
Celebrity masks of you. Steven weldon had one. / []
Liar😂😂😂 / []
Absolute car crash / []
Theres a slight problem with the sweating....I didnt sweat at that time😂😂😂I have a peculiar medical conditon which caused me not to sweat😂😂this is comedy, he must think the world is this that stupid and naive to believe him.....I have absolutely no recollection of that photo ever being taken by epstien😂😂and here's the problem I have never seen epstien with a camera ever in my life😂😂 as if he's genuinely proving and disproving all the things 😂he must really believe that he's really disbunking all these😂😂you can be a royal because of blood but what a shame you can't be smart or intelligent by blood or from money 😂😂..."Noooou, absolutely No to all of it" "I have no idea,I don't recall or remember doing any of it" the Gaslighting is on God level😂😂 / ['With with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with the sweating 😂😂😂']
We should all smash like on this video so it spreads even more than it already has. / []
The British Royal Family is a joke! Now it’s one big dysfunctional family. / []
If he had been connected to a lie detector, it would have beee on fire!! The whole palace would have been on fire 😂😂😂 / []
What a fool. As a Canadian - get rid of the monarchy. / []
He was talking to much like boy you not even answering the question you just telling in yourself with other stuff / []
How can you be so rich with a smile so broke / []
He’s just a dirty old man!! Disgusting! / []
He didn't know the guy okay / []
absolutely hilarious / []
Uffff / []
He didn’t go into great depths about what I I mean what he was doing that’s a fraudulent slip. Cut to pays 12 million to the lady and gets stripped of his royal title. / []
“He never said nothing about it” is a double negative / []
Prince Andrew was a mooch and a  creeper. He trusted Epstein? / []
I have simply no recollection of ever posting a comment on this video / ['me 3', 'smell my sweat', 'I was in a pizza restaurant in Woking when I didn’t post this reply…', '@durrantalanI didn’t go upstairs to read your unposted reply']
“I don’t regret my friendship with Epstein because of all the girls I was allowed to touch” / []
Imagine having to address that as you're Royal Higness after, i would have coughed and said you're Royal Lieness / []
Dirty andy heres an idea dont speak / []
He loves to scream at his staff and his favkurite insult is " you fxcking buffoon" he called one of his staff " a lardy ass cxnt" he's disgusting and should be in prison. / []
I cannot believe he got away with it. Like yeah, he settled with Virginia but it's bullshit. / []
Emily did an incredible job! Andrew is one word - Pathetic! / []
randy andy, watched scoop then watched this in full and i genuinely beleive hes lying about most of what he said, i believe he joined in with epsteins activitys and therefore i believe Andrew is a sex offender  so many holes in Andrews story hes leaking like a colinder  questions like  'how can he claim to know the photo of him and the girl was taken upstairs in epsteins girlfriends house but yet then claim that he never went upstairs' like that doesnt make sense  deep down i beleive andrew was complicit in illegal sex activitys and therefore not only do i see andrew as a liar but i also seem his as a lying sexual devient  also claiming "it was convienent to stay at his home" thats bullshit, you got the money you could of gone to stay at a luxery hotel / []
Prince Andrew: No, I've no recollection of ever meeting her, I'm almost, in fact I'm convinced that I was never in Tramps with her. There are a number of things that are wrong with that story, one of which is that I don't know where the bar is in Tramps. I don't drink, I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there.   “Whenever I was there” but he said he doesn’t know where the bar is which would imply he’s never been? / []
He's not the major villain here. He's merely an entitled pervert. His mother is the real evil, she facilitated his escape from justice. / []
Jeez this man is insane 😂 / []
He's stuttering 😂😂😂 / []
The focus on Meghan Markle and NOT this man, is sheer proof of the side the mainstream media is on and a core reason they want RID of the BBC! / []
Liar!!! / []
People on hard drugs Can i  helped  Crazy❤😂🎉 / []
Swindon ❤🎉 / []
Your tie need fix in Bless❤😂🎉 / []
I dreamt  It was too late  I was bushes hog in the garden  But I saw ablack bag in Conner  I pick it up Bit heavy so I tossed Over the fence A black snake fell out if the bag Smallish  I find this dream funny 😁 😮😢  sovereign  The bag was a scandal bag like what we take grocery shopping in Jamaica 😅 ❤🎉 / []
Beastly / []
He paid her off.   Proof he is guilty!!!   This interview was a bloody train wreck from the moment he sat down.   He should be in jail.   He remembers the pizza with his daughters,  but can't remember if he met Virginia upstairs..................must be his memory has gone the way of his sweat glands.   No one is buying any of this B.S. / []
My goodness the actor playing andrew is spot on looking like him cudos to whomever did the casting / []
I had heard that this interview was something like a dumpster fire cross-bred with a train wreck, but, on finally seeing it for myself, I can say it is far worse. / []
It maybe 😏 offended  Not to sleep 💤😴 on your pillow  It shape your face younger generation  The Chinese quite cleverly mostly Ty ❤😂🎉 / []
Tie need fixin loosen a bit in order ❤😂🎉 / []
❤🎉🎉❤ / []
I can not believe the comments haven’t been disabled. Jesus.  Meanwhile Prince Andrew is still rich af. / ['You defending him?? 😂😂😂😂']
Full of shit / []
Clearly there is video footage filmed within Epstein’s homes of Prince Andrew sweating, he’s clearly a liar then!! / []
Maitlis is excellent. My favourite of her intimations is the 'She dined with you..."  - - -  leaving the almost automatic next thought for the audience so obvious I don't need to say it.  But the closing is the best...She FINALLY lets him off the hook "We're going to have to wrap things up..."   followed by PA's EXORBITANT laugh of absolute relief... BUT SHE'S NOT FINISHED...  At this point, when Andrew is panicking,  literally burbling nonsense, Maitliss should have done Yondu Visits The Broker Scene from GOTG. / []
Have you ever had a massage     Never in my life from anyone    bursts a  blood vessel   in his brain  shaking  head. no no no no      what a mother effer / []
He's  as dumb as little whining Harry / []
Oh my God / []
I don't  read or hear about what  is going on in the united States and nobody ever mentioned it to me    i hace quite  a busy  shedule  you must understand             so ful of shite       hisxarmpits were ije a water faucet / []
He was single so  party a lot He really thought that interview will help him ,and that he is smart😅 / []
I find this intresting hat also many other high profilers were also friends with Jeffrey / []
More PR, always be a victim to gain the sympathy of the ignorant public, loop, "I SUFFER from an inability to sweat which I just recently gained back again (Whew! Just in time and post Epsteins suicide and sex trafficking investigation, heat 😰) due to being shot at while serving to protect the innocent citizens of my sacred country". And poor Beatrice must now go down in history as her Pop's feeble alibi to sex trafficking a minor Russian female who we can only pray has found her worth🙏 WTH? An enslaved stalker, must visit his obsession to beg for release and absolve him of his guilt in sex trafficking collusion...My God save the queen. / []
He sounds so dishonest / []
Aren`t we gonna talk about Emily devouring the interview. / []
he stutters all the recording so we can assume he lies  from the peak upto the bottom... / []
British people look like angels. Imagine this guy going nuts at Epstiens parties / []
Such a lying man / []
As girls are photographed coming out of JE house, he is there to tell him they can’t be friends.  Such a liar. He thinks he was convincing. He is disgusting.  His daughters should disown him. He should go to jail. / []
How many times was his name on that list.  Jeffrey was not his close friend?  Pathetic / []
Why is he not in jail? / []
Nothing done about this, and nothing ever will be because they are all in it together. / []
The Scoop reenactment of this is perfect!! / []
Awwwe man that’s hard to watch. His life’s work gone in 30 minutes. Silly silly silly man. / ["What do you mean life's work? You're immediately successful when you form part of the royal family."]
Duke of BS / []
His Royal Dryness / []
Reptiles dont sweat / []
He is a good Liar / []
Guilty as sin / []
"That's definitely me, but that's not a picture of me in London" 🤣😭. Wtf / []
He has convinced me, totally innocent / []
The whole york family are absolutely corrupt and disgusting right!!!! / ["Yeah, we shouldn't have any monarchy in this century"]
*Emily:* _They said they saw you get a massage from a Russian missus..._ *What I thought Andrew would say:*  _No...She wasn't Russian. She was Romanian._ / []
Hahahahahahah / []
What a prince ! Broke it off because it was inappropriate not because it is horrific / []
Sweaty old ball sack / []
You would think the palace would have been informed of the rumours before Epstein’s conviction and the potential for blackmail of the Prince and steered him away from the man. / []
You are no longer a prince / []
Full of shit / []
WHICH IS PERFECTLY SUITED TO THE VARIOUS CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO BRITAIN ATTEMPTING TO RETAIN TORTURE CONTRACTS WITH WASHINGTON DC AFTER THE UK WAS LEGALLY DISBANDED BY BREXIT, ISNT IT? / []
AND IT HAS GONE FAR BEYOND THE POINT OF KEEPING YOUR SEX TRAFFICKING A SECRET, OR A CONFIDENTIAL. COURT CASE, HASNT IT?!  BECAUSE YOURE ALL STILL HOLDING ME HOSTAGE AND FORCING ME TO USE TPG INTERNET WHO ARE SELLING THE MATERIAL TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BLACK MAIL YOU / []
He answers the questions of the interviewer juist like my cheating ex was answering my questions: ''Well, if you put it this way, yeah, buuuut ... this is what actually happend''...yeah, right... / []
Somewere in education they did big mistake!!! / []
O why turnd of😢 / []
As Vladimir Putins childhood wife i am sick and tired of playing the Jeffery eupstines orgies Island war games games with the Bush's Clintons Obamas and Bidens and then Howell Heflin and Doug Jones and Jeff sessions offices of faked switched documents of the marlogo documents that Donald Trump found and was investigating for Vladimir Putin about what happened to his childhood wife and twins sons for king Salman that the bush's Clintons had kidnapped out of Washington DC from Richard Nixions offices to the florence ala areas to a child molester that was not arrested that everyone knew that was his friends / []
No kids on earth wants to play the Jeffery eupstines orgies Island war games with the Bush's Clintons Obamas and Bidens or Howell Heflin and Doug Jones and Jeff sessions offices of new faked identitys to a child molesters friend / []
Ask any kids in the United States of America and around the world Do you want to play a child molesters war games with the Bush's Clintons Obamas and Bidens as Vladimir Putins childhood wife that has not seen her childhood husband in about 55 years along with her real brother king Salman that is the only brother living that she can meet after playing a sex trafficking sex offenders war games that no kids need or wants to play that could wind up sex trafficked and kidnapped to places like Jeffery eupstine orgies Island / []
Andy always played the stupid idot lol lol that said alot but never really said nothing when they got through / []
Funny thing was Andy did not want to share his tricycle with me before I left Windsor before king Faisal and I left for Washington DC to play this strange child molester sex trafficking war games with the Bush's and Clintons for the last 55 years that I have a new set of fake identities that Donald Trump found and was investigating for Vladimir Putin about what happened to his childhood wife and twins sons over the last 55 years that I really don't like and can not stand like some thing off of Craigslist as a child molesters paradise for orgies on orgies Island that I really did not want to play for the last 55 years since I been kidnapped and abducted and missing from Saudi Arabia and Russia as mylie Abdullah adziz / []
The funny thing was that I have not found funny i that I been missing for about 55 years as king Faisals baby sister as mylie Abdullah adziz  king Abdullah adziz daughter that lives near florence ala from Richard Nixions offices from Washington DC that the crazy Bush's Clintons that wanted to play some sortof crazy sex trafficking cannibals Island war games from Craigslist / []
The stupid thing was we all knew everyone when we was young the Elizabeth and that my brother king Faisal and Charlie already knew everybody when we was kids that always came through the back door of Buckingham Palace just like Charlie's friend civile / []
Andy just needs to go ride his tricycle while me and king Faisal talk with Elizabeth / []
Funny thing was is that the trees have eyes just like every tall building that can not be searched that saw what happened on orgies Island  that was hidden before everyone arrived on Jeffery eupstines orgies Island that someone knows what who did what on orgies Island with other peoples kids as a hate groups that did sex trafficking hate crimes against someone's else's kids / []
The picture is real its been proven / []
Hey everybody just FYI the picture has been proven to be legitimate the person who took the photo demonstrate just look it up / []
Andrew is a coward, a common coward.  Just like tne rest of the royal family. A bunch of uneleected, over privileged, self entitled cowards. They do nothing for this country The sooner they crawl back under the etones from whence they came the better. / []
Disgusting royal privilege - the monarchy needs to be dismantled - useless leaches to the taxpayers of Great Britain! / []
Like a bull who brings his own china shop / []
This is absolutely insane! / []
His reaction to John Brockman's name is priceless. / []
I bet his judgement was colored by tendency of liking young girls. One sick mf / []
Sometimes I don't know if he is lying or if he is just an idiot. / []
Just a reminder - Epstein did not kill himself. / []
Enter president shit Tennessee into 🎉 / []
How does he know a photo was shot "upstairs" if he "never went upstairs" in that house?? He knows what rooms like that he's never seen? / []
Cap 😂 / []
still nothing happend to him since and the victims of  this monstrosity epstein is dead too .... / []
30:17 How TF is that difficult to answer??If someone accused me of assaulting minors and I did not do it then that is a VERY easy thing to answer! / []
When he says he met up with Epstein to end things and he met face to face so as not to be a chicken.....no. He knew Epstein had dirt on him b/c Epstein was many things but he was not stupid...i absolutely believe he took that photo of Andrew and Virginia and he took it as collateral. / []
16:28 🎯 / []
11:24 ....I think here is where he realized this reporter was not on the family's payroll and he f*#@$! up 😂 / []
When this woman says "Just for the record" ....shes about to bring the smackdown 😭😂 / []
"Pass me a shovel I'm about to dig my own grave". Prince (so called) Andrew / ['He was given a JCB not a shovel !!! 😅']
The fact that the guy thought he did great is just- / []
Gotta admit, Andrew could get a job in the mining industry with how efficiently he managed to dig a hole that deep for himself in 49 minutes and 26 seconds / ['😂😂😅', 'Well he’s in the minor industry currently so he’s halfway there.', '@JF9. Damn, straight for the throat 😆😆', '😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👌👌👌', 'fast and consequently!']
It seems that Diddy is starting to be seen in the same light like Epstein which could be troubling for Prince William and Prince Harry since Both have been photographed interacting with Diddy also it means that tabloids definitely have been unfair to Prince Andrew because of His Association to Jeffrey Epstein!!! / []
Why UK still has a monarchy in the 21st century ？ so bizarre. / ['Very bizarre...but hey as long as the public in the UK continues to worship them they will stick around lol', 'Cause we want a monarchy', "Some of us don't want one,\nIt is like a very polite dictatorship lol"]
Man needs to rot in hell. Why hasn't he yet? / []
Don't tell me in navy he had to work hard / []
I dont know why British people love royal family / ['The weird worship of royals has always been very very strange to me....', "Because they've done lot of country are you stpid 😂 . You forgot how a small country ruled half of the continent 😂"]
An overdose of adrenaline? 😂😂 wouldn’t having a significant amount of adrenaline make you sweat more?? 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ / ['Adrenochrome']
Cheap.  Vulgar prince ... Only prostitutes were interested in him / []
Boom! The biggest self destruct in TV history and he thought it went well. Shows you how arrogant and out of touch he is. Must have been quite the crushing revelation in the days afterwards. / ['"Without putting to fine a point on it"...Andrew $#$% Up', 'Would have been good to have been a fly on the wall']
if you're poor or middle class, a picture of you with your accuser in the house of a human trafficker would have been enough evidence for arrest and charges. how is the british royal family still a thing / []
Emily should interview harry & markles. / []
Fair play that he actually gave an interview. / []
A good man. / []
Hes such a bad lier here because, he only relized the wrongness of his actions when they were nolonger permitted and when they began to be scrutinized.  You see... like Epstein, Andrew was allowed to diddle minors. And like Epstein, Andrew doesn't  have a moral compass of his own. For Andrew whatever he can get away with/whatever's allowed, isnt wrong. Hes half a person...  Andrew isnt sinister, hes just a fool. .....pitiful 😷 / []
I would not be able to contain myself if I was Emily. This guy literally buried himself deeper and deeper with every question and she just stayed so calm witnessing him going under. She is a savage. This much control. Utterly brilliant interview. Emily was magnificent / ['She really was. Much respect to her', "I don't know how she kept a straight face..", '@sharonmortimer4177She probably was disgusted inside. I know I would be.', 'I completely agree She needs to interview MM', 'I thought she was going too easy on him. For instance, it\'s been widely reported that Epstein\'s "den" in New York was full of sexually explicit paintings and pieces of art (as well as "toys" everywhere). As Andrew had visited on so many occasions and with all the people coming and going (including young women) how was it even possible for him to no see that something was up with Epstein? For Andy to just highlight business and networking opportunities is not good enough.']
Anyone else wonder why this generation of royalty seem to have a coincidental link to pedophiles? / []
He is a sick horrible person. / []
She is so darn good !     He is so darn stupid ! / []
His tie is crooked / []
“I didn’t sweat at the time” / []
Fact is this guy is been in the island an on different properties many many times.Plenty evidence. Ppl been paid so they kept quiet.  Still nothing is been done years later. definitely  nothing will happen in uk Will have to be in USA. But improbable. their American cousins probably will cover for them so nothing goes to court So staff fizzled out an eventually just a funny joke / []
“What I- he HE was doing”. my jaw dropped / ['You caught that too!😂😂😂']
“Because he’d been convicted, it’s not appropriate we be seen together”.  So not because he did horrible things, but because he got caught lol / ['And not appropriate they spend time together, just not be seen.']
Nathan Macintosh brought me here…and not even 15 minutes in and I have laughed out loud 5 times at some of this guy’s answers…like SIR. / []
“Unbecoming? He was a sex offender”   Legendary.   Interesting his choice of words when describing his walk in the park with Epstein and how he wanted to end the friendship because it was “inappropriate to be seen together”, not that it was inappropriate for him to be friends with a sex offender. He told on himself right there and then. / []
#Mitigate verb  make (something bad) less severe, serious, or painful. / []
YOURE FUCKED RAMEZ, BEN AND BRENDAN / []
The truth of it is that the media wanted to tear him down. That's why no-one likes them. They specialise in destroying people's reputations. / ['Most of UK media is on the payroll for these ppl 😂', "@brenda9410 Oh, that's what you think."]
Epstien didn't kill himself / ['Obviously they had him killed']
Jj / []
Moron, he contradicts himself constantly.  He knew Epstein was arrested for raping a minor. There is no justification for EVER being in his presence again or associating in any way with Epstein. What a lying piece of sh!!  Does he really think anyone believes him? / []
I’d love to know the results of a polygraph test / []
PAY YOUR BILLS I WANT TO SEE MY DOGS! / []
Meeting the child. Ohh sounds like a familiar pattern from that incest fueled family, and the ones causing chaos and destruction throughout the world. Vile vile behaviour from pigs / []
Definitely not eehhh definitely not yes definitely without a doubt / []
Guilty as sin he is making a fool of himself / []
Surely doing this interview is without a doubt the worst idea anyone has ever had, EVER. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Ok but what if he is NOT lying? Why is it so certain that he is? / ['Pfft…lol…', '@gruphenio6787 Gnznrx...pflkt...']
When i first heard of SCOOP I thought it was about ice cream. / []
I like the parts where he talks about "thick skin" and not being able to sweat. / ["He's too honourable to sweat, how dare you!!"]
The people in UK  have given a pass to this family for way too long. / ['So true.']
Virginia was 17 for Christ sake: it was consensual sex; it was not like she was an innocent little girl who did not know what the name of the game was, so to speak. / []
She says you bought her a drink  Well that’s impossible because I don’t have any money 😂😂😂 Imagine what the other brother can say / []
'Not very good friends with Epstein'...trying to weasel his way out of that, does he think non-royals are moronic like him? The depth of stupidity on his part goes beyond the pale, and wish the women abused by him, Epstein, Ghislaine and others all the best! / []
I love the fact Emily wore trousers and a jacket with military overtones. She was dressed for battle, and when I saw the Netflix's Scoop  I believed it was cinematic artifice. To see she really did  dress for battle is fabulous. / []
Surprised the BBC didn’t hire him / []
?xx. / []
Historic interview.  Down with the  useless / []
Scoop / []
The more I watch this interview the more I understand that his soul was looking for redemption without him actually knowing... / []
27:21 Oh Andrew, the LAST bloody thing you want is the original photograph ever surfacing. If it did, you and your fellow cohort Lady Victoria Hervey  would very much be an even bigger "loss to explain'.  I loathe calling Victoria Hervey a" lady", as she's anthing but a lady. I'd rather think of her as spit out gum on dirty street I've stepped on and I'm stuck with.   Here is a clip I made of the ever so delightful Lady Hervey on Piers Morgan saying what an honorable person Andrew is:  https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx0IgvUbRbRT1rJBy-K1UJ1CKzGmaFO_sT?si=dBrHC-_issKNN2jH / []
This is still hilarious years later 😂 / []
I dont think I ever bought a drink whenever I was there.   He just finished saying he didn't know where tramps was.   What a f#$king idiot. / []
"It is very difficult... to try and forget... positive action".....but not impossible / []
Sometimes I come back to this interview to remind myself of what a train-wreck in real time ( well lol) looks like. This interviewer was phenomenal. So gentle with her questioning and still lethal lol / ['He was much less than a worthy opponent']
IMPO, Andrew and Epstein  needed 3-4 days to align their stories (collude)so if there was a court case, they would make sure their stories were the same.  Since they spent quiet a bit of time together, they had a lot to go over to make sure they wouldn't contradict  each other if they were questioned by authorities.  Andrew could have called or facetimed him to tell him he wasn't meeting him anymore, but then it might have been recorded.  I think it's a damming interview, and the Netflix series gives Andrew the point of no return.   Neither do I think Virginia "Roberts" (now) would trump up charges against the prince unless their was proof.     His verbiage is telling "I don't recall,  I'm convinced it never happened, I don't think it could have happened at all, I was home with the children, that's a very difficult thing to answer, I don't remember meeting her at all, I don't remember a photograph being took, I don't remember anything, I've been wracking my brain, I've been through it, and through it and through it, over and over and over again, and nothing"....His paying out 12 million pounds so the case didn't go to court is also telling. / []
"The truth of it" / []
Simply a very stupid boy / []
I think that interview went pretty well! Don't you agree mommy 😂 / []
Is Sad how people in power are all weird and do so many illegal things, mainly trafficking under age kids and get away with it and we all know is true but yet they all free. / []
Two nasty, awful people talking. I'd like both of them to exit this planet, and I am not a bad person, but I think that as a whole we would be far better off without individuals like this. / []
Dottoressa Emily lei è bellissima e affascinante. / []
Well done Sam McAlister and Jae Donnelly! I hope this type of educated and experienced reporting never stops as it’s obviously vital to humanity. / []
Staavy’s world podcast brought me here / ['Same this better be good']
For some reason, I'm allergic to bullshit. / []
He recognises gillhain's upstairs in the photo, but he never went up there. / []
how are the comments 3 weeks and 3 years ago if this thing is live? / []
Surely the best thing is to say you know it didn’t happen because you never slept with underage girls 🙈 / []
We can all tell he's a total dick / []
If it was 12th century, he had to fight in the war with sword 😂 / []
My tendency to be too honourable 😅😅😅😅😅 that’s a good one This being said how on earth could underaged girls stick around if it wasn’t willingly? Nobody forced them to stay This interview really doesn’t deserve the praise the world has given to it. If the girls had been 18 then it would have been a non starter……just one year gap crazy. / []
This is so wild lol / []
Isn't it obvious that the prince has a doppelganger, or at least a lookalike? It's the only explanation. / []
Stavvy’s world sent me / []
Funny that……. 1.30 … “it was a considerable stretch to say we were close friends!! 11.11…….I took the decision, I had to show leadership I had to go and see him and I had to tell him thats it .”  36.00…..I’m like everybody else!!” What a sham, whole interview was a contradiction. / []
Are we REALLY to believe that this Royal pratt would be allowed by his own security to be passed by numbers of strange people in Epstiens house? No risk of attack?.... No secure measures in place?....  Emily also failed to ask an obvious question: did you receive foot massages and other massages yes or no? / []
The grand old Duke of York,  He paid twelve million quid, To someone that he never met And something he never did!!!! / ['Made me crack up lmao', '🤣👍🏻', '😂😂😂', '@lyndahodge7552\xa0 did He also have 10,000 men?', "Nope that was beloved mommy using the subjects taxpayer's money  as she pleased."]
so people from west still dont see problem in elit that rule there? / []
so princ needed house wile he is in USA to sleep?strange,someone would think they have one there or pay hotel 😅 / []
If the police had asked Andrew these questions and they'd heard these  ridiculous answers he'd be in jail now. / []
Hands up if the latest Stavvy’s World podcast sent you here / []
17:55! You're welcome! / []
Congratulations! / []
I've actually watched this interview a couple😁 times and his absurdity and lies hits me right between the eyes 😵every time🤣 he is an absolute clown. However I do feel very bad for his daughters princess Eugenie and Beatrice. It would be so humiliating if this happened with your father and then to have him go on national TV and make himself look so utterly ridiculous that anybody from The real world can see he's a complete liar....(and creep)What a embarrassment 😳 / []
I just watched scoop on netflix so watched this back,omg he's a terrible liar,hard to watch / []
If you say “categorically” your argument will seem more convincing. / []
“Here’s the problem: I’ve never seen Epstein with a camera in my life” / []
“There are number of things that are wrong with that story”🤥 / []
“It was a convenient place to stay”😂😂😂 / []
Same person talking about honorable things to do simultaneously staying 4 days in convicted sex offender's property😮 / []
These celebrities lie right to your face. It's sickening. / []
40:35 if that isn’t a laugh of relief idk what is / []
Why he is not in prison? Oh yes he pay.. Tax payer money? I can't get my head around how easy he got away with this. And majority of the public keep silent about it. / ['The public majority are sheep. They get news, say it’s bad and move on to their jobs. No justice. Would rather cry about misogyny in comic books than hold people accountable']
all this moron had to do to get away with it was refuse to give an interview. I think it's time for England for a new royal line / []
Uum um um um um…too many ums! He certainly went for the wrong thing and has his picture taken with her. LORD, he seems rather simple and I’m a nobody.  Geez really Andrew? / []
Like so what ?? I was expecting some smoking gun or something.  It's everyone judging his character because everyone wants to make a privileged man who's a prince and then ask stupid questions of why he was hanging around groups of elite because they are wealthy.  Like people are losing it / ['Did you even watch this? Are you that stupid? He literally admitted to being around him AFTER the convictions. There are pictures of him touching underage girls. He’s been to the Island.']
That laugh he does, when she says Epstein is dead. That’s so creepy / []
'It was a convenient place to stay   My tendency to be too honourable  . What a pig headed buffoon / []
Anyone else pick up that he said of Epstein and the palace "We all knew him"? / []
Prince Andrew deflecting perfectly. He cannot recollect and basically everyone else is lying, his part was innocent and best of all, he can't remember!  This absolutely is like  my conversation with my husband when he was caught red handedly cheating! My husband is not a prince... but he's a liar, cheater and I know he likes young girls as well!! Same tactics, same lies and same deflections. - A liar is a liar no matter who they are! / []
"I dont remember ever going upstairs,  because that photo is taken upstairs"    Omg / []
It's incredible that Prince Andrew paid £14m to someone he has never met before / []
See that photograph was taken upstairs. I've never been upstairs!😂 / []
Comentário em português que vocês estavam esperando, quem mais está aqui pela Netflix? E quanta incoerência nessas falas né ? / []
Andy: bros before hoes, amirite? / []
Everytime is having a rough time I come back to watch this interview what a car crash he sound like a kid trying to remember his story after been caught by his mum for not camping at his friends  house lol / []
Why is this video so hard to find when I search for it? It should be the first result when searching for Prince Andrew Interview. / ['Yt trying to hide anything epstein related. The 8 minute video of him talking is hard to find too']
Thank you BBC and thank you Netflix this is impeccable and also great to see the lies pouring out his mouth. / []
The interesting thing about this interview is that he really thought people were buying what he was selling, and I am talking about Prince Andrew. The more I see of this man, the more I question the judgment of Queen Elizabeth because it was widely known that he  was her favorite child. / []
he is failed in this interview, oh my Allah , he is the prince of ook / []
Sure he was squirming and being evasive but i don't think it was was a total CF, he came out of it with his dignity intact. / ['He lost whatever dignity he had a long time ago. Probably around the time he started grooming kids.']
I have no recollection of watching this interview / []
Best confession I have ever seen! / []
Just watched movie Scoop. Its very good! Its interesting watching this interview after the movie. He is very full of his own self importance and completely out of touch with reality. / []
I hate this because I grew up loving Prince Andrew….what a disgrace. Excuse after excuse. / []
Shhheduale lol / []
Her:It has been said that you visited 4 times a year  Him:not at all only 4 times in total 🤔🤔🤔 / []
FSOB / []
"Uphold highest standards of the royal family" - Friend of a convicted paedophile/ adulterer/ briefs negative press against family members for their own interest/ neglects those suffering with mental health/ fails to speak out against abuse against the first person of colour in the royal family" - Very high standards indeed - I have complete respect for them / []
Still living on taxpayers funding! However does not get a fraction of the coverage Harry and Meghan do. The royal family protects who they want to, even a close friend of a convicted paedophile! / []
Nobody pays 12M hush money if they're innocent.  He's bent as a dog's hind leg.  Why fly to say goodbye to someone you've not particularly close to.  Lies 😅 / []
We all seen the inside Epstein’s Palm Springs home… And Andy saw nothing out of the ordinary!  … 😂😂😂😂 / []
It was an open secret among his social set, you big lying baboon / []
“Well I stayed at his house because he was such a difficult man to get a hold of,” says a Prince of England. This man has been told his whole life that he could charm the skin off a snake and he thinks he is very effectively doing this now. Massive cringe. / ["That's the thing. Been babied and pampered."]
12 mil😮.. there's more to this... my opinion! / []
This is my 4th time watching....never gets old😂 / []
He's quite dumb 😂😭 / []
Guilty guilty guilty had to go and tell him and be a leader email or phone call even a text then you go to his coming home party hahahahha mate he dropped himself rite in it / []
It is really interesting to see him nodding at 27:44, while he's saying it never happened. / []
But the way he keeps saying things to deny them is funny indeed. / []
As someone not familiar with the way he speaks and seeing him on a daily/knowing how he speaks, this comes off to me very innocent (the way that he speaks I mean). Like very light and easy. Came here from Scoop and didn’t feel that way from the reanactment so a little surprised here. / []
Gara gara alur cerita film kesini / []
I still can't believe this shit is real / []
5:44 "At the time, I was patron of the Full Stop campaign, so I knew what to look for regarding abuse of children." 34:40 "First of all, I'm not looking for it." / []
I bet these english princes wish they could convert to islam so they could just have a harem full of kids out in the open / []
The dude paid 12mil pounds to that girl. Why? He said he didnt do anything with her. / ["Hey, pizza express isn't cheap!", '@Evergreen0021 😅🤣😂']
... Well i would like To know   who Else looks like Prince Andrew? I never Did / []

Burn in hell / []
"Never felt the need to go partying" says the prince who back in the day was known in the British press as 'Randy Andy' The man is an absolute joke. / []
I’m here because of Marsupials! Stop shagging Marsupials!!!! / []
Where are Marsupials? She didn’t bring the Marsupials!!! / []
Still a pure w….r / []
This was a terrific interview and "The Scoop" is spot on in the recreation. I wonder why the British public pay 'maintenance' to the upkeep of these ludicrous members. / []
Sometimes l have no memory of having a memory”, EXCEPT when l went to pizza express in woking on the 10th of march.  So he should be diagnosed for selective amnesia. / []
'I never have *really* partied' HAHAHAHA, OMG he must think we are idiots; the 80's newspapers were filled with pictures of him partying. There is one pic where is naked with some gals around. / []
Nodding, nodding then "I have no recollection of meeting this lady" Yeah, sure. / []
all I can simply say is if a prince wants nothing do with anyone….! He doesn’t take the liberal approach! He sends his team to inform those! / []
Too bad!, / []
Shame on you Dirty Andrew Shame Shame Shame 🤬🤬🤬🤬 / []
The late queen really had an interesting lot of kids. / []
Honorable .....really? / []
scoop brought me here again, actually saw this back in 19 / []
Pathetic demeanor during this interview . / []
Whoever let him do this interview hated him. This is the stupidest thing he could’ve done. Did anyone prep him for this?? / ['He actually overuled all advice for him to not do it! 😂', 'His own dumb ass agreed to this suicide😂🎉']
Watching this again after seeing the Netflix's x film Scoop. What an idiot he is! I know he is King Charles brother, but really, this man, that s obvious liar, should not be allowed to be seen at functions with the royal family. What a disgrace he is. I have a feeling that once Prince William becomes King, he will push Andrew to the back of the bus where he belongs. / []
What a tool!  " If you're a man, sex is a positive action. So I didn't have sex with a trafficked under age girl".  " Strange and unpleasant activities". Don't you mean raping underage girls??  This reporter is excellent not reacting to his arrogance and stupidity. / []
His wife Sarah Ferguson was caught in a Sting taking cash for access. She also embarrassed herself having an affair with photo's of her being slutty. And his daughters are unappealing and weird. What a pile of burdensome crappie this lot are. / []
If he had as much brains as he has pomposity.... / []
Wait… Just listen to him talk without watching this interview on a screen. He is cold and completely ambivalent that he was friends with a pedophile. / []
He is like British Donald Trump XD / []
I gave it one but was not there. / []
Theyre all Draconian, reptiles. / []
I don’t think we should be seen together…takes a stroll thru NYC. / []
20:12 “Pizza express in working”🍕 21:27 “sweating allegations”💧 / []
Alguém legenda esse vídeo esse português 🙏🏽 / []
Him and Trump would get along. / []
27:00 he dropped himself in it, admitting he was in the house… / []
I've wracked my brain to make sure I don't remember having sex with the teenage girl 🤔 / []
After all Epstein did, Andrew still thought he gained a lot of knowledge from being friends with him 😮. / []
A pathetic LIAR / []
'Scoop' people, the meetings is happening here. / []
He was friends with Epstein's girlfriend but he flew to NY to tell him he cant be friends with him anymore..he knew exactly where the photo was taken but he cant recall ever meeting the girl..he didnt sweat at the time...and then there's the whole thing of he didn't see anything but that Epstein's house was like a station...people coming in and out all the time. / []
I feel so sorry for King Charles because he has to deal with this pervert. / []
I did not enjoy this  episode simply because Randy Andy is an absolute pervert.  What a creep! / []
He should be in prison. / []
Priceless 😂 / []
Has anyone counted the amount of times he says ummm / []
The way I thought the actor portraying Andrew in Scoop was overacting. He was spot on, its the actual former prince andrew who was overacting😂 / []
Who was advising this guy?  🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 Liar liar pants on fire. / []
Prince Andie, a mischievous lad with chocolate smeared across his face, stands before his mummy, Queen Eliza. "Andie, darling boy, do you happen to know who has devoured all of my chocolates?" the queen asked, her voice tinged with suspicion. With a nervous yet confident smirk, Andie replied, "Oh, mummy, I haven't the foggiest notion. It must have been one of the footmen. Perhaps it's time to dismiss them for pilfering our treats." As he spoke, chocolate wrappers spilled from his pockets, and his hands bore the telltale signs of indulgence. Queen Eliza chuckled and affectionately pinched his nose. "Oh, Andie, my dearest darling boy, you always manage to spin a tale. Such a clever rascal you are," she said, pride evident in her voice. Andie beamed with satisfaction, oblivious to his transparent deception, relishing in the belief of his own cunning. Queen Eliza's laughter lingered in the air as she left Andie to his naive schemes. / []
This stupid feminist journalist twist things in order to frame prince andrew as a paedophile / []
"I could have gone and stayed somewhere else, but the sheer convenience" of staying with a man who abuses underage girls... / []
5:13 "We _now_ know that. At the time, there was no indication, to me or anybody else, that that was what he was...doing." 5:44 "At the time, I was patron of the Full Stop campaign, so I knew what to look for regarding abuse of children. But I never saw anything." 6:15 "Just for record, you've been on his private plane?" "Yes." Andrew rode on the plane called "Lolita Express". The "little girl express". And never picked up on anything suspicious.... 🤦 / []
Horse shit / []
Why such a strong reaction to the John Brockman question I wonder… / []
He sounds like a 7 year old / []
All lies. Period. / []
😂me / []
Did you notice hundreds of underaged girls in his house? WTF  how could you miss that and how big was this house? / []
Really? 🤔 A convicted sex offender and trafficker deserves an honourable in person visit from the Prince of England to break up a "friendship" 🤦🏼‍♀️😂 jaysus!!!! / []
Ive only been to Woking once and that was enough. Randy Andy claims to have been there a couple of times.  All i can say is he wasn't there when i went.  😂😂😂 / []
What is this? / []
Does he stutter or he is just nervous here? / []
Liar Liar and Liar / []
Emily's attire telegraphed to Andrew her personal belief about him, and what was to come. Never seen her body as tightly wrapped as this for an interview. And if she hadn't? Btw, I like Prince Andrew, & Emily / ['You like pedos sick mf']
I wonder if he really said " Why are they so concerned with my relationship with Epstien, I knew Jimmy Saville much better". / []
Andrew's advisor says it best..."if you want a future tell the people." He sure did / []
everything is a bit of a stretch according to PA, maybe he needs to do a stretch in pr1son!!! The party prince is hilarious, theres a spoof somewhere that shows him partying in photographic stills while saying Im not a partying type!!! marvellous interview, Loved Scoop too!! / []
Just own up posh boy you smashed the granny out of it😂 Seriously you're too old for that punani😢 / []
What a w@#€×&,seriously. Again a rich powerful man getting away with a sexual offence. Disgusting / []
is obvious that he has never had to deal with any kind of scrutiny...he is absolutely dreadful at this....reminds me of a kid being asked if they had stolen the chocolate biscuits and them denying it with chocolate all around their mouth....pathetic liar / []
Andrew speaks like he’s a diety taking very important time off from his duties to descend from the Mountain and converse with the mortals. He’s honestly thinking he teaching us something valuable about how difficult life up there is. But that’s royalty for you. In the Netherlands we’re slightly better off but not by much…. / []
He was friends with Epstein because he was buying what Epstein was selling. / []
The royal family killed Epstein in jail .. the list of the elites that are pedophiles will never be recovered / []
Lying and getting away with it takes a lot more intelligence than this dimwit has. / []
Liar Liar Pants on Fire / []
Too much adrenaline makes you sweat more. It doesn’t make you unable to sweat. / []
Emily is dressed in a quiet buttoned-down, non-threatening outfit. Perfect. / []
He says his friendship was really with Ghislaine Maxwell - that’s as bad. She was convicted on five charges for recruiting and grooming four underage girls for Epstein!! / []
I just want to straighten his tie😂😂 / ['Me too!']
game over for andrew / []
scoop got me here and no turning back / []
It is astounding how much he thinks he is actually saying things that people will believe. / []
"Polite and honourable. " I've seen a stupid, liar and arrogant individual. / []
"bring a group of people together" - yeah thats the whole accusation buddy / []
He’s so full of sh*t / []
wow🙄 / []
straightforward shooting weekend...  totally out of touch with real life / []
also to be clear, there are no good guys in this interview. The BBC are absolute scum who covered up Jimmy Savile's crimes. You;re watching a criminal enterprise interview another. / []
You’ve got to be prepped for this kind of interview like your life depended on it. / []
Perhaps we’ll pass you shovel ? Dig your hole a bit deeper? / []
Scoop brought me here / []
"The picture cannot be possible because it's upstairs,  and I don't remember being upstairs" what an absurde argument!! / ["How does it know it was a photo from upstairs if he'd never been upstairs.  Plus he's going to go to these houses repeatedly and not ever go upstairs even for a tour?", 'Well, the last part of the answer is actually very tricky. \nLawers always recommend using the phrase "I don\'t rememember/recall". Cause if somebody can that prove you actually did that smth, it will mean you were lying. And if you say I don\'t remember that simply means you don\'t remember and you can\'t be accused of lying.', 'He probably was upstears. He thinks he can deny being there, but in order to be caucious he prefers the "safe" phrase. 😂', "And he wasn't in a suit and tie, so def not in London.", '@brendakauffman2222 He was just hanging around downstairs watching telly - and didn’t know what was going on upstairs….']
Terrible idea by Andrew to participate in this interview. Having said that, I don't see any proof here that he committed any crimes. He may have been foolish, naeieve, but important to remember thats very different to Epstein's crimes. / []
"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady" ... he says,  but later he agreed to pay a big amount of money to her,  so the legal cause would end / ['It was his Mommy who paid to cover up what this privileged prick did']
I liked the movie,  but I think they show prince Andrew kind of stupid,  and I  think in the actual interview he does not seem so. / []
Says he seen him 1-2/3 times a year. Then later in the interview says he seen him 3-4 times a year for the duration of the time he knew him. / []
dig dig and dig again and again / []
Just blows the mind that some  people of wealth engage in these  types of environments doing whatever they feel like.  No worries about consequences, as they mostly don’t exist for them & they know it well. / []
I'm probably smarter than most of these billionaires😂 / []
I guess I'm late on this, but he is scum. / []
I've just gotten to the part in Scoop when the interview starts, and had to come and see if Andrew really was as thick and embarrassing as the actor portrayed.  Wow, he was even worse. He is so full of shit, and it's so obvious. / []
That photograph was taken upstairs.  I know it's upstairs because I've never been there and I've never had a photograph taken.  I've never had a photograph taken of me upstairs because I've never been upstairs to have my photograph taken. / ['Thats what stood out for me, if you had never been upstairs you would never know what it looked like 🤣🤣']
The absolute  pleasure I get from watching the complete down  fall  of this  very pompous, dimwitted, spoiled bore of a man and he only has  himself to blame for this 💩 the more he talks the deeper he digs his own grave 😂😂😂😂  🤦🤷🙄 he should be flogged marched back to America and stand trial... bloated bore of a man .who would go for a walk with a convicted child sex abuser if your a Prince and your mother is the Queen of United Kingdom 🤔.. he's a two-faced liar. / []
This interview is better than scoop / []
Scoop is a pretty bad movie made around an amazing interview. Men that are good in war are pretty bad in normal life after. / []
You die if you don't sweat. An overdose of adrenaline causes short term hear problems,  nothing long term affecting your ability to sweat. / []
It always amazed me that the public (and the royal family) seemed to focus more on Meghan than Andrew during all this. / ['Because she is an inelegant c***. At least Andrew has class.', 'Meghan is as bad as Andrew.', '@tropicalpalmtreewtf? How?', '\u200b@tropicalpalmtreeabsolutely ridiculous statement']
Jeff and i were not close. But i needed to tell him in person that we needed to break up! / []
wow i,ve watched this interview when it was happening. After, i've seen the movie Scoop. Then i rewatched the interview...Gillian Anderson looks so much like Emily Maitlis And the movie is good. / []
I don't understand why this interview has been deemed catastrophic for Prince Andrew.  He appears forthcoming. / ['He appears thoroughly incompetent.']
i reckon he's lying folks / []
Incompetent at every level he should not be in charge of anything except scrubbing the sewers / []
Just watched Scoop and couldn’t believe he was so stupid, so now watching this and it for some reason seems even worse than the film, FS😂 / []
23:22 bs / []
I was gonna say... I'm only 12 minutes in and he's already fluffed himself over 6 or 7 times... He certainly doesn't speak like a human being... Rather something trying to convince you all that he is 😂 / []
Itscterrifying how stupid he is. To think that if Charles kicks the bucket and William kicks the bucket, this moron will be King of England / ["No, he won't be.  It will be George, unless he's too young (under 18) and then, wait for it, it will be Harry as Prince Regent, unless he declines."]
Anyone else watching this snd Scoop at the same time?! / []
Strange how he can switch topics from being accused of sleeping with under aged girls to his work on some project. Big fat narcissist liar. / []
I wonder why he was his momy's favorite son? / ['Because she knew he was a twit and needed all the help he could get.']
Epstein must have had some serious shit on this guy 🤔 / []
He wants us to think he doesn't know the difference between staff and regular people. Ugh. / []
Hilarious how he thinks he's good at lying but he's not. / []
He stayed at the creepiest man in the world went to jail for a horrific crime bc the prince was "friends with the girlfriend." Yeah, right. / []
🙈🙈this is difficult to watch / []
He really is a pathetic liar. Dirty, dirty old man. / []
Stupidity is forever. / []
Million dollar question: Why pay £12 million if you have no recollection meeting the accuser? BS / ['Ding, ding, ding.....who would pay 12 million if they know it never happened?  Then here is the question, when have people ever thought Prince Andrew was too honorable?', 'Another question: Who were his enablers in paying the £12 million and were they taxpayers money?', 'Standard practice in such situations, and after she got her $12million, Guiffre sure shut up real quick', 'EXACTLY !!!!!', '12m?!...Christ😮']
This idiot is guilty / []
A prince in name only. / []
“I don’t remember ever going upstairs and that photo was taken upstairs”  How does he know what upstairs looks like if he’s supposedly never gone upstairs? 🤔 / ['🤣🤣', 'Right and who believes that?  Prince Andrew should have point blank stated being a friend was a mistake.', 'There’s a bannister rail in the pic to show its upstairs, but he didn’t say that, and the phrasing is like that of a toddler’s lie.', 'LMFAO he is crazy', 'Prince Andrew is the mistake']
Anyone count the number of times he says "I"?? / []
SALOPARD MEURTRIER ET A DIRE QUE C'EST LE FILS D'UNE REINE POURRIE ET D'UN FRERE MEURTRIER / ['c est clair et les anglais idolatre leur famille royale pleine de merde']
Burn in Hell you Lying Dog ! / []
This oaf has been weasling his way back into public appearanc es with the Royals hope Scoop puts him back in his box / []
Whats with all his teddy bears too ? / ["That's a Dr. Phil episode."]
Hi from Australia 🇦🇺   Well well well the Old Duke Of York has dug his own grave now!  Will go down in history!! / []
I’ve never watched this interview till now. I remember the media and people shocked and laughing at this saying he just shot himself in the foot or dug himself a big hole. I don’t think any of that, he appeared to conduct the interview well and answered honestly and all the allegations are probably from attention seeking money grabbing lonely people / []
Scoop covered this so well! Bravo to the cast! / []
Better has gone to Pizza Express that day rather give this interview. Very bad, very immature performance!!!!!!! / []
Sheer beauty of language and silence.. that interview est d'une beauté infinie... / []
Did he call sex a positive act for a man? 😂 and for a woman? / []
Money / []
I wonder what his daughters think of him? / []
I’m sick of these pedos / []
why would anyone believe the accusations? shakedown tramp / []
this woman is annoying / []
He’s guilty guilty / []
"She says you forced her to sleep with you while she was underage."  "You see, thats impossible.  I was forcing another underage girl at the time to sleep with me." / ['yes its impossible i was being whipped with a wet soggy lettuce leaf at the time']
I'm watching this after the film on Netflix, but I still can't believe he actually said all that.  The fact that the royals thought his words were good proves how dystopian their idea of ​​royal life is! 😲 / []
It’s interesting how Andrew ran away to hide behind Mummy’s skirts in Balmoral when the legal papers were served 😂😂😂 Too bad he wasn’t hooked up to a lie detector during this interview😂😂😂 / []
If Andrew is innocent, why did he pay Virginia Giuffre out? Smacks of GUILT to me! / ['yeash, never under any circumstances had ever met her, but hey, lets just pay a stranger shed loads of money']
Andrew can’t sweat?! Yeah, right! And I’m a pink unicorn that 💩s rainbows!! / []
Moron Andrew suffers from selective memory! / []
Andrew has no recollection of sleeping with Virginia Roberts because he’s slept around so much that he’s lost count of his ‘conquests’. / []
Take a lie detector test / []
Oh please Prince give me a break you don’t have any recollection of that young lady you had sex with her / []
His doing a good job at lying / []
Repeatedly referring to Epstein as an “acquaintance” or a “friend of a friend”  yet flies to NY to tell him they can no longer see each other 🤨 / []
Prince Andrew says, “ I don’t know why people think I’ve partied” maybe because of all of the pictures of you dancing at clubs and.. sweating uncontrollably / ['And with telltale signs of class A’s with eyes 👀 like saucers']
When is this man going to be charged? / []
Assistindo em 2024. Alguém? / []
Why wrack your brain?  If you’ve never had sex with a minor there’s no need to wrack your brain! / []
Wearing “traveling clothes” on the day everyone left for Epstein Island— hmm / []
he is such a creepy man.. Like all p...does / []
How does he know it’s upstairs if he’s “never” been upstairs?? / []
Randy Andy never changed his stripes / []
“ what I was doing or what he was doing.” Suspicious!! / []
Wish you would onterview Beatrice, who was at the interview and convinced her father to take on the interview. / []
Came here after watching Scoop, well worth a look at. Was never much interested in Royal family because I don’t see them as having any political or economic significance and these are the things which impact our lives. However, watching the entirety of this interview begs belief: it is hands down one of the most absurd things I have ever witnessed. It’s almost fifty minutes of total bull****! / []
O filme a Grande Entrevista os atores ficaram muito parecidos com os originais , passada . / []
Absolutely dying at how ridiculous this is and how painfully obvious it is that he's lying. I'm coming here after seeing it on Scoop where I was thinking "It can't have seriously gone down like that!! That's obviously dramatised! He sounds like a little kid with all his silly little lies!" / []
Your honourable you say?? Doesn’t make sense. You see Epstein in 2010 to break ties with him…. But stay at his residence for days. Oh let’s not forget the dinner party where you were the guest of honour. The more Andrew down plays his actions makes him sound more unbelievable. Never believed you when this story came out and haven’t changed my mind. I find him disgusting especially having two daughters while he abused other people’s daughters. 🤮He should have been placed on trial but he is privileged as we all know. / ['I am commenting since watching the SCOOP this morning.']
Back for my monthly viewing / []
Have the Royals ever addressed this? I mean its a pretty big elephant in the room. Is their stance that he is a fool being in the wrong place, wrong time or have they completey wiped him? Nothing to see here, lets talk about Mental Health and another charity dinner... / []
Him and now "private" Harry with the wife show how entitle, stuck up and out of touch with reality this family is! / []
Lest we forget, the favourite child of the late Queen. If this bizarre and twisted, publicly funded institution were a dog it would have had its paw shaved and put to sleep years ago. / []
This shows how good the acting in ‘the scoop’ was! / []
What a narcissist! / []
33 minutes in ……. He says ….’in fact …..’ yes carry on Andrew with what you were about to say ……  I’m sure he was about to say in fact that is where the photo of me in the holiday clothes was taken 😂 / []
Subsequent pictures of him sweating, drinking, partying and in public displays of affection. You're a liar! / []
So surreal watching this. More incredible than any scripted TV show. / []
These comments are the best! 😄 / []
He is trash!!!. To think he is extraordinary  amongst extraordinary  people who are all scum. / []
Bad Titles  Sometimes, ancient places' honoured names, Are given, forever, to brutes and cheap dames. The good represent the titles of these lands  With the care and dignity history demands.  There are, though, many a titled nightmare, For example, "old Randy" and the "spouse of Spare." Betraying the house whose wide open doors By birth or fortune opened, in wealth and splendour.  The people of Sussex and York do lament Their names being flaunted without their assent.

Such a pompous, arrogant, uppity, lying idiot, “I’m too honorable.” 🤣🤮 AND HE THOUGHT “IT WENT WELL!” Dude, you are DONE, in the RF, none of them even want to walk beside you when they GRACIOUSLY let you out! GET YOUR FAT SELF OUT OF ROYAL LODGE, LIKE KING CHARLES HAS ASKED, YOU CANNOT AFFORD THE UPGRADE OR EVEN THE YEARLY UPKEEP IN RUINNG THE PLACE, YOU AND FERGS DO NOT NEED 45 ROOMS DOOFUS, LIKE YOU’VE BEEN TOLD FROGMORE COTTAGE IS AVAILABLE AND PERFECT FOR YOU FULLY FURNISHED AND UPDATED WITH 5 BEDROOM AND PLENTY OF SPACE! But your arrogance is in full display when King Charles has told you to move, now he has to pay a nonworking, jackass for all his household bills since QEII is gone. Royal Lodge is meant for the Wales family, YOU KNOW THE FUTURE KING AND QUEEN WHO WORK AND ARE LOVED, they are cooped up in 5 room cottage where even their nanny can’t live with them! / []
Liar liar pants s on 🔥 / []
The Netflix movie nailed this. The actors were brilliant 👏 / ['What was it called ? Need to watch it', '@swingham4020\xa0 Scoop. It Stars Gillian Anderson as the journalist who broke the story', '@alisonm7554 Thank you, im going to watch it today 🙏']
He would've benefitted more from saying that he spent time at JE's homes because he was a closeted drunk. Because of his connections, and title, and because he is an alcoholic, he had to seek opportunities to conduct his alcoholism wherever possible, away from the Throne. Therefore, due to his inebriated state, he was unable to remember, or be held responsible, for his actions at that time. He is in recovery now, but every day is a struggle to remain sober. / []
Oh...and by the way Andy...no believes your version...you are scum! / ['Nothing but lies comes out of his mouth']
Just watching the Netflix drama about this fiasco...gives great context...first Charlie and then this deviant! Obviously sexually repressed entitlement knows no bounds. / []
Hands up if you're here because of Beto Ribeiro do canal Crime SA / []
Gillian Anderson sounded like her version of Thatcher in The Crown more than Maitliis. / []
To hear that conversation he had with Epstein would have been interesting .If I was a close friend  of a convicted criminal that could  implicate me Id like to meet him also in person .In a place where nobody could hear our conversation..Andrew must have been quite anxious to take such a risk.The whole staying in Maxwells place because it was convenient doesnt hold water either when you are a multi million heir .He would have done better to say yes he is a close friend of mine rather than deny it when the evidence of him using his private plane and staying at his properties suggests otherwise. / []
¡Wow! 🤯, ¿qué habría pasado si nunca hubiera dado esta entrevista? / []
11:10 “I had to show leadership” 😂 … err, by having a walk in the park with Epstein and then staying at his gaff for a few days. Amazing “leadership” … such gibberish word soup. People don’t fall for this nonsense anymore / []
@19:37 He is claiming he can't find a bar in a night club??? / ['🤣 unbelievable is it not 🤣']
PA thought it was the honourable thing to go and explain why you want break off a friendship with a sex offender? No explananation is needed, except perhaps to pick up the phone and say f--- off you POS! / []
Saw this at the time .. watched the Netflix scoop .. visited it again … brilliant from Maitlis .. car crash interview by the prince … the lies he comes  out with are so transparent!! And the pizza date and the sweating.. I don’t drink .. etc etc ffs .. why is he not in  prison ? Oh I know why .. he paid his victim off with  the British tax payers money and the royal firm are bullet  proof !! …. And still the masses get up at 3 am in the cold rain to wave a flag at the freeloaders !! Unbelievable ! / []
i watch this for a good laugh! better than anything kimmel puts out!! / []
Had to comeback and watch this again after watching Scoop! / []
PERVERT: dissipated, amoral, narcissistic, fraud, not Christian, a liar and lousy human.  He deserves nothing from either the royal family or the citizens with Britain.  One can only imagine what was done to so many other girls and knowing the "kink" factor it is likely that beyond sexual abuse, death was part of the "fun" for folks on Epstein Island.  Andrew is a scum. / []
"The Key Element In This" / []
The woman refused him a foot massage because his feet were sweaty and stank so it is all lies / []
He’s such a creep / []
Scoop brought me here button  / ['Most people in England literally saw this interview when it was published']
The textbook interview -   Any current journalism course at University level will include this interview as a necessary course material.   Wonderful how she conducts the interview.  Her command of the subject.  She is relentless. She is direct.  Amazing. Amazing 🤩   The best interview of the century. / []
A scoop of an interview. Grilled to perfection. Medium well done. Thanks newsnogyt and Netflix / []
A gentleman the world's gone mad anything for viewing figures god help us in the future. / []
Isn't he the one who had a photo of his stuffed animals on his bed and required staff to reassemble said items on his bed each morning in accordance with photo setup? / []
This interview just showed what a narcissistic, arrogant idiot the guy is / []
This is interview is so damaging to Andrew and he did it all by himself,it’s almost like a comedy sketch if is wasn’t serious and disgusting shame on him / ['Indeed']
A shot every time he says um….. / []
'Unbecoming? He was a sex offender. / []
Todo vuelve royal family. Las Malvinas son argentinas / []
still so F. arrogant.   liar / []
Watch him squirm 😂 / []
This man; the audacity the delusionalacyof him during this interview simply priceless!!! / []
Scoop was so so good / []
Thing is, it’s not just him that’s delusional.  His secretary, the queen’s secretary probably, the palace PR team: all thought this was a good interview and approved it to be aired.  Jason Stein is the only one who could have stopped this. The world got lucky that Jason quit. / []
Cómo nuestros soldados no se cargaron a este / []
Watching Scoop on Netflix just had to come here / []
This A. HOLE should be in JAIL without a shadow of a DOUBT….😡😡😡😡 / []
He thought talking about Woking was funny, he had a sort of a smile on his face. / []
Woking pizza got a plug. / ["in the aftermath of this interview I believe they were inundated with customers wantting to be photographed under the sign, 'Prince Andrew was here on the same night he went to Tramps where he met Virginia Guiffre.'"]
Imagine his Mother watching this interview.I feel sorry for her but mayby she is to blame for Andrew turning out a liar, a cheat and an obnoxious creep! / ['Yes, and his Dad would hardly have helped!']
It must have been his twin getting a foot massage in New York! / []
The best answer, it was a convienent place to stay.What a creep! / []
"I'm never going to see you again" took four days and a big party to say! !! / []
Yes, saying that he never perspires was so funny.. / []
Go and study business at a Business school f you want to work in the World of business / []
Up to that moment Andrew was so busy making money to sit for an interview.To me he made a big mistake as the Interview showed what a horrible human being he is! / []
The comment he made to Epstein concerning the attention he himself was getting is damning. His response should have been “you are a sex offender” / []
So, he remembers Pizza Express because it was such an UNUSUAL occurrence, yet he DOESN’T remember meeting, dancing, or shagging VG, because it was such a USUAL occurrence?? Got it. 😉 / []
❤️❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜💜 / []
The way he says "schedule" @0:42. 😂 / []
Someone was funding Epstein and Maxwell’s lifestyle and whoever he was trafficking children to was going to be paying him. Be interesting to see Epstein and Maxwell’s bank accounts and who paid them what. / ['these people don’t leave paper trails.']
This is still very questionable as to the possible real motives behind this interview. Firstly, I/we are not very trusting of the BBC as it's a private corporation trying to extort money for watching TV and so much false news. Secondly, what does the BBC gain from discrediting the royal family apart from millions of views. The views is not the main motive in my opinion. Ultimately, this is disgusting, and it's obvious Andrew is lying. He would 100% fail a lie detector test. The ordinary man would certainly be jailed and mentally be tortured for the rest of their lives but these 'elites' get away. People really need to wake up to what is happening to our society but they're too lazy and they may not be able to handle the actual truth. There is no fair justice system left in this country, unfortunately / []
How is this man still walking free???!!! / ['Royalty = above the law apparently', 'People who have a high political status never get any punishment for their actions. And they know it.', 'sta ti nije jasno? \nznas li koliko je to rasireno u zapadnoj "eliti"?\novi ljudi su zli', '@Dirrtza pitanje je vise retoricko, naravno', "He's prince"]
I dont like him on many levels but the photo looks wrong to me as his arm seems too long. Either way, glad to see the back of him. / []
Can anyone tell me if all the teddy bears with specific spots from the movie is what's actually on his bed? / []
Unimportant point but I still can't work out Emily's jacket and the buttoning up! / []
Who’s here because of the movie Scoop on Netflix ? / []
Gads / []
Doesn't it look like he's stuttering a lot? / []
Trump would’ve lied so much better TRUMP 2038 / []
Liar / []
when your intelligence is on full display 😬 / []
“ me, my staff. Have investigated and couldn’t find anything “ lmao wHat😅 / []
“Andy you fuckin round with them underage girls?”   “No that couldn’t have happened because I know I was doing something else and not that thing, no no, definitely could not have happened. And here’s the reason, I KNOW I didn’t do it. That’s why. Uhm. And because I’ve only been to Pizza Express a handful of times, I cannot recollect anything you want to ask me about because I do not sweat, because I am a vampire. Which is a medical condition and the medical condition never lies. And neither do I, for that matter. And if I ever did, I have no recollection of it.” - TL/DR / []
He only gave this interview after the pedophile was dead. I wonder why🤮 / []
I am a Prince of England, mind you, but, heck, Epstein house was the most convenient place!! cause? it was close to the Subway, which I certainly take! Cause, it had clean towel!! Cause, i could run naked around the house?  who knows!! interesting indeed!! / []
Cringe….such a narcissistic brat… I don’t sweat??? Taxpayers paid for his behavior. That’s a shame. Never taking accountability or an apology / []
The one flaw in Scoop is the speech the manager gives to the news team at the end. Just look for the video 'Scoop (2024) - HD Ending Scene' on here. Basically, "we uncover the real story and the victims a voice". Yet no one had the guts to expose Savile when he was alive. / []
He is a liar. Yuck. His friendship with the sex trafickers girlfriend is just as horrible. / []
12 million sterling later, for a girl you don’t remember meeting / []
I love how he keeps saying “oh it’s only because I was besties with his girlfriend. I didn’t really know him” tell us EVERYTHING we need to know 🙏🏻 / []
32:39 Lost it at how he says 'four times a year?' 😂 / []
Why hasn't the woman pressed charges? / ['He paid her 12 million pounds to keep her quiet. Something a very innocent person would do of course!', "@alexandram8189 Thank you but that doesn't answer my question. I'll google it.", "I believe the US has been unable to press charges because they have been unable to serve him with the proper legal papers. We'll never see PA's sweaty ass in the States ever again."]
When Andrew denied having a birthday party for GM and he said No, It was a shooting weekend.  I wish the interviewer had asked, Was GM at the shooting weekend?  And, was it GM's birthday during the shooting weekend?  I would have loved to see Andrew squirm out of that one. / []
This ages like a fine wine... it just gets better and better / []
Screen record this interview because you won’t be able to access it in a few years time! You heard it here first. / []
As Philomena Cunk put it, Andrew decides to draw a line under the whole business. With a bright red highlighter. / []
Painful to watch lol / []
I just can’t stop watching this. / []
how he is not in prison? I guess we live in a fair society - ohhh except if you are rich or and royal..then you are above the law / []
The predators are bustards, THE WOMEN HAVE  GOT THEMSELVES TO BLAME!!!!! THEY'RE TO GAIN SOMETHING!!!!!!!!! / ['Excuse me??']
If Andrew was in jail he may have to be kept alone since pedophiles tend to get killed by other inmates. / []
Can't stand him!  He should be locked up in jail but hey different rules for those with money. / []
You say you weren't good friends. But were you good friends? Yes. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣 / []
He displays that he is untouchable and that comes across very clearly / []
You can tell when the lies start- he starts stammering ur urhh urhhh / []
Such a deviate predator of young girls. Disgusting person / []
My takeaway is that Randy Andy likes little girls. The dichotomy is that when Trump says the same things about his buddy Epstein as he has in the past, Republicans bend over backward to praise him for giving a tremendous, honest interview, one of the best ever they'd say, defending himself from the persecution of the press.  Trump does this shit every day and Evangelicals (which ya can't spell without E-V-I-L) worship him as the second coming. / []
No es convincente de su inocencia / []
L’interview est beaucoup plus confrontant que le film scoop . Dommage que le film n’est pas sélectionné les « meilleures extraits » . Mais le film est bien documenté et bien retranscrit. / []
Ah yes, the old “shooting weekend” 😂 / []
I just watched Scoop and realized the movie was spot on 👏 / []
I didn't want to be "seen" with him. Not "I didn't want to be friends with such a vile person." / ['Yep, exactly. Almost every time when he talks about Epstein, he says things like "because he is convicted", he thinks they need to break up their friendship. "Because he is convicted", he thinks they shouldn\'t meet any longer. In the entire interview, he doesn\'t ONCE specifically talk about what Epstein was DOING, he only talks about "convicted" and "allegations". A normal person who\'s not guilty would simply be shocked by what he DID and be co-operative, but Andrew didn\'t say much more than "I can\'t remember" and "I don\'t know, we weren\'t so close" in the entire interview when being confronted with the situation.']
Car carsh- how did he think this was a good idea 😂 great viewing tho / []
Most families have one, I was my families f'up, I've slowed down a bit luckily. / []
His tie needs centered / []
Poor pervert! / []
Why didn't the police go to pizza express and ask for the footage of Andrew or evidence that he was there, because he wasn't,he's obviously payed the police off and are still on the payroll. / []
I bet any money this pervert was glad that Epstein died because a lot of the evidence went to the grave with Epstein. / []
Andrew only went to see Epstein  to get their stories worked out because they we're shitting themselves.😅 / []
the royal humiliation / []
Narcissism at its finest! / []
Perv 😂 / []
Ahhh! See that he loves to play the "dumbass" card. / []

Alguien la puede subtitular? Graziazzz / []
"There's no good time..."🤐 / []
The coroner said it was suicide  lol i bet hes a millionaire nw / []
Prince Andrew’s biggest problem with this interview, was opening his mouth.. / ['Repeatedly.', "I think Prince Andrew's biggest problem is that he is a pedophile", 'It started off badly, and progressively got worse from there.']
randy andy is such a liar ... privilege does not equal ethics/integrity/honour ... he should do as his mother directed him to, step back and stay in the shadows / []
I find this so very sad that our late Queen died knowing that this happened and had to help her son with the pay off  I just hope she left us in peace 💐 / []
it's so disgusting that men in power don't go to jail / ['Epstein did! 😮', 'You are so right!\n\nAnd to the answer above, Epstein was not in power. He was rich, but not in power.']
I could not have sex with underage girls because I don't buy drinks and I don't know where the bar is, and I have forgotten how to sweat. / []
A este no le cree ni dios, y cree que todo el mundo está idiota / []
Epstein brought extraordinary people together because they’re all just like him, they’re all sex trackers and paedophiles it’s as simple as that. / []
"...my tendency to be too honorable..." 🤣🤣🤣 / []
This creep was Elizabeth's favorite son? / []
Look at him squirm,guilty as hell / []
Scoop was spot on with this interview. WOW / []
Chomo! / []
Easy to check flights to where he has been / []
How many times did he interrupt Emily?…. About a thousand / []
I stayed with him because it was free that’s why Andy you are just a free loader. / []
Disgusting how he can be not in jail !!!🤮🤮 / []
I don’t know where Tramp is and I don’t drink.  I don’t remember ever buying a drink when I was there??? 🙄🙄🙄🙄 / []
Watching this makes me feel sorry for Elizabeth. How it must have felt to know that on top of having no morals whatsoever, your son found it a good idea to shame himself and his whole family like this. / ['It does remind me of when Charles was asked if he was in love with Lady Diana in 1981.']
If I had a dollar for every time Andrew said "You have to understand" / []
He constantly diverts attention away from Epstein by saying it was all due to him knowing his girlfriend Ghislaine. She's now in prison 🤔 / []
Scoop movie brought me here 😁,  though the interviewer didn't goes so far on him as media normaly dose BAU, but this interview been like double-edged sword, from one side it helped him some how away from getting a legal action regarding sexual assaults' on other side the truth partly  has been raveled. / []
Does he always stutter like this? / []
Andrew:  "And the date 'we' have for this ... "  And, yet, Andrew and the palace have NOT PRODUCED these date books for review.  Andrew AND the palace lie. / []
"Prince Andrew" : No , no, I couldn't have had a sexual relationship with her because at the time I did not have a d**k / []
epstein was murdered by andrew henchman or mummy’s guards. 💂 / []
what total joke of a man. total cover up. / []
If a dog damages a child they are put asleep. But if a man is injured a girl he walks free / ['Too true.  And the dog cannot speak so is acting in self defence.']
“Epstein wasn’t a friend of mine. I knew him because of Maxwell. Then. I went in person to meet him to tell him I can’t have any association with him.  Don’t forget, he wasn’t a friend or anything, but I had to meet him in person, stay at his place and go for a stroll with him to tell him our association is over. I still don’t and won’t say anything against him.” / []
The Scoop nailed this interview (aside from the real Andrew tried to charm his way with a few small smiles while the actor kept him morose to the point of presenting him almost as someone who is neural divergent). His entitlement in this interview comes through loud and clear. / []
He didn’t want them to be seen together hahahahahahahaa not that he wanted it finished ,just not seen !!!!!!! / []
He thought it went well !!!!! Onto once did he express sadness for the girls or their families !!!!! / []
Randy Andy loved to party.....Koo Stark was his big love!! He is so full of it! / ['EXACTLY!!! I am so glad someone finally mentioned his old Randy Andy moniker and his porn star girlfriend, Koo Stark.']
I was waiting for that thing on his neck to jump out and start making up lies / []
Bull*hit / []
he lost ne on the adrenaline/not sweating thing...perspiration is not even mediated that way / []
40:35 Reporter: "Epstein is dead" Andrew: "yes" (chuckles) / []
Who is here because if Netflix? / []
Yes, he thinks 'we' are all stupid. Well done Andrew. Congratulations on your privileged corrupt legacy. / []
I believe the girls, who are now women were abused by Epstein and the Prince. Even the telecommunications man who fixed Epstein's cameras, telephone cables/systems, on his island saw it happening. powerful. Why is everyone in Britain saying, "allegedly Andrew abused young girls!" Are they calling the Girls now women, liars? 😱😡 It's absolutely disgraceful! It really is.🤷‍♀️ No one should be above the law. This must include Andrew's family!😡 / []
Even a 12 year old can watch this interview and see immediately that Prince Andrew was lying big time / ['Yeah it would be funny if it weren’t for the fact that probably thousands of young people’s lives were forever changed because of it. It’s so sick 😢']
Why do all the spares turn out so horribly entitled, spoilt, irresponsible , deceitful liars - both prince andrew and prince harry / []
Dude is a pig...no doubt...but the interviewer is monotonous af and her incessant repetitive same questions are mindnumbing.😫 / []
Here because of the movie Scoop! Here in America we had no idea how wild this interview was😮 / []
hahaha I have a medical condition I don't sweat / []
He actually thinks he’s a smooth talker. 😡 / []
منو جاي من بعد فيلم نتفلكس / []
Here after watching Scoop 😜 / []
Guilty af / []
This was a disaster. His PR people should have all been fired. He divulged too much. He is a terrible liar. Funny how everyone blames Guillaine Maxwell. None of the men take responsibility. / []
Él supera toda ficción. Y esta entrevista antológica e inolvidable es una obra maestra del género "Desastre". La flema británica de la entrevistadora, por otro lado, un perfecto "bocato di cardinale". Uruguay / []
Prince Andrew is the Alec Murdaugh of the Royal Family / []
“I needed to break up in person” 😂😂😂😂😂😂. But he was only an acquaintance 😮 / []
royal lier pervert / []
what time slot is the famous quote?  about him not repping his side ? / []
The Queen was like ‘’ bro I fixed the guy for you in jail and this is the type of interview you give them’’😂😂😂😂 / []
44:41 That is the time you buried yourself and the royal family. Andrew, you exposed the whole truth of the royal family and their abuse, thank you. / []
not guilty. I believe his naivety / []
He's a bad liar, looks guilty, and isn't too bright. / []
Comedy Gold / []
The telephone was the Chicken’s way to do it? The only time I’ve had to “break up a friendship” it was over a very serious offense and the phone was quite a wise way to end it. / []
All this from a grown man who yells at staff about the stuffed animals on his bed.  👶🏻 / []
Scoop done well the actors🔥 / []
18:26 "These are the reasons why I do not want to be your friend anymore:" >??????  30 minute walk in Central Park.?  My Dear Andrew, not all the people are as dumb as you!!!! / ['or as cunning']
It was summer . Spring summer eh no earlier spring / []
3 to 4 times a year to see someone you don't seem to have been friends with?? ...and with the royal calendar... that's a lot of times.  Why does he feel so uneasy about speaking about everything.  And why does he say he didn't party, when there are pictures of just that.  He went to NY to stay at Epsteins apartment but then while walking he said "we can't be friends". So he had to stay at his place to do this?!  So many interviews in the past tailored and this one obviously was not. He is an idiot.  He doesn't have to.kmow where the bar was. He probably has never paid for anything directly himself.  "I dont have any recolation" Blame it on the 🍸🍹🍷🍺🍾 Liar liar  "I can't remember " does not equal it didn't happen. / ['It seems his legal team advised him to say I have no recollection. just in case he got caught later on in his lie.']
what a creep / []
I here because of Scoop on Netflix 😊 / []
Lyinnnnnnnn 😂😂 / []
"Prince Andrew, I come here this evening in the presence of a camera crew, your mouth, a shovel, and a long length of rope. Let's see what happens . . .' / []
Liar liar pants on fire 😜 / []
I love how the views have jumped 500k in a few days thanks to scoop!! / []
Unbeleiveable. One of the things he says is " as a man it is a positive action to have sex".   There are so many things you can say about this statement.  In the context of paedophilia, human trafficking and sexual abuse it is disgusting and innappropriate obviously when it can be taken to mean a postive thing.  What he is trying to say is that "as a man" he would have had to act/initiate in order to participate in sex, and that is why he "cant remember".   What slips off the tounge reveals an attitude towards sex implying that women *have* no agency in sex. That sex is something that happens TO women. Implying non consent, implying misogyny, implying a power imbalance.   Too much to unpack in this interview, royal family must be scrapped / ['✅']
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." Emily's face say's it all. / []
I can’t believe this interview was nearly 5 years ago. I honestly thought it was like 2022 / []
i am "Bernd,  das Brot". I have no arms.  ☝️😌 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
He’s lying his ass off. Above the law / []
What planet is bro from😂😂😂😂 / []
He beat around the bush! / []
20:21 my favorite part: Pizza Express party / []
And he never webt to jail😂 / []
I have no recollection or I can’t remember! Let’s think how much coaching that smirks of 😤😨 / []
He could have had an impressive and honorable career, but no.... he did himself in. / []
Interviewer "Epstein was found dead." Prince Andrew "Yep" / []
21:52, "how is she?" He's remembering her when he quickly says this. / []
He should be in prison / []
the bit I love is ´í had to go tell him we can't be SEEN together anymore´ so what your saying you have to be more secretive!  Is she lying? I thought the answer is obviously, I would never do anything of the kind´erm but no! I will avoid answering that. Media training wasn't good enough, we all know what you did! / []
He shows no sympathy towards Epstein’s victims. Also he says he “doesn’t remember” these young women, but he should be able to say “I’d NEVER EVER do it” 🫤 / []
Vem pela Netflix. Alguém mais? / []
When do we get to the part where Donald Trump is held to the fire for his relationship and interactions with Epstein? Why is he untouchable? A member of the royal family can be held to account, but Trump gets off scot free and runs for president. / ["You'll understand eventually. Trump was planted to gather intel.", 'there are many then. bill gates & clinton and some other big names.']
When he talks about his work, he sounds a different Andrew… / []
There are  people worse than Prince Andrew walking around doing shit. The media like hypocrites prefers showcasing the sins of Prince Andrew. There are many media executives who have abused and misused their positions. / []
Prince Andrew keeps justifying himself.  He's actually NOT very bright! Why expand & attempt to explain unnecessarily when no one is asking U to do so? 🤦 / ['Lies Lies Lies ! ! !']
He always says he has no “recollection of”, but never say’s “he didn’t”, probably a legal thing from his lawyers. / ['Yes, because you can\'t prove "no recollection".']
He says that he remembers going to Pizza Express because it’s a “highly unusual thing” for him to do.. spending time with minors is apparently such a usual occurrence for him that it became part of his routine 🤷‍♂️ / []
Epstein has not got any film or photographs of me with underage girls..as he's dead.😂 / []
Just even the way he talks... Okay bro. "I believe  you" 😂 / []
And this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1ysX2iLmA / []
"no, that is categorically false. it was merely a matter of convenience. i was simply passing through her vagina on my way to other places." / []
First time I’ve seen this. Just dug himself deeper and deeper as he went along. / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLcfpU2cubo / []
Now I know why people say Epstein was murdered in jail. / []
I don't understand why this interview caused him to be stripped of his royal titles and demoted to non-working royal status. In the interview he may have been smug, arrogant, self-serving pompous and insensitive, but what's new or shocking about that? He didn't reveal anything new, other some nonsense about not sweating and about a trip to Pizza Express, and otherwise just claimed to have forgotten everything else. Even if he was lying why did this interview destroy him? It was just a stupid ill-advised interview making him look foolish. On the other hand, prior to the interview he was known to be guilty of cohorting with Epstein and continuing his friendship participating in hospitality and dodgy parties with a serious sex offender and prostitute trafficker. With photographs etc to prove it. Yet he continued his royal life unaffected: that is, until the interview went out.  It is implied that it was the interview that destroyed him and not his reprehensible behaviour. It is implied that if he hadn't done the interview, he would still today be continuing his royal duties without consequence. He should have been destroyed by his continuing association with the Epstein scandal but he was not. Instead, he was destroyed by this silly interview. I don't understand why the interview was so bad but his conduct and behaviour with Epstein apparently was OK, as, apart from embarrassing him, there were no other consequences. / []
My lord, lies, lies, lies. That’s impossible you can’t remember that girl. We all remember the people we have sex with. Impossible not too. Such a fool and lier to think he could convince the public of his lies. We are smarter than you prince because we have lived real lives, not fake ones in a castle using other people’s money. My god you are a pathetic excuse for a man. In fact, you are no man. A child trapped in a man’s body who still has teddy bears on his bed. / []
Car crash of an interview 😂 - Randy Andy seems to appear to have a terrible memory!! 😂 - On the plus side, decent meal in Pizza Express though 😂 / []
The peculiar medical condition has me in crackers 😂 / []
2:13 he threw them all out 😂😂😂😂 / []
Alguien sabe si esta en español en algún lado???? / []
“Going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do” / []
He should have never sat for this interview. He didn’t owe anyone an explanation for anything. / []
I hope are all questioning yourselves. These are the people you honor and uphold. They have your money as theirs they have you as their toys . And you honor them. I hope you are all questioning yourselves. / []
A friend is a friend, and always be friend whether he or she is good or bad in other people's eyes. He/she is good or not, its a personal account. It doesn't mean that we have to take any responsible to thier behaviour because everyone has his own life, that no one can control others. / []
Vim por conta do filme na netflix e vou te falar, que atuação impecável dos atores. / []
Listen, I don't think anyone could EVER write such a script. Sir, the delusion. Emily is so strong because I would not have managed this! / []
My favourite interview ever… never gets old 😂 / []
4 years later and still zero meaningful consequences / ['He paid 12M to someone he never met🤣', 'I think it was 20 million. And Virginia deserves a medal as well for being brave enough to go against the British monarchy and win! I pray that you and the other girls can now begin o heal.', 'Because Virginia sold out.', '@PR-mg4zxDidn’t really win though did she. Sure, she got rich. But justice was never served.', 'Not true. He had to move into a smaller castle.']
And he was the Queen favourite? Son he was a bastardi / []
What about Clinton... Epstein great friend? / []
Liar liar pants on fire!! You can tell he's lying on so many levels. His body language, his face expression and speech. He wouldn't pass a lie detector test that's why he would need to consult his legal team like he said. Every chance he had he reminded her he was from the royal family as if they are so perfect. There's more evil there than on the actual streets. It's just easier for them to get away with it than other people. / []
And THIS son is/was Queen's fav son.  lol / []
Andrew is confusing position, power and wealth with intelligence. What a tool. / []
After watching "Scoop" netflix!! / []
I watched this when it broke originally. I can NOT BELIEVE they would let him do this. Did not see the notes, and questions. Was not intensely coaches on public speaking and public interviews. Biggest idea. How about film it yourself, with your own staff, and then pr it to the news broadcaster. / []
I informed authorities that a couple of children told me that their mother was abusing them sexually. Instead of that woman go to jail ,  then the people who interviewed the children wrote on their reports that apparently I coached the children to say what the children said .       FOR REAL ?   THAT IS JUSTICE ?     On the case on prince Andrew Ibdont have comments . I don’t know anything about him . If prince Andrew or someone else is able to help me with money for lawyers for me to defend the children , just let me know here . / []
He did it 10000% / []
Wow / []
Hournerable is a word that he uses all the time. His mindset being hournerable to a psyco. Hournerable.......And he was not at all showing to be an hournerable gentleman thinking about the victims. You are not hournerable, Andrew!  Any hournerable dead Briiish man is turning is turning in his grave. Any living hournarable British man despice you. / []
Wow! The scoop did a really good job reenacting this interview!!! / []
Scoop had me here!!!!!!! / []
Gotta give BBC credit for keeping comments open on this one / []
The guy is an Imbeci!!!! / []
Her: Do you trust Jeffrey?  Him: What’s a Jeffrey? / []
Nasty individual. Protected by the mockery I mean monarchy.. Scoop brought me here! / []
Disgusting, Despicable feeble man. Protected by the Mockery. I mean monarchy. Disgusting enablers. This tramp should be in jail. Scoop brought me here. / []
This was a set up….I can not believe “The Institution”, the Crown never saw this coming….In my mind it was the only way to get him out of the way. He is so delusional, that this was the only way to get him kicked out, let him talk, and him thinking that he is amazing at lying. Without this, with the Queens support he would have stayed longer and damage de image of the royals. / []
She's a smart women, good job! / []
I never saw anyone lying so badly! You almost feel sorry for the guy 😅 -  You can tell he is used to getting his way with no effort… / []
Pizza Express in Woking should have a sign on the door. Randy Andy was 'ere! Xx / ['they might lose business.']
seeing this interview after scoop and can tell its bloody hilarious, I've never listened any interview complete that's this long....he himself ffd him over this interview...guilty is all over in his body language. lol / []
Lmao It kills me when he says just not talking to him anymore after the allegations came out would have been the chicken thing to do lol and then she goes on to say well you were seen spending 4 days there 😂😂lol well it was a convenient place to stay 😂😂 / []
lol he would not sweat  because of the falkland wars. amazing / []
“I don’t sweat”  that’s probably the lamest excuse that’s ever been uttered considering his status!! Wow / []
Anything happened to him yet then / []
What a pig . He should be in jail. / []
28:38 how did he know virginia already left for the island if he never met her?! Or was he talking about others? / []
Has anybody clicked that this is the brother of the King of England... / []
when I want to unfriend someone I just hit unfriend in FB or block them on my phone-  this guy is so polite to spend 4days to his friends house, fly to his jet to another country to say "we can't be friends" / []
Scoop brought you back😅 / []
He didn't want to do it the way a chicken would? So if he's not Chicken Little who is he? Henny Penny, Ducky Lucky, Turkey Lurkey? I alwys think of him as some sort of Pork bi-product. / []
who else just watched the scoop???? / []
He's a veteran of the Falklands war, something I never even heard of until I looked up what war he fought in.  It was a war between Argentina and the U.K. for control of the Falkland islands, a set of islands (rather far) off the coast of Argentina.  907 lives were lost, most of them being from Argentina, and the U.K. won.  Today, it is a self-governed British territory, the leader of whom is a governor appointed by the British monarch.  It has a only about 3,000 people living there and the only official language is English. / []
The actor in Scoop looks more credible than this guy / []
Its like a bad job interview / []
Look at his eyes in the photo he was drug for blackmail / []
Yo no entiendo inglés ( no me hace falta….), al no entenderlo  le noto q MIENTE, el lenguaje corporal no engaña. / []
Chocolate Feast / []
Nspcc 😮 omg / []
Never seen or heard so much dirt and hypocrisy in 30 min. Considering the strickt rules the english royals abide by I cant believe is one of them. Good to know who your tax money is benefiting. / []
Prince Andrew was better friends with Ghislaine Maxwell (wanted to learn business thru her,  sent invite to her)  but needed to break up with Epstein in person.  Ok buddy. / []
….my tendency to be…….too honourable. What a dimwit. / []
Why is Andrew the only one facing this kind of scrutiny? Loads of other dignitaries visited Epstein. / []
Don't forget Harvey Weinstein was also at that "Shooting Weekend".  "New photos show accused rapist Harvey Weinstein posing with late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell at a royal party thrown by their scandal-scarred pal Prince Andrew." / []
I don’t ‘party’. Ok here’s a picture of you going mental at epsteins party / []
You should face jail / []
People often say that the internet is forever. / []
So many people told me that this interview was like incredible... but Im actually pretty impressed by him coz if he s lying he is very well composed and handles the interview strongly! I thought he would be in pieces and she would attack him more, Im a bit dissapointed coz I was expecting something really powerful. / []
“Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.” oh emily maitlis the woman you are / []
This is so embarrassing .. 🙈 you flew across the world to end a friendship / []
Well, funny how time changes perception. / []
Hahahaha / []
I'm sorry, he "racked his brain" to remember if he did or did not sleep with a girl sex trafficked by Jeffery Epstein? That's not something you should find difficult to remember or not. / []
This interview is so ridiculous and borderline useless.  The entire interview is him just denying everything.  Yes I knew Epstein and I stayed at his house BUT I never saw, heard, smelled, ate, touched, felt, brushed up against ANYTHING!!!!  He is so blatantly lying that he is mocking us and making himself look completely incredulous.  That comment about just being too honorable actually made me throw up a little bit.  What is this a job interview?  Employer: "Tell me your greatest weakness."  Interviewee: "That I am just TOO honorable."  If I could roll my eyes any harder they would disappear in the back of my head. / []
“He didn’t go into any great depth in the conversation about what I was doing..what HE was doing” at 10:15   Wow. / []
Straight white billionaire privilege in action. Its worse now / []
He banged a few ho’s  at Epstein house. So what! / ['Sex trafficked teenage girls and young women, not "ho\'s". On the island and in the house of a child sexual predator, who was his friend. Sorry, but what tf are you on about?']
Say what you will….. he got away with it… 🤨 / []
Yes, this was a terribly slow car crash happening in jaw dropping reality. Emily was superb with her pressing, well paced interview style. The bloated, entitled, blustering ego of Prince Andrew looks extremely incriminating. Not a word of sympathy for the victims of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes. / []
The son of theQueen of England needed a sex offender pedophile to “learn” about business affairs and have a “convenient” place to stay in NYC 😂😂😂 / []
Funny how he tries to acquit himself appealing to the fact that he was friends with GM and Epstein was + 1, and now GM is convicted of same crimes. I wish there was another interview now 😊 / []

hahah so me / []
For a guy who'd of been thoroughly media trained since birth, being a "royal"... He's absolutely USELESS in this entire interview 😂😂😂 Its incredible how dumbminded this guy really is... He really thought he could do this incriminating interview (its basically a courtroom for 2 people a judge and criminal) and word and trick his way out of it infront of the world. / []
Its all Samantha McAlister's work, Admirable / []
How anyone can defend Andrew is crazy to me since its so obvious he' lying & was 💯 involved in this tragic story / []
There's so much more interesting material in the full interview that wasn't in the movie. But I get it, there's no way they could have fit everything in, but it's crazy how much more he messes up in the real thing. / ["That's what I'm here for 🍿"]
He has a face you want to punch 👊 !  The teddy bears on his bed kill me....what a loser! / []
Why would you explain yourself to a convicted criminal. Youd just cease all contact / []
He licks his lip after every lie like the lizard he is / []
"My judgement was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable." / []
I am here because of Netflix / []
It’s incredible that he never really condemns Epstein’s actions when they’re mentioned. He just says he had no idea.. that’s surely some evidence of guilt at play / []
Two interesting obvious lies. He says he's never been to Tramps and doesn't even know where it is or how to get there but then later says he's never ordered a drink anytime he's been in Tramps.  Later when he denies going to Epstein's Palm Beach house Emily says he was seen there 4 times a year. He denies going there 3 or 4 times a year saying he'd only been there 4 times in total. Why did he feel the need to correct the 4 times a year allegation to 3 or 4 times? Obviously it's pretty much wall to wall lies but these slip ups interested me / []
I can’t believe that, in this day and age, people still have monarchies. Sophisticated people? / []
it's was not a party, it was 10 people dinner, it was not a invitation to Sandringham it was only a shooting weekend, it's so obvious 😂😂😂 these poeple live in some another dimension / []
Ptince faces are Priceless 😅😅😅 / []
Royal pedophile !! We also have the royal Nazi his mom who gave the salute and her grandson Harry who had a swastika !!! It must be amazing to a proud Brit Loyalist!! Wait a second!! They have no recollection and don’t swear 😅 / []
"We werent good friends. I only went to see him on the other side of the world a few times a year." I dont even travel to see family a state or two away that often. Anyone you travel that far to meet 2 to 3 times a year is your bestie. / []
To be this unaware of how disgusting this guy comes off is puzzling. An honest person would be outraged if they were being accused of such things. An honest person would not, under any circumstances go in person to let the sex trafficker know he can't be friends anymore. If anything, they wouldn't tell them anything. It would just be over. And finally, an honest person would be outraged about the atrocities committed against these young ladies, and yet none of that was conveyed. He, infact, is still grateful for the friendship. If he is mad about anything, its that Epstein was caught and he could no longer not sweat over all these young girls. I digress. Put him in jail. / []
49:20 / []
the longest 1 hour of this man life he look like a decent man though just bad company I believe / ['That is not a decent man. Quite the opposite.', '@alexlazzerly3677 yes indeed sir i said look like a every one have monster inside with power they just get free']
These people that are lying when there's proof just don't realize they look and sound like a 6 year old caught in a lie.. wild. Own it.  Nuts / []
Like if your NOT GAY / []
Hay varias incongruencias. Si no es tu gran amigo y los ves 3 veces al año, y eres mas amigo de su novia.  Porque viajas al otro lado, sales a caminar y le dices que ya no seran amigos, te quedas en su casa, asistes a una cena.  Y su novia? No hablo con ella si era la amiga y que le dijo. Conclusión quiza si cortaron amistad de manera amistosa pero este señor tenia más miedo que dijo o ha donde iba el juicio probablemente porque tenían negocios en común mas alla de las chicas que le daba sexo.  Es decir este señor es obvio que el sabia los negocios turbios pero mas le daba miedo que Epstein se le saliera algo sobre el.  Por eso no lo corto por telefono. Mentiroso. Que su ética honorable jajaj no tiene solo conexiones le importan y por eso no le importaba relacionarse con el.  Y por se escucha la entrevista mentirosa porque falta contexto, verdad, y notar que si bien no violó si se involucró en alguna ocasion con mujeres y sabia lo que ellos hacian.  Dice, que Epstein tenía conexiones jajaja y acaso el no es importante como para obtener esos contactos por su cuenta.   Sii se nota desconectado de la realidad de alguien que no ha tenido que ser cuestionado por el pueblo y alguien que nunca ha dado cuentas de sus actos.  Muy tonto o muy culpable!! / []
Am gerrin the word.....😂 / []
48:08 she wants to smack the shit out of him / []
You can see Emily get angry at 48:08... / []
Its crazy that his own daughter knows he is lying and they never went to Pizza Express that day.. / []
he is dumb. also, now ghislaine is in prison his friendship looks even worse / []
Another Scoop watcher matching how really cringy and accurate the depiction of the film was😵 / []
Stupid guy disgusting / []
Is the Royal family a really ugly? Disgusting Liars I I can't stand none of them / []
12 million dollar payoff and he is off the hook??? Absolutely disgusting what this society has come to. / []
Chilling resemblance with scoop. Perfect nuances. / []
The queen only said yes to this release well aware this was a train wreck and the excuse shell need to cut him out 😂 / []
🔥💥🚂🚃🚃 / []
The tie knot is a subtle act of foreshadowing: def not a full Windsor that... :) / []
This creep needs to be sent to court and if found guilty..JAIL! / []
Despite the following;  1. His relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein 2. His admissions here of his close friendship with Ms Maxwell - who has now admitted to being a fixer for Epstein's sex trafficking rings 3. The complete BS he spins in this interview 4. The £12 MILLION settlement he paid to a woman - accusing him of rape - but who he claimed he never met 5. His refusal to face questioning from the DA in NYC 6. The fact that his titles have been stripped BY HIS OWN FAMILY  Despite all of this....there are many members of the general public who still advocate for this man's innocence.   He is disgraceful yes - but ultimately he has been shielded from prison by his status.  What is far far more disgraceful is the support he is given by everyday people - especially women or people who have daughters - who despite the clear cut evidence against him - continue to claim that the women accusing him are liars.  I have witnessed some supporters of this disgusting man argue that he couldn't have raped any of his accusers because they were old enough to know what they were doing and even that they 'looked older than they actually were'.  Remember all these 'excuses' ignore the fact that Andrew knew these girls were being sex trafficked by his good friend Jeffrey Epstein and his even better friend Ghislaine Maxwell. / []
A metropolitan group of really sleazy and perverted wealthy guys 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤢 / []
the "quite rightly" as a response to girls speaking up really threw me, as feigned as it was i think it was the only comment he made that wasnt about himself. / []
Guiltyy!!!! / []
youd think with 6 months to prepare hed be a little less flustered... / []
He's is such a ridiculous character, how can he clearly participate on those crimes and not be able to say that Virginia is "lying" in this interview??? It's like he's trying to keep his councious clean after all that he and the Epsteins have done, but at the same time he doesn't care at all about the crime itself... its's SO stupid and f****** up. He is one of the most coward disgusting people I have ever seen / []
Woking has no recollection of having the Prince in the town, and Pizza Express denies ever selling Pizza. / []
yes the bar in nightclubs is famously hard to find. / ["You're missing the point. \n\nTramps had a very 'exclusive' VIP area which was table service only with no bar. \n\nIt's for 'normal' people to go to the bar not Princes'."]
It's like an SNL skit 😭😭🔥 / []
How does someone with that kind of money not want to get their teeth straightened!? 🤣 / []
🖐🤚 / []
I like the way at the beginning he tries to make it out he was only drawn to jeffs parties because it was all academics etc yeah right at that point i knew he was bull sh itting / []
Relembrando essa entrevista. Depois que assisti  #AGrandeEntrevista na #Netflix  #ScoopNetflix / []
Most of man from Winsdor family seems idiots / []
What a peace of sh*t he should be in jail. Corruption / []
Pinocchio 😂😂😂 / []
His face gets redder and redder everytine the interviewer talks about him having sex with the girl, his face does defo sweat, his facial expressions are too much that dosent go right with someone telling the exact truth.... / []
At least his mummy loves him! not.... / []
Somehow no one seems to have noticed 13:40 his HUGE facial expression when she mentions this witness’ name, and he immediately goes to full denial. Why? It’s just a name. Yet when she mentions the foot massage he’s not as shocked. Odd isn’t it, that the face of being caught has a bigger reaction than the face of a “false” accusation. / []
My God ,the lies he tells 😠 / []
It’s actually funny how entitled he thinks he is . . . The start of the royal family downfall 👏🏽 / []
I think he was set up by the US government to smoke screen for Clinton and Bill Gates. / []
I am here after Scoop netflix shame on you Andrew! / []
Resemblance in Scoop is profound😂 / []
Try taking a shot every time you hear you have to understand / []
What a waste of  taxpayer s money / []
I have a medical condition so it means I did not sweat when I had sex with the teenager.  What a sad man.  No one will cry at his funeral. / []
Stupid Boy........ Harry, Andrew.... / []
The most STUPID Royal after the interbred Charles II of Spain of the House of Hapsburg. Such a shame comes out just once in 300 years! / ['Their blowing smoke in your face.   Jeffery Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell inherited this operation from his father Robert Maxwell, he use to be owner of the Sun tabloid.  He was an asset for Mossad. This was part of their "Blackmail" operation.']
Reminds me of that brilliant clip in little Britain with the m.p in the public toilets and his family in the back ground when he is questioned 😂 He doesn't recall I cant recall  It's that simple / []
As the BEST, Emily was quasi- perfection. The only thing she didn't ask him was about:- did you ever speak about the reasons of Epstein imprisonment?- This is something I've immediately thought after that interview. But I m not British, English, I suppose I m not prone to warship the royals as they do.. I've got another way of thinking, infact I've would never choose for Brexit, and they did. / []
I’m here because of Scoop on Netflix / []
I came to tell you "We can't be seen togheter" but I'm gonna stay 4 more days at your place. 🤔 / []
He didn't wanted to brake up over the phone with Epstein, what a gentleman 😂 / ['Had to spend 4 days to end his friendship by having sex with young girls']
“Do you regret your friendship with a convicted sex offender who abused hundreds of young girls?” “No." Says it all doesn’t it?! / []
Considering the RFs families policy is never complain never explain; it is mind boggling that this interview even happened. I mean good thing it did; exposes how rotten they really are / ['I think his personal advisor advised against it but prince andrew insists on going through with interview , encouraged by his daughters. I believe the advisor resigned after the interview']
I'm from Netflix! / []
I mean I don't know it is interesting / []
Do you see any resemblance with his and a  Stephanie Lazarus mimics? For me personally is the same / []
This interview has me in a chokehold every time. The AUDACITY of this man lmaoooooooo / []
Why would the bbc lose an interviewer like this…. / []
kudos to the scoop's make-up team!! The transformation of Rufus Sewell into the Duke is astonishing! / []
Andrew makes me sick. / []
Why did they show so many toys on his bed in netflix programme??? So creepy😮😮😮 / []
Emily You did a superb job with this interview😄!!! / []
He agreed to be interviewed then afterwards thought it went rather well. How incredibly stupid is this Royal? / ['LMFAO', 'all the incredibly stoopids?', '@Blacksmith1959 Extremely. Prince nice-but-dim Andrew', 'Former royal press staff called him an “idiot”', '@splinterbyrdnot nice, very pompous']
Guilty along with many others yet none are behind bars / ['Guilty of what?']
it was convenient to stay / []
Geez major EMBARRASSMENT! / []
Emily Mathis did a brilliant job as interviewer. Not afraid to ask tough questions, her facts were spot on yet she did not unduly interrupt or talk over Andrew at any time. A masterclass / ["Yes an expert job on Emily's part.  She had all the facts.  She let him talk, but would redirect with pointed questions asked in a calm respectful way.", 'I like how she let him interrupt her to talk nonsense. She let him cook himself.']
Not me watching the original interview after watching, "Scoop" 😅 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
I would like the reporter to ask more intelligent questions rather than accusatory.   I think society often judges the surface problem, yet neglect to get to the root cause of the why.   Someone needs to do a documentary on Epstein’s childhood, how he grew up, who where his parents, and why he ended up like this. / ['Interesting point you make. Can you elaborate on what sort of questions she should have asked?']
Watch this interview with the journalist and how she approached this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0x6G5AW6Uw / []
BBC= British Bullshit company! They should focus on thing western and British and stay out of India and its internal affairs / ['Fuck off what our media is doing huh .... Carrying BJP flags....grow up mann....\nAnd as an Indian BBC is what I trust more than any channel in this country']
“I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to keep in contact” *goes for a walk with him in NYC* / ['And stays w him 7 days', '@Tinih-nd8rr but no touching......lol, they touched him,sicko']
Suicide,yeah right, he was given the chop at the direction of his fellow paedophile like Bill and The man here himself,there was a whole lot of people going to go down when he went to trial so they had him dealt with / []
OMG 36:25 the most telling moment of the interview. / []
Lmao dudes a dumb ass r what ! / []
he lying like it’s a sport! / []
Well, given that he was literally taught over and over again how to gaslight and manipulate, bc that is how the RF operates, this display of insane narcissism isn't too surprising. Still grotesque nonetheless. / []
Opportunities to lure, not learn. Clearly Andrew is a bufoon. 😅 / []
For some who are not aware, both female accusers of Prince Andrew (gold diggers) were of legal age when they apparently knew him.  Additionally, 17 is NOT illegal in America. 17 is legal in many US states.. Each state has varying legal ages.  Some US states allow 12 and 13 year old children to marry with parental approval.  Regarding the Andrew and Virginia fiasco, here is the abbreviated factual context for the record sourced from documented news files: -   Andrew was another privileged simpleton (ergo, Harry) who, if one believes that the infamous photo is genuine, he knowingly had his picture taken at a house party w/ Virginia Giufre, who was of LEGAL age when she,  Maxwell & Epstein targeted him. Andrew met hundreds of adoring women during his early years when he travelled globally and often.   It is highly possible that Andrew met Virginia Giufre at the house party but does not recall her later: Virginia Giufre is but one of many hundreds of women who put themselves in Andrew's path not including those who were introduced to him by friends. He attended nightclubs & parties: many women threw themselves at him. It is well documented by numerous media articles and photographs which validate their reporting on Andrew's travels, golf, skiing & partying his way across Europe and North America.  IF the one, by now famous but benign photo of Andrew with Virginia Giufre had been genuine, he knowingly had his photo taken with her, smiling at the camera. Critically and relevantly, it is not the behavior of a man who thinks he's with a prostitute! That infamous photo has, however, since been proven by experts to be fake.   Unfortunately, Andrew acted without care and in inviting his then very wealthy socialite friends Maxwell & Epstein into his parent's quarters, he was very remiss in also taking their photos while his then friends sat in the throne room. Incredibly disrespectful of all.  Maxwell and Epstein were famous, globally renowned socialites & celebrities whom MANY politicians and stars knew and socialized with. Andrew happened to be one of many in their circle.    Virginia Giufre very strategically targeted Andrew many years after having met him and falsely accused him of S.A. She had planned to extort him for money with a story that Andrew had slept with her. Note, again, Virginia Giufre had been 17 years old when she and Andrew apparently met. If so, she was legally an adult.   Virginia Giufre only went after Andrew many years after apparently having met him. She targeted him only. None of her other wealthy clients.  Again, she had been an adult, of legal age when she claims to have met Andrew.   Although Andrew was willing & wanting to defend himself in Court, the late Queen did not want her family drawn into such a spectacle so she gave Andrew the money from her private account, NOT taxpayer's funds to settle w/ the demands of VirginiaGiufre, who readily accepted the cash and withdrew her threat of court action.   Because the majority of Britons had been embarrassed by this incident, the late Queen set the example of symbolic regret for her people by stripping Andrew of his military titles and Patronages. He served during the Falklands War so he was allowed to keep his medals.  Andrew's arrogance  - like Harry’s  - flunked the T.V. interview however.   Andrew is now only seen at private events with the Royals as family.    UPDATE 2023: Virginia Giufre, whom many refer to as a repeat liar  is now being accused of sexually assaulting a young woman and of attracting & grooming other young women.  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10899771/Prince-Andrews-accuser-Virginia-Giuffre-accused-sexually-assaulting-woman-Epsteins-direction.html   USA Judge Dismisses  Virginia Giufre Case Against Prince Andrew 2023   https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-accuser-lawsuit-settlement    Update. Another Epstein girl has exited the closet and is only now making accusations of SA against Andrew: the same M.O. and goal as that of Virginia Giufre. Johanna Sjoberg is now alleging the prince groped her at Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 while playing with a comic puppet of himself. Buckingham Palace had previously said her allegations are "categorically untrue."   https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-documents-1.7074336  This latest woman to stake a claim against Andrew was also of legal age when she knew Andrew and targeted him. She "sat on his lap". She knew what she was doing. Now, decades later she too is looking for fame and fortune.    Regardless, Prince Andrew's reputation is completely unsalvagable. He must retire and go peacefully into the sunset along with the untrustworthy & unproductive Beatrice, Eugenie, Harry & Meghan. They will never again be a Working Royals. Finis.  Show them the public approval ratings (or lack thereof if they do not comprehend).  The major difference between Bunker Harry & #PrinceAndrew is that  Andrew NEVER bullied, abused, lied about or slandered his family out of envy, for revenge, fame and fortune.   Prince Andrew NO longer has 24/7 police protection.  He has ONLY what Harry should receive and it is on an As Needed Basis per King Charles sharing of HIS Security Services.    Charles and family must show a united front.  Andrew's ex wife earns her own living as a successful author. The two if them will be fine.  As for Beatrice & Eugenie, cut ties with them as well. They can NEVER be trusted per their behavior towards Catherine & William and their historic alliance with the Duplicitous Duo, Harry & Meghan who must also be cut loose.    Meghan Markle to be called in Court Deposition against Prince Andrew re. Virginia Giufre and their Yacht Girl days with Jeffrey Epstein.  Quote from the lawyer, Mr. David Boies about calling on #MeghanMarkle in a Court Deposition against #PrinceAndrew because she "knew him well and saw everything"...!!! 👀  https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-could-testify-in-prince-andrew-lawsuit-lawyer-says-2021-12  Many have for long suspected that Meghan Markle was deliberately placed in the path of dim #PrinceHarry by nefarious powers. #MeghanAndHarryEXPOSED could be capable of anything, to be enemies of the state and for certain they are of the #BritishMonarchy .

If you know that someone has done something To children/ To young Girls And you keep reconnecting With this person; We can only come to the conclusion that you are just like the person that you keep reconnecting with .This is so disgusting.He should have been jailed😟 / []
Watched The Scoop for Gillian… searched this as a result. What a fuck&ng sicko! Sex is a possible action for a man and I had to search my brain because I’d remember a positive action WTF?! If I was able to answer in a sensible way?! Are you fuckin$ retarded?! Sick fu€k! BS on these rich spoiled children and adults in this family! Barf on their tolerance / []
‘When someone reminded me of Woking. Ah yes I remember that’😂😂😂😂 / []
SCOOP MOVIE 🔥 / []
Didn't/doesn't the palace have people that vet on his behalf?  I mean the common man in the UK doesn't have this privilege but he did. / []
Very professional interview must say she is very good and has ball’s  of steel the way she handled this interview with this born Liar prince Andrew the odd ball ,,   Best woman the BBC ever employed  God bless her in her great work,,   The woman is a Legend so she is,,❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Pathetic! As the other comments stated. He dug his own grave!!! Sad for everyone… / []
Positive action WITELF?! / []
lol oh Prince Andrew keep talking and dig more lol / []
Watching the interview was an experience that could be described as deliciously embarrassing and cringeworthy. With every awkward pause and stumble over words, a sense of discomfort mingled with fascination. It was like witnessing a car crash in slow motion, impossible to look away from despite the discomfort it brought. Each moment seemed to unfold with a mixture of anticipation and dread, creating an atmosphere that was both captivating and cringe-inducing. A disaster of epic proportions / []
Andrew "As it were i didn't sweat at the time, so i'm afraid to say there's a medical condition that says that i didn't do it, so there for.." 😂 / []
Anyone else here from Scoop wondering why Andrew's team didn't jump in after 2 minutes and shut this whole thing down?! Or at least beg them to delete the footage before release if the Queen and her staff really did get to listen first?! / ['They thought it all went very well!  lol', '@av1421 LOL i understand Andrew thought it went well but surely everyone else in the room could see it was a trainwreck?!']
How is the Royal family by default head of the church? As a family they are an absolute disgrace to every religion. All of them have had affairs, sex scandals and now a pedophile and the King who is on record wishing he was a "tampon living in Camilla's vagina" is the head of the Church?! Righttttt / []
After you broke off the friendship 11:19 he [Ep] threw a party to celebrate his release [from jail for sex trafficking a minor] and you were the guest of honor “No I didn’t go”  “You were invited as the guest of honor” “It was a small dinner party of 8 or 10 .. I was there”  🫠🥴 / []
Still don't understand why he gets police protection after everything he's done! Either take his protection away or give Harry his back. I'd rather my taxes go towards protecting Harry than this muppet  Don't even get me started on the fact that he refused to relocate to a smaller property.   I know Harry hurt the family, but this guy did the most damage. Guess it pays to be the Queen's favourite. / []
The BIG known unknown is the yet to be revealed actual relationship between Epstein and trump. Obviously it was a lot deeper and involved relationship than is either recognized or acknowledged. / []
‘I was president of the NSPCC but did not know he was a sex trafficker’. God you can’t make this stuff up😮 / []
‘Did you throw a party for Ghilsaine Maxwell at Sandringham’ ‘No, duh….it was a shooting party’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
It’s so misguided that these royals freeload at the expense of tax payers money and expect free holidays, jets, parties without giving it any thought about how this looks to the public. They are so out of touch it’s ridiculous….. / []
His hubris, narcissism and self entitlement speaks volumes. He thinks the docile public will accept any old crap that comes out if his mouth. / []
What a total Jackass.  Wow. / []
A I simply don’t engage in such actions would have cleared this up  Shout out to the “Badge” wearers 😂 / []
“That my judgment was coloured by my tendency to be too honourable” omg lock him up he’s ridiculous / ['Beyond.', 'That comment got me too.  I was like, is this a job interview?  Employer: "What is a weakness of yours"  Interviewee: "That I am just TOO honorable."  I actually threw up a little bit!', 'insanity', 'In the moral universe of this interview, honourable means going to see a convicted sex offender in person, not condemning his actions, regretting your association with him, or standing up for victims of sex crimes', 'This line has burnt into my ears.']
He's completely devoid of self awareness because his whole life he's been surrounded by people kissing his arse  When he said his main problem was being far too honourable it backfired horribly  It was downhill from there  You knew as soon as he said that you're dealing with a narcissist who believes his own bullshit / []
Boy should never had done an interview if he was looking to save his reputation….wow, you would have to be pretty numb not to know every time this lad lied during the interview…. / []
Okay, but we talk about scoop and how accurate it was?  😮😮 / []
I’m here because of “Scoop” and this is just crazy!!! The Queen knew dang well she was snatching those medals and honors as soon as she heard about Epstein. 😂😂😂 / []
The royal family ladies and gentlemen. / []
Soooo many things wrong with this man. I could fill a book. But one of the most insane and horrific, to the point of wanting to shake him and scream profanities at him, is when he describes his conversation with Epstein in 2010. Saying that he was ending the friendship due to the scrutiny on himself as a member of the royal family. That it would be inappropriate for them to be seen together. Not something to the effect of “you have been convicted of sex crimes against a minor; one of the most disgusting and heinous things a person could ever do; therefore I want nothing to do with you. You are an evil human being and I’m horrified that I ever thought of you as a friend”. He only ends the friendship due to the optics of it all. I don’t understand how someone could think that that makes sense and still consider themselves to be a good person.  The lack of intelligence and any kind of self awareness that would lead a person to think that it makes sense to say that he went to have a public, in person conversation to tell someone  that you can’t see them anymore. It’s inconceivable.   He says that we have to remember that at the time he was the patron of the NSPCC’s full stop campaign, he was supposed to be a champion for children. Yet there is no mention of him chastising Epstein during that conversation, defending the children he has been empowered to protect, not does he express any disgust in Epstein’s behaviour. Which leads to, why would he be disgusted if he, himself was exhibiting the same behaviour. He gives himself away over and over throughout the interview.  He is the lowest form of human. Someday he will have to answer for what he has done, even if it’s not in this lifetime.  He is the lowest form of human. I could go on and on but I will leave it there for now. / ['Yeah you perfectly describe the lack of remorse or guilt or disgust of someone who is a narcissist or a psychopath.', 'Well said.']
Hope the Behavior Panel looks at this interview. / []
Dodgy as a nine bob note sir !! I haven’t seen scoop yet but omg this is cringe !!😬 / []
Imho, he’s full of 💩 / []
Came here after Ted talk delivered by the anchor 😊 / []
He repeats that he was never “ that close” to Epstein yet wanted to travel to US to personally break up the friendship. / []
It’s just insane. Firstly the Netflix show depicted this so well. I never watched the original interview until today.  The lies are sickening. You are a father to a girl and you stay with a convicted sex offender for daysssss.   You just happen to visit him everytime you’re in the US but not for “massages” only for convenience. Like how dumb did he think the world was please? / ['The drama portrayed him as a well meaning, charming yet naive old bumpkin. \n\nBased on what I have watched in this interview, I cannot believe that to be the reality.']
Is this guy... Sorry the Honorable Prince Andrew... Seriously looking at a picture of himself and saying the other persons in the photos are inexplicable?! / []
Let's see what "A Very Royal Scandal " comes up with. "Scoop" was interesting but will the Emily Maitlis version be more revealing. / []
Royal liar. What a loser / []
Who gives a fuck if you came from Scoop Netflix. / []
"It was a convient place to stay"  That really says it all.   Who tf goes to visit someone and stay at their house, just to tell them you can no longer associate with them!? How stupid does he think everyone is? / []
Wtf he said at 31:33 ! Can we reopen epstein suicide theory? / []
maybe Kate Middleton edited Andrew into the picture / []
"It certainly wasn't a dinner party". 2 minutes later: "I saw him once at the dinner party..." 😂 / ['Also: "I was at home with the kids."\nLater: "I was at Pizza Express in Woking."']
I don’t believe him, he knew it all. I remember him saying to British press how he would enjoy facing Virginia Giuffre in court about her allegation then suddenly the case is dropped…he settled out of court…he knew and she had the proof! / []
This interview is at the same level of tthe one in which Michael Jackson said to Oprah Winfrey that he just had ONE aesthetic plastic surgery on his face. / []
So he went to him personally to say "we can not be SEEN together". So being together is better, is it? Gosh, can't believe no one from the RF was telling him to stop all contact with this man. / []
this will be imprinted on his tomb which will be as huge as his ego / []
Netflix brought me here / []
Emily ; " Did you have a party? "  Prince ; " No. It was a straightforward shooting weekend. "  That was incredible! 😂😂 / []
Are we sure this wasn’t a comedy sketch? / []
Bevause he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together.  Solution, he goes and sees him / ['But he’s cosmopolitan and honourable don’t you know.']
Mountbatten would  have been shocked at allegations  of under age sex. / []
How do u go from not being friends to having to “break up” the friendship? Almost in the same sentence.. / ['Barely friends just because of ghislaine but still requiring an in person break up. \n\nHarry and Megan barely got an in person break up from the family. lol 😂', "Maybe had a few things to go over with JE -- such as, if I break up with you, you don't have any compromising stuff on me, do you? Just checking.", '@PR-mg4zx More like the need to align their stories and collude in case they were ever called into a deposition together.']
Chillllleeeee this man is delusional!!!like i cant🚮🚮🚮 / []
Why is he not in jail🤔🤔, there is no way you can be friends with someone sooo long , sleep in his houses and not know whats happening, aint no way🚮🚮🚮🚮 / []
If he's never met her then why did we the British tax payers pay Virgina Roberts £12 million. Someone explain please! / []
This man comes across as almost unbelievably thick, I doubt that he has ever had an original thought in his entire life. He is also one of the most inept liars I have ever heard. It would appear that those who advised him that being interviewed was a good idea harboured a deep seated loathing of him. There can be no other explanation for allowing this empty headed, arrogant entitled oik to go before the cameras. / []
Scoop brought me here / []
Liar! / []
Netflix film Scoop nailed this BBC 👌 interview scene / []
Anyone here after Netflix film Scoop 👍 / []
28:07 prince smile, then he had controlled it. That was a play boy smile. / []
Sí, Epstein tenía una habilidad extraordinaria de reunir pedófilos en sus fiestas o reuniones, sólo le faltó decir eso.... / []
She’s brilliant !😂, That question about his release party caught him off guard 😂 he didn’t know where to start 😂 / []
Ces gens riches se croient tout permis c est honteux ce trafic sexuel de profiter de la vulnérabilité de ces jeunes filles / []
He missed about 10 to 12 opportunities to go back and condamn Epstein. He is digging his own grave and appologising Epstein. This is insane / []
Yoh. Why does the shrinking middle class still support the charade? / []
Emily Maitlis did a fantastic job here 👏 / []
Imagine how you'd all feel if he was telling the truth. / ["He's not though and it's obvious. What's your point?", "He's normally though and it's obvious. What's your point?"]
How's the saying in Britton, BOLLOCKS! / []
Here because of Netflix / []
Sad thing is he probably isnt that bad a person, jut got in with the wrong crowd / []
Outside walks = no mics. Ask John Gotti. / []
It wouldn’t surprise me if BBC turn the comments off soon following the premiere of Scoop / []
What a smarm / []
The communication director/PR adviser Jason Stein who was handling the scandal resigned because they decided to go rogue and take the interview. Bad move prince...the  ego gets you every time. / []
Why arent any of these people being arrested... wtf these are monsters in plain sight but we give them a pass because they are wealthy.... fuuuuuck that. These people need to pay otherwise they are just gonna keep doing it because they know the worst thing that will happen is a tv interview. And some bad things said about them in the paper. These people need to be punished. If that was someone like me getting those allegations we would have been charged and thrown in prison for a very very long time as it should be. / []
i just came here becouse of scoop on netflix / []
This is so hilarious! My daughter of 2 years old would be more convincing.  Here after Scoop. / []
Watched this interview after watching Scoop. Emily just kind of sits back and lets Andrew back himself into a corner and self destruct. / []
Because in the Navy, it’s a pretty isolated business because you’re at see all the time😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
The thing with the wall in the park is. No bugs, no tapping the line. Perfect way to end contact and discuss. 😮 / []
How is he Charles, Anne and Edward’s sibling?? / ["They're not any better..."]
Notice he doesn’t say he broke up the friendship bc of the Epstein did, but because he was CONVICTED and the attention and scrutiny was on him: / []
You do need to realise  that the morals of very rich privileged  people are not the same as normal people.they do believe they are above society  norms and regulations. / []
One of the funniest interviews I’ve ever seen- I’ve never seen someone shoot themselves in the foot quite so spectacularly. The complete lack of awareness, the sweat claims,Pizza Express…..and he still thought the interview went well 😂😂😂 / []
2010 contact with Jeffrey Epstein in 2010 there's nothing you could do to help you Recharger bringing those girls in serving time for whatever you and him done he was 7 time in jail and you and Jeffrey Epson were a part of that / []
Where is Jeffrey Epstein you and Meghan Markle have got Jessie and son collections you and Meghan Markle know where about you know you and Meghan Markle got Jeffrey on connections you know that you know that Meghan Markle has got Jessie on connection same as you you Megan are in the same boat stop lying Andrew you were there at those when there's ladies with her you were there on Jeffrey Epson Ireland so why are you lying for believe the word you say no believe the word you say that you were the Queen's favourite son look what you do to Her Majesty the Queen possible lawyer Andrew so stop telling lies just tell the truth you got to get shipped away from Royal duties yes there's a lot of business going on in the United States there's a lot of business going on in the United States what you don't tell the truth do you 2009 2009 word passes app convicted of soliciting institution Jeffrey Epstein jail for in Australia / ["What's that obsession of Meghan? This is an interview about Andrew and his long term friendship with sexual predators. And you for some reasons, try to involve Meghan Markle..."]
Car crash, absolute disaster. / []
Look how outraged he is at "4 times a year" 🙄🙄😮😮😮😮 / []
Even the tie he's wearing is trying to disappear to the side🤭🤭 / []
bro should have brought a lawyer, this was a straight up interrogation. Poor guy thought they were gonna ask about his charity work 😂😂😂😂😂 / ['Poor guy my hole']
Scoop is awesome! / []
It would have been better for. him to keep quiet than give an interview like this and leave no room for speculation. / []
maybe he thought he was going to be interviewed by Oprah, she always asks very difficult questions / []
He's an unmitigated schmuck. / []
Are you saying that she’s lying….. “well that’s a difficult thing to answer “ / []
The French had the right idea about royalty. / []
A finger of royal fudge is just enough to give the kids a treat / []
He was the " drip in the background ". / []
He wasn’t that good a friend but he had to go and tell him to his face about breaking up the friendship! Surely, he would not be offended if they weren't that close. He also stayed for convenience at his house. I am sure there were hundreds if not thousands of places he could have stayed. He did not want to break his friendship. I think he was scared of him as he knew Epstein could tell the world what he had done. Very sad! Great interview by Emily! / []
How silly. "I was in Boston". / []
No sweat ?😂 / []
His "tendency to be too honourable". 😅😅😂😂 / []
Total hypocrisy, a liar, a bully and a fool. / []
Big brother was also besties with Jimmy saville shame he’s never been interviewed! / []
Prince Andrew denies all allegations against a woman he first can't remember and then says he's never met. So why would he give her $14 million? To keep her mouth shut? Perhaps because he sexually abused her. / []
28:50 Andrew; ‘she, She, she’d … They’d already left to go back to the island before I got back from Boston”. How would Prince Andrew know where she (Virginia) went, or what transport she took, if he wasn’t there? ?? And later, he caught up w Ghislaine Maxwell, but he says they didn’t discuss  Jeffrey, except earlier he’d said that he only knew Jeffrey because of his friendship with Ghislaine. Too many lies and fibs and quickly made up stories to believe he could ever be ‘honourable’. / []
Poor liar ~ / []
He said he went there to let him know he cant be seen with him. So he goes for a walk in central park / []
Imagine finding out that your friend had not only slept with an underage girl but there were many and they were trafficking them. You wouldn’t honourably end the friendship, especially as a father of daughters, you’d be livid. You’d have him beat up! And when being accused of sleeping with someone when you are married, you don’t ask yourself hmmm did i? You know, there’s no chance in hell. He’s absolutely, undeniably guilty. / ["Unless your perenially feckless ex wife Fergie was in debt to the man and you needed forgiveness. Andrew and Fergiie were both perfect marks for Epstein. -- ever needing money, too stupid to have a clue about what is going on. I don't know how the men in suits or British security allowed this association unless they had some other agenda and were also totally incompetent.", 'Agreed!', 'Unless you are into the same stuff….', 'Underrated comment!']
what a crock of shit! There are court cases transcripts which show in detail the many times he hung out with Epstein. No United Nations peeps were invited to any of these shindigs at the island. / []
How many women have u had sex with. You should know if u did or didnt have sex with someone. Shouldnt be i have no recollection. It should be no  ive never had sex with her / []
Just finished SCOOP  And now I am here  What and odd man and clearly a liar / []
His truth-telling skills are on par with my ability to speak Klingon. / []
what a chomo / []
he tries to be so nonchalant throughout this / []
Google Andrew & Epstein's  Thai holiday on Epstein's private yacht and see the images for yourself / []
i need like a professional to read his body language / []
This interview was difficult to watch. / []
It's not a photo of me in London!...   Well, OKAY then.... / []
He should have been convicted. This is ridiculous. / []
Just the whole 🧸 thing  alone gives me the creeps / []
Can we get Emily to mediate our presidential debates? / ['I know she is wonderful 😊', 'Oh man, I would pay serious money to see that if it were to happen.', "There's not going to be anymore presidential debates. Trump won't debate."]
Scoop brings me here / []
The opportunities he had to learn from Jeffrey Epstein. This statement boggles the mind. / []
My 7 year old lies better…. / []
Just finished watching scoop, on Netflix, was interesting to see, inside, of how the media, got this interview,and those involved. / []
Anyone else came here after watching the neflix film "scoop"? / ['had to rewatch after seeing the film', 'No']
I can't believe anyone on his staff would allow this interview to happen.  Couldn't they see the landmines everywhere?  The first problem is the prince himself.  He's aloof, out of touch, insensitive and comes off nothing short of ridiculous and deceptive.  Couldn't any of his people see this when they were prepping him? The most surreal part is that he never condemns Epstein's crimes at all and at one point praises him for his ability to bring people together. / ['Why would he condemn Epstein?  He’s a predator too.']
You just know he thinking deeply about Emily… / []
Came here after Netflix "scoop" / []
I just wanted to learn the tools of my trade like a good working boy / []
This is where a lifetime of obscene wealth, privilege and zero accountability gets you / ['zero accountability. The British royalty- totally out of touch with reality. Disgusting. Revolting.', "Hear, hear ... But still it's beyond me how (apart from Anne) not one of them felt the need to really be a role model for a nation to follow. Charlezwas pathetic and the rest , huh. Willam is something else.", '@mohammadhayatca3244 God bless the King', 'Lifetime? More like centuries of lifetimes. \nI don’t disagree but What I mean is a lifetime of privelage is one thing- but to come from a lineage of privelage for a Millenia ?!?! Can u fathom THAT level of entitlement.', "You think its only this privileged family that are at it? Don't be nieve."]
We didn’t party, pedophilia is serious business / []
I have never heard a grown man say *uhm* so many damn times.... / []
She gave him just enough rope / []
Did you worry that he had something that could compromise you? No Did you regret that trip? Yes Do you regret the whole friendship w/ 💩? Um, ah, now, still not..for the “people” (young girls) that I met, and the”opportunities” that I was given to learn…” Despicable being 💩☠️💩 Not that close, he was just your pimp then, who you would have dinner parties with, talk in-person with, without Ghislaine, b/c he’s just an acquaintance (b/c of his girlfriend…), go for walks in the park and stay at his home. Virginia Roberts —> Prince Andrew ⚰️ / []
Says he wasn’t that close with Epstein, closer with his girlfriend, but he ‘simply HAD to ‘ make the trip to tell him they can’t be seen together publicly!!! Like wtaf?? That did not add up. / []
whos here after the netflix scoop / []
I’ve just viewed Scoop on Netflix so I came here and my God he was worst in reality than what we saw in the movie. Unbelievable. / ['I think they did it on purpose.  They left out most of the obvious zingers.  It makes them look tactful.']
People seem to laugh when guilty and being questioned. Someone innocent being accused of such things would take this so incredibly seriously as they told of their innocence. Nothing to be laughing at. / ['Any normal person can immediately tell he did it on that basis alone']
came here again after watching Scoop. Gillian Anderson played her so well lmao / []
Everyone knows he went across the Atlantic in 2010 to see Epstein   to plead not to mention him when Epstein got interrogated by the FBI and in court. It’s so obvious. 🙄 / []
Such an idiot / []
Whose his advisors....to conduct such a brutal interview talking riddles / []
Brain dead / []
He ridiculous / []
I know a few ostriches just like Randy. / []
I’m here from watching the Netflix cover - April 2024 / []
You don’t go through Palm Beach. It’s not a travel hub. It’s not a “convenient place” to stay. You need to switch flights to get there.   He was going there to visit Epstein and have sex with underaged girls. / []
Don’t know about him having a “thick skin”.  He’s got a bit of a think head. 🙄 / []
Her little smile when he starts talking about schedules...oh Andy you are stupid, no depth whatsoever. / []
👎2024, still history in the making 🥵 / []
Vaginal Virginia sure struck Gold with Andrew. / []
I cannot unsee that this lady is Gillian Anderson / []
I,too, just watched this after watching Scoop, and did so with a completely open mind. He came over as a most arrogant, unattractive person, but I was left thinking that he was possibly telling the truth! He would have been ‘advised’ to pay Virginia Roberts, as a court case would have involved a lot of other things , maybe untrue, coming out. I didn’t find her a particularly attractive person either, and the photo does look a bit odd to me. However, the sweating thing is just nonsense. I’d always thought the Pizza Express story could easily have been verified, as surely someone who worked there would have posted on social media, or contacted a tabloid with their story, but he just said he took his daughter to a party, but I’m not sure he meant that he spent any time there. Who really knows what did or didn’t happen. Epstein is dead, so could it be his alleged victims were advised to mention Andrew, as they knew his lawyers would advise settling, because the royals wouldn’t want the publicity? Again, who knows? / []
“you would meet acedemics , politicians , people from the united nations” .. yeah , all nonces / []
A video of a man lying for 49 minutes straight / []
What an embarrassing interview.  I just do not believe a word he says. He is a disgrace. / []
Emily is hands down, the absolute best interviewer I have ever seen.  This should be taught as an interrogation technique to law enforcement.  She is freaking amazing. / ['lol what?', 'You exaggerate.', "They already do use this technique. It's not a secret that only she has the power to unlock. 😂\nShes a good interviewer no doubt about it. But she's not the only one.", 'Yes!!! I wish she were a prosecutor!!', '@KristinaDisney What she does is nothing close to what prosecutors do.']
SCOOP / []
Nice try Prince Andrew. I hope you can get beyond the fake puritan inquisition. So many drug dealers and people hooked on illegal drugs with needles before the age of 16 and you have to deal with this bulloni. / []
oh my this is painful to watch / []
looks like he has a tumor in his second side chin / []
He's dumb as trump / ['But unfortunately for Andy he doesn’t have a cult.']
Vim depois do filme a Entrevista. / []
I take it that all the other pictures of Andrew with women at Epstein/Maxwell's parties weren't on the internet prior to this interview? Because there are many of him with another blond seducing him what looked like on a dance floor. 😉 / []
It’s painful seeing how much he’s struggling to lie…and so obviously guilty. And…it wasn’t only one minor. / []
I wonder what he did learn from those gatherings?? / []
... I watched Scoop only because of Gillian Anderson... I detest cringe in any form... / []
These privileged royal idiots think the rest of us have zero intelligence. What a prat. And a pedophile. / []
"but...but... remember!!!! that it was his girlfriend...that was the key element" .... tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are / []
it is going to have much more value later in 22nd century and after with future knowledge of biology, mental health and human processing of reality. / []
Wow after watching this a few times you really see his lies regarding Virginia...and he responds the same way when questioned about Epstiens death...he had Epstien killed...just wow how obvious this is. / []
Well if that photograph is fake then Prince Andrew can you please answer this question Why did you pay her 12 million pounds ? / []
That so called man is disgusting.   Oh that's not Royal. / []
This is the most recent comment, and NO, I didnt come here after watching Scoop, I dont have Netflix subscription, anyone here care to share their account with me so I could watch Scoop? / []
The arrogance… Oh my God! Narcissistic people are so convinced of their own lies. The interview is brilliant, she even did not have to give him the shovel, he took it himself and kept digging deeper and deeper 😂 He is so pathetic! / []
Watched 10 minutes of SCOOP Netflix & I HAD to come watch this first cuz I had not idea of this interview  !! / []
He’s not even sorry / ["Narcissists don't take blame."]
I watched "Scoop" last night, and somehow the real interview is so much worse than the film depiction. 😂 / ['lol yes… i didn’t think it was actually that bad 😂 but oh well… also, actors did a wonderful job', "Can't believe this really happened was this bad", 'And Sam said in an interview that there was so much more than happened at the time that they couldn’t share because (paraphrasing) it would be a career suicide!', 'Painful to watch', "Precisely. We already have the full interview, so why reproduce it in a movie?\nIt's just the media congratulating themselves."]
Who's here after seeing his flat ass on Netflix? / []
Just here comparing it to scoop / []
A Woman who is already sleeping with her so called boy friend, who choose to become a sex worker for money, Just coz she was 17 when doing so... Gets to say what ever she feels like to get the attention of the legal system and sue a man for 12million pounds.   Most of the time law is unfair on men on these fake abuse cases. Prince andrew is a clear victim of this scam.   Veginia shold be ashamed of her self. / []
“I dont sweat because I suffered from an overdose of adrenaline when i was shot at…..” is my favourite part / ['Oh me too!', "His reaction to John Brockman's name is mine.", '@cwcarson that was good too! It was like his guilty conscience just drove his mouth straight off a cliff. Yikes. If he was trying to not to look guilty this was all wrong. I still can’t believe nobody stopped him. Surely he had attorneys and PR people there, but maybe not because it was so bad. I bet the Queen was horrified. She was an amazing lady.', 'people are shot at everyday. Maybe the experience should be sold as an anti-perspirent?', '@hollyhenry51 good point! I don’t want to be shot at, but I’d love to not to sweat! It seemed like he had been making up that story for a while. He couldn’t wait to say it!']
How the British people have not revolted and the monarchy is astounding. / []
Wow Gillian Anderson looks so much like her x / []
Is anybody believing this? We all know you had sex with underage women and knew full well what was going on. What a disgusting individual who belongs in jail. / ['Sorry, correction - sex with underage girls. They weren’t yet women.']
This is the funniest video Ive seen in the last ten years / []
is there a pizza express in woking ? / []
Who is here after the Netflix Movie? / []
He manages to brag about navy, falklands, international business, thinking all of that is gonna redeem him. Not it’s not, you’re done ! / []
Netflix next, roll on scoop! / []
What a liar / []
The Scoop re-enactment of this is spot on and brilliant. Gillian and Rufus both excellent! / ['The Scoop is terrible. Why watch that when the real thing is available and so superior', 'In scoop Gillian is far more aggressive.  here the interviewer is cloyingly sweet and nice---wink wink', 'I actually came here to see how dramatic the show made it. If anything he is more dramatic here! WOW! Sick.', 'Yeh Billie sucks also as an actress', '@JuntusOrothon I totally agree.  I walked away with a feeling that she was a loser reporter.  But in actual life she is a lawyer and a very intelligent, powerful woman!!  Show or writing did not do her justice!']
"No it was a straight forward shooting weekend"... bahahaha sorry that most of us have never attended such an event. / []
He is just disgusting 🤮 🤮🤮 all of that kind of people / []
he must have some sort of mental impairment..... / ['Narcissism']
Love how he speaks to Maitlis as if sh'e a complete idiot. / []
Just a disgustingly Royal Brat, Enjoying Life as a Privileged So called Prince!!!! Such a horrible person / []
I would say, as it were, that Prince Andrew is, as it were, and was, as it were, a disgusting pedophile. / []
You only need to have a brain to realise there's no smoke without fire🔥  Plus, you don't just pay some random 12M who's just 'trying their luck' and has nothing on you whatsoever 🙄 / []
Why does he look so old? / []
38:51 what was that yelp? Did someone interrupt? / []
Scoop was Excellent, Rufus was Great as Prince Andrew!!! Never saw this interview, just watched Scoop, Excellent!!!! / []
this man is just stupid, a complete moron / []
'That is what I would describe as 'me' in that picture.' / []
I don't even know where the bar in Tramps is, so.... / []
I’ve never watched this until today. It’s like a pantomime. I live!! Oh, how I live!!!! / []
What a revolting,pointless, entitled, waste of space this person is. / []
What a complete puff piece.  This was the best way the propaganda, government-based media could allow one of their own to move on with his life without any real consequences.  Remember how the world really works for the powerful!!! They've created the rules to protect themselves. / []
Who else is coming here after watching the new Netflix movie Scoop? / []
Fallen, disgraced, pompous old fool. He doesn't have a clue how out of touch and ridiculous he is. This shows how absurd and out of touch the monarchy is, still imagining they are chosen by God. BAD, CRIMINAL BEHAVIOUR from a brat. Must be completely ousted. / []
2024 UPDATE: Prince Andrew was in contact with Epstein multiple times after 2010. Emails disclosed as part of a lawsuit with JPMorgan confirm Prince Andrew was in regular contact with Epstein and even dined with him while he was on house arrest. / []
41:23 "we all knew him" the whole royal family knew epstein?????? did he just slip out some secrets? this needs to be investigated / []
THE ROYAL FAMILY HAD EPSTEIN KILLED.  40:36. the way he laughs when emily says "epstein is dead" / ['Yep. On the money with that observation.']
39:52 onwards is television GOLD / []
the hubris of this man is unbelievable / []
The Caucacity! / []
not the "travelling clothes"😭😭😭 this interview is GOLD / []
PAEDOPHILE PAEDOPHILE PAEDOPHILE / []
Here 4/5/2024 pausing the Netflix "Scoop"  each minute of the interview to collaborate step by step the YouTube BBC interview ..This is a well delivered masterpiece ✨️  The deceitful nature of the character on Netflix absolutely matches the character on BBC. Incredible! / []
Hes a damn liar but i have questions for HER. She was 17. Old enough to know what she was doing. She could have left anytime. But she chose to hang around and have sex with him 2 more times? How about getting out of the house and going to a police station? The difference between 17 and legal age is one year. Not enough to make a difference in not knowing what your doing. All he had to do was admit that he met her and slept with her and that Epstein told him she was legal. Thats all. Keep it simple. The deeper you lie, the more guilty you look. Unless he WAS told that she was only 17. That changes things entirely. / ['Brother what??', '@bloom.11.25 \nBrother who?', 'You’re saying between the 2 of them she should have been the one to know better? Also one year is a huge difference especially in teenage years']
Her composure and methodical pace through the hour is awe- inspiring. / []
he leans on his friendship with ghislaine– who was a sex trafficker and pedophile..... can he explain his friendship with her? / []
A SMALL DINNER PARTY😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 the party celebrating epstein’s release was “only a small dinner party” 😭😭😭 / []
Emily Maitlis is a BADASSSSSS / []
If he had nothing to hide he would let himself be deposed. He also didn't have to stay at his house even for convenience after epstien was already convicted. He's guilty / []
This idiot and his simpleton nephew are prime reasons that royal offspring who have no chance in hell in acceeding to the throne learn a skill or trade. One wrong move and you don't get paid for just being royal anymore. Andrew's now just a deadbeat living off his brother. / []
A lamb at the slaughter / []
Him being tolerated at the Palace as if nothing happened is very disturbing. / []
amazing how accurately Andrew was portrayed in Scoop on Netflix... and horrifying / ['Just finished watching the movie and it’s incredible!', 'So accurate. It’s almost identical to']
21:32 Nail in the coffin... this is what happens when you let your EGO make decisions for you / []
18:23 Seriously.... this is why he had an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Roberts... because he didnt even know who she was.... BHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!!! / []
Im here again after watching "Scoop" / ['Same here! Rufus Sewell--amazing as Prince Andrew. Watching this confirms it!']
15:05 FYI... he didnt kill himself... you might wanna investigate MOSSAD to the real whereabouts of Epy / []
The / []
Im just here for the line "Going to Jeffrey's was NOT about partying" - Yeah we kinda know it was not about the party... it was about the fiddle play / []
Anyone here after watching Scoop. / []
We're all here today after watching "Scoop" on Netflix, aren't we? 🧐 / ['Yep 🤣Bet the Royal Family is loving this...', 'Yuup', 'Even though Scoop was dreadful', 'I’m here from Stavy’s podcast', 'No']
The speed at which he confirmed “Epstein was found dead.” Convinces me, the rest is untruths and half truths. / []
HAD HAD HAD to go and see his not so close friend 🙄 full o shiiiite Andy Boy. Anyway…back again after watching Scoop. Gillian Anderson 👌🏽 / []
“Just a straightforward shooting weekend” 90% of the country has never had a “shooting weekend”. Never mind with the wife of a S trafficker / ['Yes, I\'d be curious to know what a "straightforward shooting weekend" entails lol']
the world needs to do better. it took a whole village, so to speak, of silence to allow epstein to continue to do what he did / []
I’m royal we, we, not me, me, me. / []
if you agree to be interviewed by Emily Maitlis make sure you are prepared and dont let her good looks fool you. she is at the top of the game. / ["What have her looks got to do with her abilities as a journalist? Seems like you hold the same patronizing worldview that did so much for Andrew's credibility.", 'its actually a compliment to Emily. She is the whole package or do you think andrew would have opened up being interviewed by you? food for thought.have a good day.', "@mrp8811  Whole package? What is she, a parcel? She's attractive but it wasn't her legs asking the questions."]
Had to re-watch this after watching SCOOP on Netflix. The full version is so damning, the lack of empathy, the total disregard for any question given to him, a man who has clearly been used to being agreed with and believed on every level since birth. He states that he never met Virginia, he doesn't know her. Why, I wonder would one give 12 Million Pounds to a complete stranger who has "falsely" accused you. A shocking display of privilege, arrogance, emotional disconnection, a dissembling interviewee who had no thought for anyone other than himself and his own gratification. A National figure who IS and will forever REMAIN a National Disgrace. / ['Edit: man-child is more accurate. We also have someone on trial right now with the same exact qualities: former U.S. President: DJT - now on trial.']
This "man" is the most pathetic and pusillanimous human being I watched on TV. / []
I'm coming form Netflix / []
Watched snoop. Now I’m witnessing a real-life car crash / []
Who is here after watching the Netflix film Scoop? 😊 / []
The fact his advisors couldn’t see red flags in his answers just shows how out of touch this institution is with the real world… did they honestly think this was going to be his saving grace? He was given every opportunity to show empathy and it was pure narcissism. Amazing / ['I find it difficult (perhaps naively) to believe that this was signed off.', '@Coops5361 I think Andrew is so arrogant that he chooses to ignore the advice of his staff, and probably in a manner that displays the worst of his sense of entitlement.', 'In the movie they spoke of him like cult members. Praised his every word and action and they stayed in denial about the allegations. That’s a cult following.', 'He obviously ignored his public relations advisors.', '@RavenDots115That’s not indicative of a cult, it’s indicative of an employer/ employee relationship…..which is normal for a domestic servant.']
Not his lyin sweaty ass. #SCOOP lol / []
took a lot of searching to find this.... / []
I just finished the movie "Scoop" and I thought the recreation was uncomfortable. Wow! Absolutely the most cringeworthy interview I've ever seen. / []
Well. i just watched  Scoop so here i am . / []
When I was little, I use to eat dirt from time to time. My mom would ask me "have you been eating dirt" as its smeared all over my face and Sunday dress. Why did I eat it. I dont know, but of course, I had no recollection of doing that, despite the evidence.  😂😂😂 / []
Who else is watching this interview after watching Scoop on Netflix in 2024...! 😂 / ['lol - yep. :)', 'Came straight here 🤣', '🖐😂']
Who's watching this after watching Scoop?? / []
Here after the Scoop / []
Blink blink blink blink - it’s all a lie / []
Just watched SCOOP! Had to come back and watch the golden original! / []
What an utter tit! / ['well said']
Had to watch this after watching Scoop. Well done movie by Netflix. This guy is a pervert!  Glad he was exposed. / []
I believe he believes himself / []
Everyone running to watch the full interview after watching  scoop 😂 / []
Thr royal family are barbaric people andrew has the same brain as Ted bundy but is being counselled daily to suppress those feelings / []
Can we get a follow up about his relationship with convicted sex trafficker Ghilaine Maxwell? / []
Now get the rest of them ! Bill clinton and all the other perverts / []
anyone else come here from watching Scoop on Netflix? 👀 / []
all this stuttering and blinking. love seeing bullshit spewing / []
How embarrassing. Digging his own grave deeper and deeper with every word.....clueless,  desperate. He just doesn't get it...He CAN'T do such awful things and pretend it is okay. Tax payers paying for him to run all over the world behaving like a perv, because he is. / []
Dear Brits, I'm sorry to tell you but this family is weird  and sick!  Rapists, adulterers, traitors, greedy, scheming and what else? And you still cling to it?  Well, enjoy the scandals! / []
21:26 loll with the sweating he goes wrong big time, at first he states not being there,  but few seconds later he goes on and on about the sweating, , which tells us he was there, he dig his own hole there / []
I just watched scoop on netflix and now i'm here again. Watching this guy lie is.. it's so weird. / []
5 minutes in, I don't think I can watch this cringefest. / ['Did you make it through?', '@TenaciousSLG No, I did not lol']
I am appalled, that Prince Andrew could be so pompous, out of touch, ridiculous and shameful. Entitled old perv without a clue..... / []
Just let’s us all know how the aluminati have been abusing and raping our children for thousands of years and nothing will change they will just strive harder to keep it from public view keeping it hidden on their vast estates around the world! …..makes you think that religion was invented to stop the meek from uprising against their tyranny and schools are a way of brainwashing us all whilst they continue to rape and pillage us! / []
Please check in if you are watching this interview after watching the Netflix film Scoop. / ['Huhuuuu.', 'Oh no... I have been watching this gem since it first aired. I mean it is just a gift that keeps on giving xD', 'did his publicity team really think this was a good idea 🤣🤣 a blatant liar from start to finish', '@j3nnifert literally the first mistake they did was to give that man a voice 🤣🤣 his voice is literally just lies', 'omg i cannot believe how the movie and actors were so accurate 😂 i cannot even more believe he actually said those things lol']
No  , You wasn't worried about being seen round that park! And you would not have stayed !! / []
He knew what was going on because he was 100% involved!!!! / []
She just let him dog hours own Grace, genius.  Also… who let him go on with his tie all crooked. 🤣 / []
12:40 "...My tendency to be too honorable." / []
Tiny man, poor girls, sorry for them, liar, dirty and jajahh suffering from amnesia? How can he live with himself?? Stutter, stutter.. / []
complete failure🤪 / []
I watched this interview for the first time today. I had no idea it could be this insane / ['He is a sickening liar 😂😂', 'Same. Just watched now because of scoop on Netflix lol nuts', 'You and me both', 'Oh mate when this first came out the jokes people made were incredible, this comment section alone was brilliant', '@Lo2-q8ksame and i forgot how insane it was']
When is his version of O.J.'s "*If* I Did It" coming out / []
Who is watching this because of Scoop? / ['absolutely hilarious!😂😂']
This is like a 7 year old lying to his mum that he didn’t play with matches!! Absolutely hilarious! Why do they still exist? What a toxic bunch of in bred lying creeps…😂 / []
Every time he’s asked what he actually does he just jabbers on with total nonsense. What a useless piece of sh@t. And that’s not even anti royal. The others are 100 times better than this man. Waste of space / []
It was a convenient place to stay 😅 / []
He went to stay at Epstein's house to tell him the friendship was off... and then continued to stay in that house for several days and attend a party there. Epstein was also cool with having a recently fallen-out ex-friend just couch-surf around his place and party there. / []
A British Bill Clinton. / []
Body Language speaks a 1000 words and cuts to the truth of the matter. You only need watch to listen to the facts the body language speaks for itself. / []
Hands up if you're here because of Scoop on Netflix / ['🤚🤚', 'Yaaas Haha needed a refreshed memory😂👏🏼', 'I had to rewatch this again it’s just too good 😂', 'Absolutely 🎉', 'He is a pompous arrogant lying scumbag, like all the members of that parasite family, leaches and scroungers, return the stolen jewels to India!']
Who else watching again after watching Scoop (2024)? / []
Amazing job Ms. Maitlis.  Just watched Netflix movie.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 / []
Isn’t it ironic? People using guns to hurt people are punished while gun suppliers are spared, but people using sex service by sex slaves are spared while the suppliers are punished? / ["Guns are legally designed and manufactured to hurt people in choice circumstances by choice of the end user. People aren't supposed to be controlled and trafficked for sex."]
Randy Andy would be in jail if not for his bloodline. / []
Still an open comment thread. Where are the complainers and conspiracy theorists from 4 years ago who suggested their views would surely be censored?! I am proud of our BBC. Nothing is perfect but the BBC are the worlds most trusted news provider for a reason. / []
In America about half way through they'd be rolling out the lie detector with a close up on Andrew's face. / []
here after the film, scoop came out, its amazing how Emily lets him dig himself deeper, traps him almost, amazing interviewing! / ['She’s wonderful.']
If he went dancing at a nightclub,  and if it was with a 17 year old, it'd been all over the tabloids or news. / ["That isn't correct - young royals partying isn't news, and obsessive paps might know he's there but they can't literally trail people into the venue with their cameras."]
How would he know what upstairs at maxwells looked like if as he said he had never been upstairs? / []
Always believe the victims. / []
Who's here because they watched Scoop? / ['Me 🙋🏼\u200d♀️', 'Ich 😂', 'How\nMany people are going to ask this same question?']
What bothers me where was Andy's police bodyguards in all this. / ['Interesting--I never really thought about that. Good comment.', 'That is what I have always thought. Surely, wherever he went, he had lots of security so his whereabouts would have been documented. It must be known by the security people whether he was at the night club or at the pizza restaurant in Woking.', 'i mean he’s in buckingham palace so lots of security there anyway']
As a person educateded in basic human psychology, it took me about 10 seconds into his lies to see he was lying, so with my professional assumpsion, I'd say it would take the average person about 11 seconds to see the same thing. / []
He’s a liar about his friendship with Epstein but  there’s no evidence that he, himself, was involved with underage girls. The one woman who accused him was happy to accept a payoff. / ['I agree']
Royalty...privilege and unearned benefits, Billionaires play things. He doesn't get to qualify anything or reference the word leadership. Children were abuse and perhaps worse. He appear in pictures. / []
And a sicko! / []
He is such a snob! / []
His Teddy bears can vouch for him,all 54 of them,he was tucked up and sleeping that night in question, his Teddy bears never lie😂 / ['Do you think they attended the straight forward shooting weekend 😂']
MUM MA... PAY THEM OFF. / []
Pizza  express / []
there are groups of pakistani men in the north of England,  who have trafficked young girls ,   ages 11, or 12 ,  schoolgirls,    and then pimp them out to other asian men.    i have read about a few different cases ,   so why is everyone focussing on Andrew with a 17 year old ?   thats over the legal age of 16 / []
have i got this correct,   the alleged victim was 17 years old ?    age of consent in the UK is 16,    what exactly is illegal about 17 ? / ['Human trafficking', '17 is not illegal @24MissScarlet', 'If there was consent, do you think he (we) would have paid the money?', '@FRIMPZ0 no consent?   17 year old girls are that hard to get that they have to be forced ?  i dont think so ......   sounds like entrapment for the prince,   these girls know exactly what theyre doing...yes he paid,. because he didnt want the headache.  they are head of state,,  money is limitless to them', "@24MissScarlet what?  the prince couldnt meet a 17 year old,  unless she was captured and held as a prisoner?  come on,. he'd have a queue of teenagers wanting to date him .........for free.  when there is £££$$$ involved ,  have a close look at the 'victims'"]
What an absolute liar, it’s so cringe worthy watching him digging his own grave and really thinking that the world believe him, and then to shell out 12 million of his mothers money for something he swears never happened and to a person he swears he doesn’t even know, it’s so embarrassing and pathetic. / ["Don't forget where that money came from. The British public paid for that", '@niamhhegarty3133 the British public keep the monarchy where they are if we didn’t pay for them there wouldn’t be one', '@janlawson3402and how are we going to stop paying?', '@juicy.em_ we won’t ever stop paying for them unfortunately', '\u200b@juicy.em_  there are plenty of other countries which abolished this fckery.

Such a great reflection of the reasons why the UK royal family is secretive and opaque. The moment they open their mouth about their private life, dirty truth like this come out. A disgrace. / []
13 min in and I Can't 😅 the mutual agreement... the honouble thing to do... the leadership... 😂 / []
Jokes aside, it's even worse what he did considering he has 2 daughters. He's a father and he couldn't empathise with these girls or at least Virginia? I feel bad for his daughters, finding out what your dad really is. I also love how one of them came forward and said the Pizza Express event never happened. At least some members of the Royal family have a conscience and some honesty / []
"straight forward shooting weekend" 😂 / []
This guy gives power to the theory that MI5 murdered Epstein. How did he know or care about the bone in Epstein’s neck breaking or not? Pretty detailed, pretty grim talk. / []
He dated the porn star Koo Stark, how is that not partying? / []
This guy is a piece of work. / []
He acknowledges he is in the photo but he says he can’t remember it being taken and that that is his hand around her. / []
‘A photograph of a photograph of a photograph’. His lying of no recollection is an insult to victims everywhere. / []
Andrew later that day: "I started talking, and I had no clue how to stop" / ['😂']
Anybody with Prince Andrew on Windsor Leadership bingo card, think not. Not to mention how he lies throughout. / []
This interview is ageless / []
I believe him / ['you’re an idiot']
Boy, this guy almost lies as much as Trump. They are equally sleazy and slimy also. / []
that cat 🐈 is a fuckin liar and a crook / []
Too big to jail / []
Maitlis was used to rehabilitate Prince Andrew. To give him space to tell his side. Then she was let go by Aunty Beeb? Talk about being used? / []
cringe that he keeps saying "funnily enough" ...... there is literally NOTHING funny about any of it. Entitled idiot / []
He wanted to still be friends not in public view photos…. / ['And to have all the perks etc set up and waiting for his sorry A$$']
His girlfriend was just as bad or worse than there all three monsters… / []
Four years on and I'm still cringing at this... He should of never of done this interview, and kept his lies and secrets to himself.. I'm no detective but my god GUILT is an understatement. It's amazing how he can remember goin for PIZZA, but can't remember WHINING AND DINING, DANCING AND HAVING SEX with someone.. his nickname says it all RANDY ANDY and that's putting it lightly.. He should of been put in PRISON too, because if he thinks anybody who's watched this interview BELIEVES him he's in cloud cuckooland. Absolutely DISGUSTING AND DISGRACEFUL BEHAVIOUR  by anyone, but more so him being ROYALTY😡 / []
Child molester / []
21:45 says he did not sweat at that time due to a medical condition. Fifteen seconds later 22:02 says it was "almost" impossible for him to sweat. So, he could in fact sweat. Then, still without naming the so-called medical condition he says "there's a medical condition that says that I didn't do it" which sounds like a phrase from a 5 year old. / []
No one believes him. / []
He knew what to look for in terms of signs of abuse of children, but he simply did not see these underage girls as children. 😢 / []
Damn, I fancy a pizza... / []
They left the comments on😅 / ["this isnt Buckingham Palace's channel lol"]
It’s was over from the words shooting party / []
This man's stupidity is extraordinary. Even now, if you ask him about it, he will say that he doesn't know, doesn't remember, or is not aware! Remember that English taxpayers are paying his bills even now, four years later! / []
The only honest thing he probably said was never having purchased a drink. / ["Thing is, he wouldn't even need to go to the bar to order a drink. Rich people don't stand waiting at the bar like normal people. He could have quite easily bought the girl a drink with just a nod and a hand wave.", 'Hahaha!!!! Yes!!!! Total utter prick', 'If he ever been there. Just to be Clear.']
Arrogance, a lack of intellect and being unable to read a room can be a lethal combination……..A man probably with no true friends and now publicly finished.  Good riddance. / []
Ha ha what a joke / []
Prince Andrew cannot possibly sweat due to a medical condition..."It is only in recent past.... that I am starting to be able to do that again" Like right now during this interview as my forehead is starting to glisten. / []
Iiar liar 😂 what a creep needs locking up / []
Epstein probably did set up that picture getting taken in the park.... Diddy Combs is the new Jeffrey Epstein. Girls drugs... And pictures / []
Look Andrew was set up because that was the business of Maxwell and Epstein. Hence all their video footage. They got money out of rich men by blackmail. And you may depend both of those two would have hidden their practises from Andrew. Tha case is not about his friendship its about Andrew forcing sex on a minor. I think Andrew is being candid and he was honourable. The way the BBC nagged him into an interview by coercion and gentle persuasion just to nail him. You can tell that interviewer believed he was guilty before the interview  i am convinced Andrew did not rape Virginia. She knew perfectly well what she was doing  Why do you plebs get such pleasure in levelling or trying to level the aristocracy. I think this is grossly unfair because it was the producer from the BBC who kept sending emails nagging him to do the interview with the sole intention of humiliating him. When will aristocrats stick to their own people because they need to. This guy is refreshingly naive and honest and this woman is extremely presumptious and rude and very artful / []
You can tell he is lying as soon as his lips start moving you can just tell lol never seen so much stuttering and bullshit in my life 🙄🥱🥱 Epstein Andrew it was assisted Suicide not suicide get it right 🤫 the plum should of just not done the interview and just let rumours circle he is guilty as hell mun what a clown of a man I don’t sweat 😅 / []
7:15 7:15 😅 / []
He thought he ate that / []
Who is this Prince Alan Partridge? / []
This guy must end up in jail! / []
"nagging at my mind" / []

The never ending train wreck / []
Trying to watch this before Scoop on Netflix - never seen it before, only heard about it - and I’m not sure I can get through it… I keep having to pause it, it’s affecting me so much. The absence of any humility and the ignorance of this man! Excruciating. Nauseating. Disturbing. Rage inducing. Repulsive. Hideous. / []
He's making this up as he goes along, his conversation is not fluent whatsoever with subtle breakages, tone differences and his body language is all over the place which means he's thinking the lies, you don't think the truth, it flows from your subconscious. He's a blatant liar and this is so obvious to see, he also comes across as a bit dim, you'd think someone like him with access to the best education he'd be a lot smarter but I can confidently say my mind is far sharper than his and I'm a Geordie council lad. / []
If he's never been upstairs in that house, as he said, then how does he know the photo was taken upstairs? He wouldn't know what the upstairs look like in that house, if he's never been upstairs in that house. Yet, he insists the photo was taken upstairs. Has he some sort of super vision? / ['Super something']
This “distinguished”, “respectable”, “charming” man exemplifies the stupidity in placing any human - including so-called “royals” - on a pedestal.  There is only One True Royal.  One True King, Jesus Christ.  The so-called “royals” that walk the Earth are just mere mortals who have been conditioned to believe they are something great. *Clearly* they are not. / []
😂😂 what’s a self entitled knob!! I’ve met him on many occasions, and that is still my view… / []
I don’t 🕺🏾 dance, I don’t have any legs 🦵 nor feet 🦶 to do any dancing 😂😂😂 / []
This was extremely cringey. It was very difficult to watch.  Yet I’m watching 😂 / []
Andrew was arrogant but ask yourself why only Andrew took the fall Maxwell went was invited to Chelsea Clintons wedding in 2010 knowing Epstein was convicted in 2008 so why isnt Bill Clinton cruocifed he went to his island several times but hes not looked into like andrew . I think the 🇺🇲needed a high ranking person to be the fall guy & Andrew was arrogant & perfect for the patsy for all the powerful men on that flight log & island guest book / []
Hes a buffoon who didn't bother to even prep for this unbelievable!! / []
NAILED IT #TEAMPRINCEANDREW / ['🤣🤣🤣']
I’m looking forward to watching “Scoop” on Friday on Netflix. / ["go watch it!! it's very accurate tho"]
Netflix Scoop is why I’m here / []
Rats  Andrew u plonker  Andrew  u killed your  mother  with all the stress  u put her  through and she still  gave millions of pounds  to keep  things quiet  tax money  how things  are  different for the rich buy your way out sick in these hard times / []
There is absolutely no way you had no knowledge of his freaky behavior. No matter what you say, you’re guilty of being an accomplice to what he was doing. You’re lying and we all know you’re lying. Just tell the truth. The truth always comes out! / []
20:51 nearly choked from sudden burst of laughter there. and sweating bit later. this interview sounds like 'this is spinal tap' type of interview / ["I'm watching again tonight after seeing Scoop and I'm listening while reading the comments, and thought the same exact thing!"]
So he pays £12 milion to someone he has "never met"? Disgusting peado🤢🤮 / []
“…a foot may—sage’…” / []
She said how did you meet eipstein   He said well through his girlfriend 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 / []
He is truly a peice of shit!! Please don't let this one come to USA!! / []
Just like selfish stupid Great Uncle ex King Edward -  Doesn’t regret being friends with HITLER because it’s all about THEMSELVES and what these people can do for them. So they can be friends with EVIL PEOPLE as long as they themselves get something out of it. Yeah .. definitely the definition of HONORABLE / []
I have a simple question to ask Virginia why didn’t she report it immediately when she was forced to do this the first time ? Why after three times she decided to report this. Am I missing something here? / ["ahh the good old victim blaming.... it's like you've never heard about the sickening manipulation and threatening tactics of the predators to silence their victims.", '@renab.9202 she doesn’t look a victim in the pic with him. She has a big smile on her face. I am not judging her I am just curious if there is more to the story ? Cause the victim is not silent in this story.']
Funny how the BBC gets this "EXCLUSIVE" "SCOOP" on a suspected pedoVILE wen there's been meny who suspect certain individuals whithin the BBC are in actual fact pedoVILES emselves! Hmmm...😐 / []
The Prince of "Fans of the playground", I bet he pulled strings to be the "Patron of the NSPCC full stop campaign" to have control over any evidence against him! HMmmm, Epstein and Prince P3do walking in a public park, nah that's never gonna get pics taken! (Tui Add) / []
Fairs to him, this interview was probably the best thing he’s done in his life! / []
I'm from the future, there will be a Netflix show made about the size of the grave he dug during this interview. / []
That's the reason a lot of countries in this world do not do not want the lie detector test because they got and hitting agenda me personally every powerful people in day country should take the lie detector test and ask them they did they ever touched a baby if you are innocent there's no reason to run from this you should support it but is okay because I've been saying for a long time God's best creations given to man is women and children nobody could run from death and good is waiting for you good never lose always win me personally I got no compassion for evil this is me have a good day thank you 🌎👈🤔 / []
The only thing that I am going to say if you do got kids keep a close eye on them specially if you got a daughter trust nobody they are praying on your kids do not trust the book by the cover please they are here thank you to be aware is to be alive 💯👈🤔 / []
Soundtrack to forthcoming movie? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zRirgarrwA / []
First time I have seen all of this interview. The only big take away is how his "people" allowed him to sit there with his tie askew! / []
13:48. Emily says the author John Brockman was there and Pr Andrew replies ‘really’.  She then says he saw Andrew having a foot massage.  Andrew then says that it hadn’t happened.  Emily states  ‘is Brockman lying?’ Andrew ‘I’ve never met him.’  So why say ‘really’ and look so surprised at him being there? / []
He's guilty💩 💯👈🤔 / []
PEDOPHILE / []
This interview makes me so sad. He's obviously nervous throughout, so why do it??? Was it live??? Because why couldn't he just call it off??? / []
What? He couldn’t have conveyed to Ghisllaine Maxwell to convey to Epstein that it was no longer possible to be seen with Epstein? He had to STAY at his house to convey that? / []
I don't get the flack, what's he actually done wrong??? 😮 Let him without sin cast the first stone!!! / []
What a disgrace to the legacy of the late her majesty the queen, who worked tirelessly on behalf of the British people, only to live to see her selfish and stupid children muck it up.   Disgusting. / []
I had to go and visit Epstein’s and have one last roll in the sheets . / []
Whenever I'm in a pickle like this, I sit on my balls with all my weight and pass out. / ['🤣🤣🤣']
Where do i put my paw print to this confession? / []
😂 he has a very high opinion of himself.. very privileged and a bit dim.. but he'll come out smelling of roses no matter what he's done. Like the rest of the awful people that are privileged and protected and think they're clever.. listen to my man Bob Marley ❤❤❤ / []
Psychopath / []
That pesky tendency to be too honorable . LOL.... the nerve to try that one / []
He's more handsome now / []
Poor honourable man, he didn’t have any means to get B&B , so he stayed in caravan-saray( caravan- palace) instead! / []
It is like affirmative action for royals   He was over-promoted to "Ponce Andrew" in early life then never held to account, so he always thought he could intimidate people and trick them. / ['There is a great video interview with a security guard on Andrew\'s detail for several years \nSearch "Royal Security Officer On Life Inside The Royal Family"   He has the scoop on what an utter See you Andrew is, and how dumb he thinks people are around him, when he is the dumb one']
He must have shares in driclor >.< / []
Because I'm a man.... positive action..?!! Whaat??! / []
Brilliant / []
What an embarrassment Andrew is. / []
LOL The worst liar I’ve ever seen. After this interview came out, other facts came out. If you were not guilty, would you pay millions in hush money to someone that you’d never met? He really thinks the public zips up at the back of the neck. 😂😂😂😂 / []
Justa gronk... / []
Drop this idiot in the  Atlantic😂😂 / []
He doesn't touch women like that in photos. He doesn't sweat. He doesn't dress like that when he's out.  Next day: hundred of photos, taken around that time, showing he's lying his ass off. 😂😂😂 / []
"I'M TETOTAL  I REMEMBER EVERYTHING, SHE LYING SHE'S LYING SHE'S LYING" - Not Prince Andrew.   😂😂😂 / []
Is it a fair comment to say that this bloke is just totally "thick"? / []
This interview was a disaster. I don’t think Andrew ever got the “Never Complain, Never Explain” memo. 😒 / []
'How do you reconnect with people' - that was a sick question / []
Duchess is away for her daughter’s birthday? / []
As his PR: hey man…stfu. / []
« Well it was a convinient place to stay » 😅 / []
academics and politicians you say? please name some names / []
in a just world he and his ilk would be in jail for the rest of their lives / []
"I have no recollection of recollecting the recollect that the pahhhhhty I attended to that I didn't go to wish to believe that I'm a piece of shit" / []
Epic / []
How much can you hit prince Andrew for? / []
Andrew is innocent lol 😂 he took a selfie 😂 / []
No justice at its best / []
"I don't have a message for her" oh btw here is 12 million / []
Prince ped0. Certainly not the first in thei royal family circle and not last .   Its been to referred to for years. / []
His go to “Funny enough…” not so funny you idiot. Girls were trafficked, lives destroyed so you could get your perverted jollies. Turns out you ARE guilty and PAID a tidy sum for your perverted jollies. How you SHAMED your own Mother, her RH the Queen. You and your stupid Fergie literally killed the Royal Family. I hope your daughters never EVER meet someone like you. But maybe you tapped them already. PIG. / []
14:06 best scene EVER, this is how you should NOT look like when lying / []
The UK is such a push over / ['For real!  Can’t believe they suck up to these low intelligence fools']
The way he said no was an unbelievably obvious lie. His facial expression’s, his lack of remorse. His lack of defense as an innocent person would. He acts like a confused child / []
they made a film about this interview now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZcHc3zEEoc&ab_channel=Netflix / []
Disgusting clown / []
Clown / []
Nothing worse than a dumb mfer that thinks hes smarter than everyone else... he really thinks hes fooling ppl... stuttering fuck / ['I don’t understand how people can put this mediocre family of imbeciles on a pedestal, honestly.\n\nIt’s mind boggling.']
“You were invited to a dinner?”  “Well there was a dinner and I went. But certainly not how you’ve put it”  😂😂😂 / ['Okay I’m not defending him here he definitely did some shady and illegal things. But when it comes to this quote, this is a misunderstanding, when he said “not how you’ve put it” he’s referring to her referring to it as a house party moments before', '“You were the guest of honor” \n\n😂']
Unbecoming / []
Like Oj Simpson. He did a interview say " hypothetically if i did it." / []
"Unbecoming? ... he was a sex offender!   OMG!! 😮😮 / ["You know, I wonder why he just could not bring himself to denounce any of this reprehensible behavior or call it as it is, disgusting. Was it that he simply does not see it that way (disturbing thought all by itself), or he was worried who of his buddies that know the whole truth would think? Epstien wasn't the only one who knew. I think it's both. This guy isn't just stupid, he's mentally off."]
Born liar scum / []
Wow. The epitome of cluelessness who on earth would believe his drivel? / ['Brits.  They’re brainwashed into worshipping this mediocre family of dimwits']
I don’t understand why everyone says this interview was a disaster - I think it seems like he did pretty well. / ['😂😂😂 Your sarcasm is spot on.']
Virginia Roberts is a liar. / []
@BBC News how far with this guy? Surely andrew tate can wait / []
Wow. / []
A short news day so the Express does Royal family again,   make it all upas you usually do. / []
Just like the CEO of a big company who can't believe that anybody can see through them...just how gullible does he think his 'subjects' are. How did his PR people ever let this happen...? LOLZ!!!! / ['They’re all brainwashed.  Into worshipping this utterly DIM family of underachievers']
The ultimate narcissist. I was too honourable 😅 / []
The last 2 minutes he channels Stewie Griffin. / []
How on God's green earth did he think this was a good idea? / []
43:23 This explanation of what it is that he is doing is just crazy! Craaaay Zeeee. Poor Queen Elizabeth. / []
36:52 Ohhhh, Andrew. Whew. / []
"The photograph was taken upstairs" (so he's obviously been upstairs)" I don't think I ever went upstairs." .... Excruciating....slow destruction, his shtty, little, podgy, lying schoolboy face. / []
If he says, "you have to remembah..." one more time... / []
Not even 4 mins in & the cringe! I can't watch! It's just too painfully uncomfortable. Yikes, Andrew... / []
The fact that he used.his children for an excuse is evil.  What a douc**. There's a slight problem with sweating.   I can't sweat " Unbelievable. This was a slow mo train wreck! Narracicist much? / []
That look on her face when he says thank you at the end is remarkable. / []
First time watching this- This is so cringe i can't.. i really can't. Lol / []
The only person to benefit from this interview was Emily Maitlis... similar to Theroux and Savile really. No justice, just a BBC reporter becoming more famous thanks to a sex offender / []
If he’s never been upstairs at Guilane’s house how does he know it was upstairs??? I love how he chokes talking about speaking with the FBI 😂 / []
Bullshit bullshit / []
You're a pedophile you are a f****** lying piece of s*** that should go to jail wake up world and send this piece of s*** to jail where he belongs but I'll give you 20 million dollars to keep your mouth shut okay then what a bunch of sheep the world have come to / []
Wow..what an interview..what a creep / []
Came here after watching Peacock’s documentary on him “Banished”. And right before Netflix’s “Scoop”. Can’t wait!! / []
If you don’t wanna be a chicken, you fell repugnant excuse for human being, Let somebody give you a lie detector test . Let’s say the prosecution for the victims could set it up if you really wanted to prove your innocence As every word that comes out of your mouth is a lie. NG💩 / []
23:39 difficult to prove the photo is faked or not? If he is saying he wasn’t upstairs and he didn’t put his arm around that woman then THE PHOTO IS ABSOLUTELY FAKE 100% fake but he doesn’t say that he says faked or not faked. This is why the Queen paid out $20m for it all to go away for him. 🤨 / []
He stopped being friends with a known sex offender but only for a few yrs 😂 / []
I feel like for the last 5 years we’ve been watching the Royal Family fall apart in real time / []
Andrew was hoping there would be no evidence on him or any type of black mailing issue So he’s going to deny deny  But he lied / []
Prince Andrew has been exposed....He's a dirty prince. / []
Okay 🙄First time i have watched this 🙄Firstly, He is not overly intelligent • Secondly , there are literally dozens of Red Flags in this interview • The constant change of recollection • The consistent use of the words "Definitely not " the glances to the left , the almost continuous frowning, shocked expression • He would last less than an hour in a Court of law • This was a TRAINWRECK at best , and whomever advised him to do this interview, need to question their judgment • What a grub he is • / []
Andy is having Candy and abit of Randy with Mandy! / []
I ordered a Kids Pizza in Wokingham! 😂 / []
Beatrice: “So Daddy, how did it go?” Andrew: “Splendid. I told you it would be alright. You should listen to me in future.” / ['poor beatrice']
god after all these years this is still priceless / []
“Funny enough , yes I don’t remember that at tall “ I don’t believe I’m going to admit to shit I’m too honorable you see… oddly enough! 😅 this is wild someone can lie like this. / []
WHEN ARE YOU PAYING YOUR BILLS AND REPLACING THE STOLEN VEHICLE?  IT'S BEEN A FEW DAYS NOW.... / []
Car crash. / []
This is good entertainment / []
its not just andrew the whole royal family are pedophiles guys please look into it its everybody in the elite ruling class we are fighting a war against pedophiles that want full control of our world and our souls, research Adrenochrome!!! as if it was just research. miss me with that bullshit hollywood is evil / []
He is'  becoming "  guilty / []
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave..." 😓😵‍💫🤤 / []
It's quite clear , this wonderful prince is innocent and white as snow, morally speaking. 😇😇 / []
He looks so bad..."Tendency to be to honourable....but that is just the way it is" / []
Liar why doesn’t anyone do anything?’😢 / []
Guy with unlimited money and servants: I had to crash at this paedo’s place cos it was convenient / ['Also “people act differently around me bc I’m royal” then “I’m just like everybody else!”']
He should pay h&m for their services, MAYBE he does already! The drama that harry and markle are causing is clearly distracting from andrew and his friendship with epstein. Is it true that markle used to be a yacht girl? She might have met andrew even before she met harry right? She was friends with eugene or at least with some of her friends. INTERESTING / ["And the fact that h&m sat down with oprah speaks volumes. Wasn't she on epstein Island too? \nCall me crazy but i do believe that andrew and markle are using harry"]
Prince Andrew and Jeffery Epstein 💘 Birds of a feather flock together. Plain and simple. / []
creepy smile @28:07 / []
Seriously?!??? 😮 / []
https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?si=3qOv9mqqbCFFXC9L / []
What a Buffoon ! / []
unbelievably embarrassing and so so guilty. He should be stripped of his title and jailed. pedophile. / []
Do the royals not realise that the posh flustered speech pattern does not make you sound eloquent and innocent? It's quite the opposite, arrogant and ignorant. / []
Duuuude, why can't she make him explain when he says how BENEFICIAL his relationship with epstein. Hes defending it quite a bit now. / []
37:08 😮😮😮😮 Wow.... hes the one who needs closure?? As much as the trafficked women. / []
The whole way he articulates himself is like a child or preteen. He thought he was never gonna have to speak since he isnt Charles or William.. or Harry.   This fool really said "i do not sweat.. i did not sweat back then. I lost the ability after i was shot at." 😂😂 / ['Mind blowing isn’t it?!\n\nEmily NAILED this clown!  To the WALL.\n\nThis dude hung himself with ALL the rope Maitlis was dropping!']
It took him 6 months to prepare and it went so poorly!! 😂 / []
i counted 1579 stutters / ['I counted about that many blinks..😂']
This is unreal …felt like I was watching an SNL skit 😂 / []
Not a young woman  - she's a CHILD OR A MINOR.  They were CHILDREN.  But anything else was great from the interviewer. / ['There were victims of many ages, however you are correct in pointing out that many were minors involved.']
Still the most embarrassing thing on Television ever. The Royals are an embarrassment. / ['It really has been shocking...repulsive scandals...', 'And this one was Mummy’s favorite.  The Queen thought this loser was the best of the bunch!\n\nWhat a ringing endorsement.\n\nThis is a family of room temp IQ idiots.']
He did not listen very well to the coaching team before the interview began, but remembered their advice at all the inappropriate moments.  Take some still photos of Randy Andy's  facial expressions when cornered for an explanation. Epic! Thankfully  his reputation is in tatters and he will be stored, forevermore, in the royal attic. / []
Must rename as:   *The number 1 most hilarious interview of all time.*  😁 / ["It's sickening knowing  this guy is free and enjoy taxpayer's money to live a millionaires life", '@razworthers_3601 It certainly is!', '@DrAlexisM\xa0 thus interview is hilarious tho 🤣 the guy sounds so guilty']
am i watching a bad comedy skit right now? / ['SNL couldn’t even write this!']
Doesn’t make sense really. Who his mother is and family? Why would he intentionally mix himself up in that knowing the consequences? Peadophiles don’t have shit lying round their homes. His island wouldn’t have had naked kids running round! Would have been a place for business. Not sticking up for Andrew but sounds like they liked having him as a friend for status and used his obvious gullible nature to take advantage of that. Anyway why is Andrew singled out. Fuck tonne of American “elites” were closer than that but they all pinned the Brit! / ['True', 'Because the girl who singled him out was smart!  She got £12MM for “never meeting” this clown.  SMH']
How  embarrassing when you screw an underage girl…. Clearly a  Pedophile. What makes it so much better is that he is in the public eye! / []
Clearly, guilty as hell! When you say you can’t remember you are  hiding something. / ["Unless you just don't remember ?"]
After All That Randy Andy Has Stated Here, I WONDER Why He Paid Virgina 12.5 Million POUNDS Sterling ? / ['Same!']
This ROYAL Man is a ROYAL LIAR and The Man LIES Through His LOUSY Teeth Too 😁 / []
This Man AND All of Those Indulgent OLD Pedophiles are GUILTY of MURDER ...." Different Strokes for Different Folks  - So Much For the " Rule of LAW " in The USA 🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
He does not appear delighted / []
What happened happened !The story will die a natural death and he will have to live with the stigma ! / []
Genuinely one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. / []
I didnt sweat at the time, its like a comedy sketch 🤣😂 / []
Honourable 🤣😂🤣😂 / []
He's still completely comfortable claiming Ghaslaine Maxwell as a friend. . . / []
Andrew ... LIAR!! / []
Sorry you can see he is telling lots of lies!! / []
He had plenty of time to be in tramps they didnt open till about 10 pm as he would be well aware of / []
What gets me is no one has pointed out how many times he nodded yes when saying he never slept with her. Wild, no one can hide their micro expressions / ['Or when he was talking about being a happily married man he was actually nodding no over and over again 😂', 'Hmmm....he says "I can absolutely categorically it never happened" at 27:50, all while shaking his head up and down in a yes. Micro-exspressions say it all.', '@tinatrent681 oh my….i missed that one.', 'have u been watching JCS videos ?', "Or when asked if he'll give a statement to the police to help their investigation:\n\n(Head) shake shake shake.\n(Words) ...let me ask my lawyers."]
do you KNOW you DIDNT meet her ....HAHAHAHA,, / []
Einfach nur armselig dieser Mann. Mir ist einfach nur übel, bei so viel arroganter scheinhiligkeit. / []
Shit man. / []
How didn't he anticipate his friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, would be arrested, tried, convicted, and jailed for sex trafficking? / []
If he knows that he never had sex or better said raped her - then why is he so hesitant in calling her a liar.  How bad of a a liar can you be ?! / []
How thoughtful of Epstein to hide all the underage girls when Prince Andrew was in town . / []
Time exposed scandal on the island / []
Time throw him out now / []
Imagine if Tucker Carlson had the balls to interview Putin like this / ['Imagine if you are not as gullible to believe what cross dressing leader of Ukraine says \nWith his Ss nazi loving regiments']
I was doing a number of different things while watching this interview / []
He didn’t want to be seen with him anymore, but he took a walk in the park with him…in New York City….to tell him. In broad daylight. / ['Lmao', 'And then went back to his house to stay for another few days? What??', 'So not “you are a SO, I have nothing to say to you, how could you etc” but \ngive the sit, it’s not convenient to be SEEN in you company', "Yes, he took a trip to be seen together with Epstein to tell him they couldn't be seen together. Got it.", 'Possibly, the most ridiculous comment he made.']
At the end of the day, he's been stripped of his titles, not allowed  to attend any Royal family public functions, lost any jobs or associations he had with the various organisations he represented and worked for. And he'll never been trusted again. I wonder how he feels now after incriminating himself on television. He might have been better off being sent to prison. In any case, hes gor what he deserved. To be branded an outcast. / ['He knows nothing about Honour', "Well not really. He's still referred to as Prince Andrew and gets invited to the same state occasions as his brother and sister."]
12:36 - "My judgement was colored by my tendency to be....too honorable"  (Spending 3 days in Epstein's house, in order to end their friendship) -  Brilliant! / ['That sounds like the job interview response “my weakness is that I’m too much of a perfectionist!” 🤣']
"Cant Get No...Positive Action!!" / []
The Royal Hamster / []
Idk if I should give it a like or dislike bcs it's confusing! It's a good interview bcs he's digging his own grave are we giving a like to BBC or to him? / []
WH LET THE TURMPS INTO AMERICA? WHO LET DONALD ONTO THE INTERNET? / []
Amazing he pays £12m plus to someone he’s never met / ['His mum paid that, not him...', "Let's all start making 'accusations' against him, we might get 12M! 🙏\n\nYou don't just pay randomers that much money who's got absolutely nothing on you! 🙄", '@egrif9303 no. they are head of state and have access to unlimited money', 'As the song goes \n\nOh the grand of Duke of York\nHe had 12 million quid\nHe paid someone he never knew\nFor something he never did!', '😂😂👏🏽👌🏽best response I’ve seen to date regarding him & his recollections']
He says Epstein’s house was like a railway station people in and out all the time , so as a member of the Royal family who was vetting the place for his security? / ['Bunch of strapped dope dealers with grande party favours', 'Great question!']
😂 so he had to go  and see him to tell him they can’t be seen together anymore or remain in contact with this person who is a friend of a friend 😂😂😂 / []
this whole episode is so strange... I mean in adult world and their private lives, are their lives... nothing beyond that... yet they have their own certain dignity and public image and that can get hit by sordidness of such episodes, which nobody knows what the truth is. his candor in admitting his mistakes just to be seen in vicinity of that notorious person Epstein is refreshing...so why would such personas go for sordidness  really a muddled affair... / []
Ne želim biti neugodns ali bi te molila da me ne maktretiraš .nisi moj tip u itali imaš đwna lijepih ,u engleskoj njemačkoj molim te da me ne msltretirasa svijim sex niau moj tip / ['Nek si mu rekla 😂']
i dont get it at all,why all the hate for this humble man,hes such a gentleman and so brave it took him 3 days to say goodbye to a  p of file / []
I love the recent comments. Glad people haven’t forgotten about this over privileged, arrogant, perverted and narcissistic man. / []
someone who wasnt trying to lie wouldn't be using hand gestures and moving his head and body.. they would be still.. / []
If an ordinary person did this they would be serving 25 years in prison, its disgusting that hes gotten away with this with no charges absolutely disgusting! / ['And used the British taxpayers money to pay off the woman he’s never met', 'I agree. By law you can still pay people off rather than be convicted', 'That’s the House of Windsor for you!!!!', "\u200b@holliemcnishNo you can't. No such law exists. It was a civil trial, not a criminal one. You can't buy your way out of a criminal trial."]
This is the best interview in the world’s history! / []
This slime is a terrible Liar! Disgusting pig / []
😅peedp / []
LIAR / []
Why is he not being prosecuted? What a POS / []
Looking back on this, Emily Maitlis did such a great job with this interview. Direct questions with no interruption and just letting Prince Andrew dig his own grave. / ["I've come back to it - with no small amount of discomfort - because it is such a slow burner.... I knew nothing about the backstory before this interview and so watching it get worse and worse...and worse....is totally excruciating!", 'Without arguing or any emotion… very good interviewing!']
He can’t help itself in the sense he is incredibly dumb, stupid. He has ruined his position, his reputation and he deserves all the ridicule and criticism. The Queen did the right thing by putting him in complete isolation. / []
Maybe if anyone from the Institutions  would answer another question in order to figure  out what is going on :      "Who is that one minor age kid born during 1960íes  that is   at the same time  also    the   "Non Voluntary"   biological  DNA  Parent TO SPANISH POLITICIAN  PEDRO  SANCHEZ "    &  how  is  that linkeD  TO   TRUMP  Family   & LinkeD  TO   british  Crown  and as well at the same time also linkeD  TO  Danmark´s  CROWN  ?      And  while   in reality  King Frederik  X  could be the GrandChild  of the Crown Parent,  and not at all the Child.    And who is the biological  DNA parent of the blond blue eyed Princess  Isabela  of Danmark ?  And who is the biological   blond blue eyed  DNA  parent of Crownprincess  of Spain ?  While  also  havin gin mind that Rotschild  himself is the same DNA  family  to   Ingolf  (Count of Danmark),  while the bloodLink  from there goes to  Danmark´s politician  Alex Ahrendtsen , while  the bloodLine from there goes  to   top politician  Allessandro  Vucic,  and from there Allessandro  Vucic´s  Wife  Tamara Vucic is a direct DNA  bloodLink (or impersonatos)   of  french  gypsy montengrin Princess Marie  married to  Danark´s  Prince Joachim  (while that one case is linkeD to also Emanuela  Orlandi in Vatican)...  Full circle  ?   Who is the Father of "many Nations"?  "Piazza"  is the OPEN MARKET  in   maybe in Italy where they sell fruits and vegetables...  In slavic  language  :   "pijaca".   It ended up by being named : PiazzaGate ? / []
Reading all these comments and cackling. I love you all. / []
What a vile snake of an entitled lowlife 🤮🤮 / []
Channel 4 wants adults to strip naked in front of children BBC News grills child rapists  I'm not saying they're perfect, but BBCs got my support / []
I have a feeling that if King Charles does not beat his recent cancer diagnosis, and I pray he does, that Prince William will not hesitate as King to kick Prince Andrew to the curb. / []
The comments here are almost as good as the interview / []
I love the way every time a question is asked about the royal family straight away he’s like no no it was my decision it was nothing to do with them. Too late bucko you’ve already black listed and tarnished their name / []
How extraordinary / []
Academics, Stephen hawking. Damnnn / []
This is not my first time watching this car crash and every time I still LOL!!!😂 / ['I do not no why but I watch this train wreck alot...lol', 'It’s just so so funny', '@FloR-mj5qj Stunning stupidity']
I have no sympathy for Virginia Guffre or the other girls. They chose to do that and were happy getting money and gifts thrown at them all the time and staying on an amazing 5* island. It was only until they got fatter older and uglier they started to complain looking for even more money. They should have walked and reported it to the police when it first happened yet they chose to continue. A huge smile in every pic taken. So sorry for me they are just money grabbing tramps / ['Even if that’s true it doesn’t change the fact that allot of old men abused their money and power to have sex with allot of underage girls despite the fact it was illegal and got away with it because of said money and power.', '@tomspyro5795 I fully agree with that', 'Craig you don’t know how grooming works', '@dontatme289 oh I know how grooming works . That doesn’t explain how these women kept doing it even when older']
He laughs and smirk every time she mentions Epstein is dead 🤔 / []
"I went to tell him we couldn't be SEEN together". Really? Not "we COULDN'T together or HANG together" but SEEN?!? LOL he's definitely lying 😂 / []
It’s difficult to forget positive action? What the fuck lol / []
Even the Royal Family can escape Darwin / []

good grief..I just took an on line Course on how not to incriminate yourself 101 / []
Feicing liar / []
I was ok with his explanation until at 11:17 he said “it was a convenient place to stay (at Epstein’s)”. Bullshit. Aren’t you royal? I’m sure you have a hundred luxury options to choose from. Liar. / []
It takes a complete sociopath to think you can pull the wool over the entire world / []

My wife just called me out for banging her best friend. I told her it couldn’t be me because I was at Pizza Express in Woking that night…. Didn’t work. / ['lol', "HAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAAHAHH \n\nPerhaps you should've said 'It was just a shooting weekend.'"]
Come on guys! Leave Prince Andrew alone! All he wants to do is settle down and have kids! 😂  I'll let myself out... / []
Gosh, such a brilliant, original defense! "I have no recollection." / []
He loves to use as many words as possible,to avoid getting to the point. / []
Liar liar pants on fire!! / []
4 years ago and this is still one of the most cringeworthy interviews. She did an amazing job. She literally just handed him a shovel and let him dig. / ['i missed that part -- can you share the timecode?', 'No, not really.', 'I think he was open and seemed transparent he volunteered to do this thing.', "\u200b@wiredcer  she just asked simple questions why,repeatedly- none of his answers justified the seriousness of what he did - including meeting Epsten after he was convicted, she just pointed out known facts .Andrew just thought he will brush these as no biggie - no big deal - he didn't realise its shocking he invited sex offender to hus daughter 18th/meeting in person etc. Plus how he talked about victim that was the biggest getaway", '@juliabewsher3277 i was making a joke']
A complete idiot all his life...reprehensible for a man with his status / []
I feel bad for him. He has sweat problems, memory problems, and some kind of body language disorder that makes him seem untruthful. Give the man a break - his life has been hard enough. / ['🤣']
how long was that walk in the park? / []
he avoids direct answers just like the mcanns do. / []
Well, you gotta feel bad for the Queen. I mean, she got her status by being this human-invented title reigning over a human-invented country, but she died very much a real human being with the knowledge that her real son certainly did not have any recollection of his sexual dealings with real underage girls, as a globally known fact / []
The more I watch it, the more I wanna see him in court. He needs to pay just like anyone else would. / ["The problem is that he would never get a jury that didn't know him and this interview. \nIt's insane.", '@kp8381 and he paid one of his complainants 10, million quid to keep her mouth shut.']
“ I went to stay with him (Epstein) at his mansion to tell him that it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to be seen with him anymore.” 😂 this bloke is a dimwit. / []
I struggle to endure the whole interview because of his stammering / []
OMG he sounds like Porky Pig 🐷 stuttering like crazy …. Ssssorry, Dddddont recall jajaja 🤣 so dam guilty. / []
It's been well documented over the years about people lying in statements and in court and one photo doesn't prove anything but as usual guilty by association and must be guilty because it's a man . / []
She's a master class in how to interview, and he's a master class on the exactly wrong way of defending yourself just short of admitting fault. / []
Some of the questions are really stupid why the hell would epstien make it blatantly obvious he was SA young girls right in front of the prince and other people, he's hardly likely to be having sex infront of the people he invited to his homes.  Just really poor journalism and ridiculous questions. / []
26:50 homeboy knew that the photograph was upstairs but never went up there lmao. How did he know what was there lol / ['"At the time I had a medical condition which enabled me to see through walls"', 'He slipped up and admitted he has in fact 1) gone upstairs 2) that he knew the photograph was taken and remembers it being taken and 3) remembers meeting virignia and he did in fact hold her/hug her which means he is probably lying about not being with her', '@wiredcer😹😹😹']
Secondhand embarrassment watching this again 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
If he was NEVER upstairs in that house !!!!......how did he know that the photo was taken upstairs???? / ["The banister. They are pictured next to the banister. In UK homes the upstairs has a banister and it's opposite the bedrooms. He wants you to know he was never upstairs where the BEDROOMS are as bedrooms = s*x", 'because he read it in the papers', 'Tbf you can very clearly see in the picture that it was taken next to a set of stairs', '@J3ennife4 ive got stairs.  am i guilty also ?  come on, she was 17 ,  over the age of 16', '@J3ennife4 could be cellar stairs']

I can already hear Gillian Anderson nail this!!! 💯 / []
Fix your necktie / []
31:53 Somebody decode this for me pls / ['I don\'t know how youtube censorship works so funtime is my stand in; He\'s saying you as a person need to do things that are good and desirable for you, and they are things you can\'t forget easily. Funtime is one of those good things, so would be really difficult to forget, and because he doesn\'t remember this specific funtime happening, he\'s saying it didn\'t happen. Essentially he\'s saying "I couldn\'t have had funtime, because I would have remembered it"']
I’m going to say something totally crazy,  This may shock you but….  I think he’s lying / ['😂😂😂😂😂. Good one']
He's absolutely disgusting 😤 / []
Absolutely no indication but if there was... But i never saw them. / []
the pomposity of this man is astonishing / []
I am sick about Royal Family protection him all his life and their fake public image. It is horrific what else they are hiding. / []
“Those are my travelling clothes.” Innocence proven right there. / []
i think the girl wanted some money. he provided facts the woman didnt. / []
He laughs when he mentions that Epstein is dead and whether or not it was suicide. He’s laughing in our face. / []
Not a body language expert but I noticed a slight smile at the ‘tendency to be too honorable’ remark. / []
Has some serious selective memory. / []
Too late,so sad,bye bye / []
Oh wo,had too much to drink but remember it,now pretending it did not happen / ['We return now to our live on-scene reporter tarjakangas6681: how are things unfolding on your end?', '@stevenr.rodriguez9997I didn’t understand this comment till I scrolled and saw them documenting every reaction 😭']
Again a lie / []
How do you know they went to Boston unless you were there,you have never talked about a phone conversation so you ha to be there to know that / []
So where did you sleep? / []
But were you not overseas,you were not in London then / []
How can you say the photo is taken upstairs if you have never been there / []
Perhaps you were drunk when the photo was taken,lol / []
His dithering alone shows he is guilty,he is trying to make excuses for everything / []
Obviously the two situations are very very different but I find it funny the King Charles made the same excuse to Diana when he went to see Camilla before the wedding. “I just went to tell her that it’s over” “I went to tell him that we cannot be seen together” same excuse… both obviously lies / []
Still can’t believe he even does this interview. / []
Now that the Epstein list is  about to be revealed or has already be published, (I didn't closely follow the news  a few months ago) it is even more hilarious how he keeps denying his involment despite the hard evidence that is being presented to him at this very moment.  Unfortunately for him, the more he keeps up this innocent facade, the clearer it becomes to all of us how bad of a liar he is.  Though I hope that justice will be served, we will probably never get to see the very bottom of it. / []
If he never went upstairs 27:25 ,how does he know the photo was taken upstairs? / []
This man is an utter oily disgrace why are we subsidising this character from the civil list awful appalling character! / []
He’s such a liar 😅 / []
Prince Andrew 1980. Interviews / []
I thought this went well. / []
So he gave £13 million to a woman he never met🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ / []
When she said “Epstein is Dead” he laughed when he said “Yes” / ['At 40:36']
This interview just got more weird & bizarre as it went along, lol Personally, I have things from my childhood that are blocked out or blurry... due to trauma & a seizure condition, which is a natural effect.. but the extent to which this guy stutters through the ENTIRE interview (does he have a stuttering condition?) & the STORIES, including "I have a medical condition & I don't sweat, or at least I didn't sweat at the time"... there's things he says that you want to believe & then there's all these other things that sounds like he's countering it himSelf. I will say what he said about how people generally act differently around him as part of the royal family & that you don't go into certain environments necessarily looking to notice certain things about someone, until you look back & question certain things later on... those statements DO have categorical validity... & I think the fact that he's aware that people do act a certain way around royalty, I can understand that...  HOWEVER, it does call to mind that if anyone & everyone around Epstein "knew" SOMETHING was up with him of a questionable nature, even if they didn't know EXACTLY what, but they could tell, then you do have to wonder why Andrew NEVER noticed things as he claims, when he got to know the guy enough to spend time on his private properties... even to take a casual stroll with intent... yet why go out in the public with someone, that you claim the intention in speaking to them was to tell them that you DIDN'T want to be seen with them? That's just totally counterproductive! Like you couldn't just meet up with the guy somewhere private & have that sort of convo? Or have your secretary send him an official letter saying the prince no longer wants to maintain contact due to the allegations circulating about him... & if you had the guys' number, then why not send him a text saying as much? At least it would be documented & text messages are really solid proof of certain types of communication between people. / []
You thought you were a smarty bigger pompous ass than Putin? / []
After 2.45 minutes hes just laughable and already digging his own grave. / []
There's no way this guy is that dumb. He's spewing nonsense. What is the purpose of this? This was insane. Makes no rational sense. / []

It’s giving ICK. / []
As a  Pisces we don’t claim his ass! / []
You can see that he is convinced that he’s charming her. He’s completely out of touch with reality. He’s creepy and a bad actor / []
Well, the British public must continue paying for that guy. It's no fault on him some 15 year old girl threw herself at an entitled self absorbed narcissistic prick like him. His bestie was Gillian Maxwell how could he have ever known what she was up to with Jeffery Epstein it's not like she made that connection between her good friend and Jeffery. Does that dude really think we're that stupid? Oh wait we're just a bunch of common folk. He's a royal above our station how dare we judge him! / []

I return to this interview regularly / ['it is so funny']
Are you saying shes  lying....thats a very difficult question to answer ????? / []
This is GOLD!  Andrew dug himself into a hole he had no chance of clawing his way out.  He's intelligent (?) enough to know he shouldn't have had anything to do with this vile man Epstein, yet he did!!! / []
It’s now fact that Virginia GIUFFRE lied in her Statement to the Court re Prince Andrew - her solicitor has come forward and said so, so no argument there. Official Papers from USA COURT in MAXWELL CASE have proven, that the teenage Virginia was ‘no innocent’ young girl - she accepted from Epstein US $$150,00 to seduce Andrew & have sex with him …as part of a plot, to have something on him.   While being seduced by a young prostitute, experienced in these matters, Andrew did not ask her for her Birth Certificate - however - in U.K. such a coupling at 17, is not against the law, as everyone knows.  It could have been any guy taken in, even those hypocrites in Fleet Street, not adverse to a quickie themselves.    These US COURT PAPERS also revealed the shocking fact that Virgina GIUFFRE was a ‘’PIMP’’ … equal to a Brothel Madam, &, she had been at 17/18 + procuring young girls off the streets, runaways, &, Pimping them out to Epstein [ others ] for money - how industrious of her - obviously when it comes to earning ‘’money’’ any which way, Virginia is up for it !!    Now these ‘’facts’’ that were proven in Court in USA - with WITNESSES & STATEMENTS - were very far from the ‘’pitiful tale’’ that was ‘’acted out’’ to land Andrew is the deepest shit.  Obviously, when it comes to lies, opportunism, exploitation, Virginia GIUFFRE for money, is extremely well versed - equipped - to ACT IT OUT.   Andrew was the ‘’mark’’ the ‘’patsey’’  ….. being from the Royal Family, a ‘’Sitting Duck’’ for a scam of this kind.    10 years later - or was it or longer - Virginia long forgotten - in need of money …. the Scam was put in place - not by Epstein, but by his named Co-Conspirator  - millions of $$$$ / ££££ - to be extorted one way or the other. The British Press had a field day - there were no questions asked - Andrew was immediately found ‘’guilty’’ from the ‘’get go’’ ….. the Wolves closed round, it was journalistic ‘’feeding time’’ to sell newspapers!!    Ah the poor innocent girl - oh - how terrible - salivating - journalists could not have been more happy, pigs in muck, as it were, all at the trough.   Of course it was 99% certain, they has in youth had sex with a girl of 17 in the U.K. but hey - forget that - the HYPOCRISY WON THROUGH.    THE QUEEN DEVASTATED, sadly never knew the real truth she died in ignorance of it, such is life, it was a terrible blow, that no one gave a thought - it might be a set up, so may years had passed, memories gone / faded the scam was full proof.    Andrew left ‘holding the baby’’ well and truly stuffed a lamb to the slaughter - not the sharpest knife in the block - was SHAFTED!! Called a ‘Peadophile’ it was a catastrophic Desaster - ruined him - yet it was all in reality a ‘’set up’’ planned / executed for money - many years before by EPSTEIN & VIRGINIA GIUFFRE - with Epstein dead - his vile reputation known, Virginia knew she had Andrew as U.K. Royalty - by the balls - it cost him Millions of £££££ ‘s  on lies, but it’s not just the money - it’s ruined his life, it’s appalling. / ['Mate, wtf is wrong with you']
28:06 creepy / []

i was walking down the mall once when the police stopped me and everyone else - we weren't allowed to cross a narrow driveway - we were all stuck there for about 20 minutes even though crossing would've taken just seconds - eventually along came a very slow rolls royce with prince andrew and princess anne in the back - and only when it passed through the driveway into buckingham palace were we allowed to proceed on - yet he claimed he could be in pizza hut for a low profile party whilst other people were in there too - his privileged life clearly meant he thought he could take us for fools. / []
It can possibly be true because I can’t sweat because I am a traumatised war hero. ( bead of sweat runs down forehead). / []
I wonder how it would have played out if he had never done this interview. It could not have been worse. / []
The shit about not being able to sweat has to be one of the most made up things that’s ever been made up / ['What do you mean, made up?? That is medical proof this did not happen…']

Megan and Henry expressed feeling like slaves in the royal family, while it seemed that some other members enjoyed freedom, like a bird😅He comes across as a stuttering pathological liar who lost his memory, intelligence, and dignity in just 45 minutes.

How'd this all end ? Does anybody know?? 🙄🙄🤔🤭😅😅😅😅 / []
12:47 the following minute is kinda funny / []
dirty freak bstrd ! / []
If you’ve noticed, there were a few time where he would say no and nod yes, and vice versa. Clear indication he is lying. Another indication is that when he is making up stories, he is looking elsewhere and his eyes are moving frantically. It is clear he is making it up on the spot. / []

Ripped apart Punjab, have the best part, Lahore to Pakistan, Sikhs have fought & died valiantly for people half way across the world, who think nothing of being racist, how about you teach your children about Sikhs, who we are, what we did for the people of this nation, I put money on it that racism will be halved overnight, but the history lessons have zero taken of the British empire, it’s your history, if it’s not taught, no one will know / []
And now Sikh historical swords & other valued treasures are turning up at auctions, for example Maharaja Ranjit Singhs black sword was auctioned off for tens of thousands, luckily a Sikh patriot purchased it, but we shouldn’t have to purchase our history from thieves who helped themselves, so it’s a different when you guys do the thievery & another set of rules for the rest of us, the Kohinoor diamond was chopped up into 6 pieces, it’s not your property to do that! Prince Albert committed this travesty at Crystal Palace world fair exhibition that had people displayed like animals from around the world, it beggars belief / []
The reason Andy Pandy went to see Jeffroi in the park was due to getting his begging bowl out to ask for a $125,000 “loan”; to pay Fergies debts & to say I wanted to end the friendship face to face, “honourable” doesn’t come close to the reality of the situation, shamelessly taking bribes, selling his Sunningdale marital home to a dodgy Kazakh billionaire that bought the house for millions & the Kazakh guy didn’t even live there & never fixed it up, it was demolished to the best of my knowledge, when I end a friendship, the last thing I would want to do is see that person face to face, it’s ridiculous, it beggars belief, Jeffroi set up fir the picture in the park, you got played like a cheap fiddle / []
He must think we’re all stupid & believe any old rubbish he spouts on about, this excuse for a man has 80 teddy bears that have to be arranged from large to small, based on a laminated picture showing how to set the display up & god forbid you get it wrong, he becomes a petulant child & screams at the help - what a horrid way to behave / []

Hold on,  I notice that pic of him with that young Girl, he   doesn't looks of his 60 yr old!!   (That is how looks when he was still married with Fergie Or Just after his divorce with her).    Hi!   That pic is  creation. Loo!! , How he looks his past 5 old  yrs, old??   That case issues with Epstein, is isn't it only happened  last  2/ 3 yrs?? / ['It was taken in 2001']
I agree that P. Andrew that can recollect he had photograh with that You young Girl.  Cuz being a Famous person,it's not unusual for him to meeting have caressing  through hand touched together. And it's possibly it happened,  but he knows that, it's  been normal for him to have that,  "exciting meeting with deferent ppl of  ages who are  eager to greet him and wishing  to have closeness relationship with him and be able to have a good chat, too".  Like he is  being used to greeted with multitude of pll,  "it's possible he is not so, aware of his unplanned  closeness of caressing moments". / ["He cannot recollect his caressing with the young Girl. Cuz he :s been used to be greeted with eagerness of ppl.  So, he doesn't need bto out it on his memories. Unless, its a planned that he has to greet /hug  this  Pub figure  being.  (This way,  anyone can recall this).", 'Also, I would like to add my comments. "That any  Celebritis don \'t need to remember who Caressing her /him  due to being normal for ppl to do  that way to their Fans", right?']
I wish she asked him why he has 72 teddy bears on his bed. / []
Liar Liar pants on fire 🔥 / []
21:06....I remember it weirdly distinctively but as soon as somebody reminds me of it...oh yes I remember that....😂😂. He contradicted himself just that quick.   You remember it so well but if someone reminds you about it, it means you aren't remembering it like you claim you are...😂😂 / []
So full of bullshit / []
This guy is guilty as hell / []
34:28 If you are somebody like me, then people behave in a subtly different way......What an absolute prick! 😂😂 / []
He just say 3 times a year .. then after he said he only seen him 4 times in total hummm / ["My lad lies better than this guy and my lad ain't that good at it lol"]
Love him asking about the victim's / []
What have you done to able to sweat again 😂😂😂😂😂😂😊 / []
That picture was taken up stairs I never been upstairs I just know we're how upstairs looks like but I swear I never been there / []
" My tendency to be too honorable " Im sorry,  i just can't 😂😂😂  The irony.. 🤦‍♀️ / ['😊']
Thats a lier at work. Damn would like to slap his disgusting face. Peace od shit. Nasty pig. / []
I come back and watch this at least twice a year, absolute gold. / ['The film is coming 04/05 Netflix. Scoop the name.', '@LuzDoSol-yr5bvI just watched the trailer.', '@ells80 Looks great! The cast is insane.', '😂so true', 'Fuck netflix bro, original much better.']
He's gross af.... / []
28:05 / []
If nobody can prove if the photo is real or fake. Then the picture is real. Experts can tell a fake photo from a mile away. The photo is 100% real. / []
To think after all this he was caiught groping his daughter... opportunistic predatory behaviour on full display / []
Comedy gold / []
When they asked him if he would do an interview...he said no sweat / []
It’s horrifying to live in a society where his actions are acceptable but not paying traffic tickets ruins lives / ["We don't live in a society where this is acceptable", '@benx6549is that why he has not served a single day of jail time?']
He's lying / []
Lmao / []
31:09 / ['28:05']
HE LOOKS LIKE A PEDOPHILE / []
he said: " it was a convenient place to stay".....  guilty as hell.. and he probably got epstein killed / []
I don't no why you lot don't leave our prince Andrew alone, he fought in that war, then he married, and stay with his wife, in fact he should be king, not that bloody mest  up Charles, with his hur marriage destroyer, leave Andrew alone, the best looking of the lot, didn't you all see the Queen love him; we want him as king, love you Andrew! / ['🤡', "Probably because he's a pedophile and terrible liar, but that aside your spelling is atrocious"]
It's embarrassing listening to this  load of lies and bullshit.  This is a man who we the tax payers have paid.millions of pounds to him and his corrupt family for years.  This is what we get back as appreciation of our loyalty as law abiding citizens. / []
Prince Andrew's behaviour in this BBC interview resembles Najib Razak in another similar interview!!😂😂😂 / []
Strange how she gets to interview Prince Andrew,  take all the credit for it - even though shes asking questions most of us would ask,  and works for the BBC. If she has that many principles  -  maybe she should not take a salary off the very institution that covered up for sex offenders for decades whilst forcing us to pay their massive salaries? total hypocrisy / ['You do realise that she is a professional journalist and this is her job? Same way I can make coffee but a trained barista will do it better than me? I’m sure  her immense research and interview expertise you could reproduce to the same standards? Best you stick to reading the Daily Mail 😊', 'EPSTEN TRYS HARD']
That picture is real not fake / []
"Should I go see him after hes been a conviced sex offender or shouldnt I 🤔 since hes black mailing me with evidence of my own sex offences I think I should.  Its a real shame hes dead now, died in prision all the cameras were off all the gards were asleep" just a fiction I made up / []
Makes me sick this! / []
You have to be a little bit impressed with Prince Andrew. He was able to comically fumble his way through this entire interview,  with all the while, able to keep that silver spoon securely lodged in his ass! / ["Did it no sweat he's honourable😂"]
Wow. Narcissism at its finest I feel bad for his daughters / ["Look up him feeling his daughter up if you haven't seen it. When the queen died. He's disgusting"]
10:17 there it is / []
Second hand embarrassment watching this / []
Randy Andy blabbering on again / []
He paid her compensation out of court. GUILTY / ['Mummy paid it. Still sleeps with his Teddy bears']
He should be on trial. Cant help but think Sarah's health scares are good distraction / []
He's a pea dough, just like Donald Trump. / []
Prince Andrew should write romance novels and name the first book "Non-sweaty Positive Action". / ['The honourable gentleman 😂']
I can’t believe this was aired. The most damning interview ever / ['Allegedly they thought it was a good idea...']
Remember what happened to lord mountbatten. / ['Why?']
JAIL HIM! / []
This guy definitely didn’t consult with a crisis management team before agreeing to the interview / []
He is not the only one in the RF Sweating now ! / []
This interview is just 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 peak content ! / []
Hats off to the interviewer for being able to sit there being lied too on basically every question she asked!! SMH / []
Royal scumbag 🤮 / []
i wanna puke / []
You can tell he is lying by the increased blinking / []
Only cause you are menber of the royal go to prison / []
Please  you need to prison / []
Prat... / []
Let him go stick his filthy fingers in Charles arse 😢😢😂😂😂 / ['Charles was pprob doing that to him from a young age...  like uncle mountbatten did with charlie😂']
He should be in prison and not be allowed to hide behind the royals. / []
It was a convenient place to stay 😂 / []
I let the side down. Simple as that, Rather. / []
Child abuser son of a b. / []
If you're being interviewed about your relationship with a sex trafficking pedophile don't talk about his ability to bring people together. / []
The Behavior Panel on YouTube did a fantastic analysis of this interview. / []
This prince is not an extraordinary person. He is simple a playboy, son of a queen. A typical noble, no brain, no morals. / []
Poor man, he clearly has PTSD. Why I will never forgive the Argentinians for the Falklands War. They did this / ['😂😂 them blasted argies', '@dingdong00002 another act of war in my eyes...stop wasting time with these Houtis']

What a lieing dickhead total tool. Andrew is an embarrassment to men and human beings... Shame on this wretched outing of brainless privileged  royal numbskull / []
SOMEBODY SHOULD SEND THE PRINCE A LOT OF TOILET PAPER BECAUSE HE IS FULL OF YOU KNOW WHAT / []
Popcorn TV. Watching him squirm is sold gold entertainment. I just gave millions $$ to a girl I never met. / []
EVERY BODY KNOWS HE IS GUILTY BUT HE WILL NEVER GO TO JAIL AND WE ALL KNOW WHY / []
IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE BRITISH PEOPLE ACCEPT THIS PEDERASTER AS LEADERS OF THEIR NATION. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, BRITISH PEOPLE? ARE YOU BLIND OR JUST STUPID??? I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT CHARLES, THE MAIN STUPID MAN IN THE WORLD. SHAME OF YOU. / []
He’s a moron with his answers lol / []
It's fascinating watching someone dig their own grave live on television, especially when you have Google beside you. "I don't drink" - A five second Google search shows him tasting wine; "I don't know where that club is" - a short Google search show it was the location of his first date with Koo Stark. My God, this is a dumpster fire. / []
He’s a useless scumbag. / []
The way the interviewer said "Unbecoming? He was a sex offender" was so funny, I would have believed it was from a comedy sketch had I been sent a clip for it out of context. / []
The chickens way of doing it!!! 😅 oh dear Randy Andy  Pathetic / []
That was painful to watch / []
Oh so convenient he can recall going to that random (but super specific- important note on liars) pizza place that one time, but not remember meeting or sleeping with a girl who he's seen in photographs with. / []
Everything about this is so crazy lol. He really thinks people will believe him? Mind blowing / []
this so called prince he is a lier.... he stutters stammers ...he is a wrong man... he protects hisself  and a foolish person what a shame !!!!! / []
Andrew was not that close to Epstein - & - now we read the facts - Epstein paid Virginia GIUFFRE US $$$ 150,000 to seduce Andrew and have sex with him - as a young prostitute she took the job - facts come out now -  latterly as a teenage Prostitute & Pimp, Virginia drove round town, looking for underage street girls - runaways - she Pimped out to Epstein for money …. Quite the MADAM …..Court Papers in USA CONFIRM THESE FACTS - THAT CAME OUT IN MAXWELL TRIAL ……. Andrew was their ‘’Mark’’ ….. the ‘’Sucker’’ …….taken for a ride - now millions out of pocket on a bag of Virginia GIUFFRE lies - made up stories - even her solicitor is saying now - Virginia lied about Andrew in her statement !!! / []

STOP THE HYPOCRISY AT THE BBC - WHERE’S THE INTERVIEW WITH TEEN PROSTITUTE / PIMP VICTORIA GIUFFRE !!! / []
weapons manufacturing, support for murdered children in Gaza, leaders have sex with children, what such countries decides all over the world. / []
I have no recollection of anything incriminating but a Pizza Express donkeys years ago I can remember the date/time and the fact it was in Woking 😂 / []
HYPOCRISY AT THE BBC -  over teenage prostitute / pimp Victoria GIUFFRE who was paid by Epstein to seduce x have sex with Andrew, $150,000 - a nice litter earner at the time for Victoria - no doubt one of many - payed dividends later, telling lies, playing lol the innocent trafficked girl - like hell - in US COURT PAPERS RE MAXWELL, Virginia is exposed as a PIMP at 17/18 for Epstein [ witness statements on file & evidence given confirming it ]  she drove round picking up young Street Girls - Runaway’s paid them some cash & then PIMPED THEM OUT TO EPSTEIN FOR MONEY …..a TEENAGE MADAM …..there’s no denying it, its Court Confirmed - even Virginia’s solicitor is now saying she lied about Andrew ….. what a STING …..she’s walked off with millions on a pack of lies, Andrew left broke, as a member of Royal Family he was ripe and vulnerable to being ‘’set up’’ …….the British Press with a phoney photo, found him ‘’Guilty’’ so to avoid more publicity, protesting innocence, he paid up ……SUCKER !!!      Someone out there really wants Andrew destroyed, been to a lot of trouble to do it via Press - even now when Virginia GIUFFRE exposed as a liar - prostitute  & Pimp ……the pressure is up, Andrew hardly knew him, compared to US CLINTON & CO - where was MI5 - Security to Warn Andrew off - as the Queens son - let him know he was at risk re Epstein - nowhere it seems even they were fooled …… the false fairy story Virginia told is shown to be a ‘’pack of lies’’ …… will Andrew get his money back - no -  so as the PATSY in this scam by Epstein/Virginia …. the MARK …. set up by them both - he’s the Victim - that’s been ROYALLY SCREWED …….

mor important things.. we are inviting prince Andrewand his family to please join us, the iranians, to drive motorcoaches from Germany to Ukraine to turkey to Israel , to islamic republic of iran to change it back into iran the fee country of the British empire. / []
His protection officers would have a detailed record of every shift they worked with him. If they were released, those shift reports would prove beyond doubt about where he was on any given day.  Strange how he doesn’t reference these at any point. / ['Fantastic observation. Very true. Funny how these things never get that far. He should be in jail instead of doing this interview and slowly burying hinself.', 'My thoughts too.']
If I recall Prince Andrew acted as doorman for at least one if not 2 young women when he was on his “goodbye Jeffrey tour”. Nobody seems to ask him about his doorman duties at the Epstein mansion in 2010. Guilty as charged! / []
He is a LIAR and a PRETIDOR / []
Prince Andrew and jeffy Epstein  both lied on sex tape / []
😅😅😅😅😅funny as fuck / []
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
Such a train wreck. / []
Thank god his mother stripped him of all his affiliations and royal patronages before her death. Andrews grave will probably tie with Thatcher for most popular public urinal / []
My god... My god... / []
My boy said “I didn’t sweat…at the time” 😂😂 who else remembers that they didn’t sweat March 10 2001. / ['😭😭😭😭overdose of adrenaline my ass']

He’s just a spoilt mummies boy. He got away with blue murder all his life..and he actually believed this interview would get him off the hook. Not that the scales of justice will tilt against him. / []
Wow..Cringe / []

Just watched the Netflix documentary on Epstein and associates… how is this man not in prison? The world we live in is so corrupt / ['nah just the people that work in it', "Because he's rich", 'Because he’s part of the untouchable elite', 'this @j_c2225', "What is required to see Jeffrey Epstein and why did you go over to his New York apartment why did you go over there nothing to be said about your multiple load Andrew cos a clean didn't want you to do royal duties"]
Guys it's pretty obvious this man was an innocent bystander caught up in the Epstein whirlwind. / ['If he’d just answered every question saying he was an innocent bystander caught up in the Epstein whirlwind he’d have probably done better.', "@BassAcoustic-ww1eu Agree. You'd think a member of the royal family would be a better liar."]
Simple example of how a person made fool of himself by doing that interview / []

absolute classic / []
It’s Andrew who’s a wasted talent as a actor and not Edward unfortunately lol……what a complete shitshow this was / []
Not seen this for a while... 🎉🎉 crazy thow he is... Darren G is Legend 💪💪 / []
The interview was a riveting spectacle, a true rollercoaster of excitement. Bravo, your highness! I mean, who needs ordinary mortals when we have a prince gracing us with his presence? Clearly, good "breading" is the secret ingredient to his intellectual feast. Move over, mere commoners, we're in the presence of interview royalty! 👑Two words. Shovel, hole..... / []
"I was at hone with the children.." !!!😛😜🤠 / []

I didnt even need to watch the video. As soon as i saw this guys face i already thought pedophile. Prince Andrew, ure a pig / []
Through hard work and perseverance I learned to sweat again. / []
Full of shit should be jailed lifestyles of some rich and famous individuals is sick - stop covering up for money / []
"We all knew him" - 41:23 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Andrew Pinocchio 😂😂😂 / []
Prince Andrew and Vladimir Putin and many other kids of the rich and famous kids all have sex trafficking child kiddy porn videos and films and tapes and pictures from Elaine maxwell and Jeffery eupstine just like Vladimir Putin and I that have kiddy sex trafficking kiddy porn videos and films and tapes and pictures from the sex parties and friends of Her Majesty the Queen of Englands friends like king Faisal Abdullah Adziz that Vladimir Putin and i have as Mrs Angel Abdullah Adziz king Faisal Abdullah Adziz childhood wife that had been invited to a party at Her Majesty the Queen of Englands child kiddy porn  party by king Faisal wife where i was invited to Russia to be with the young Vladimir Putin where we made some kiddy porn films and tapes and pictures in our kiddy porn videos and films and tapes and pictures with numerous other children to make kiddy porn videos and films and tapes and pictures with many other kids that we all made kiddy porn videos and films and pictures of orgies hunts by the late king Faisal Abdullah Adziz as Mrs Angel Abdullah Adziz / []
Rodney...you plonker😮 / []
Simple logic: A quilty mind, who is a member of the Royal Family, would not go for a walk in the park. An honest mind could have the need to stop the contact in person.  Because an honest mind could need to keep the relation with the (at that point innocent ) partner G. Maxwell ongoing, simply because of their friendship.  In my eyes, Andrew talks with honesty in his eyes. / []
About time the entire royal family were done away with. Pompous,over pampered shits that scrounge off the taxpayer much more than any jobless plumber in Liverpool or unemployed gas fitter in Sunderland ever would. / []
hum..."I was doing other things over the three days I was there" I think we all can guess what he was doing.  What a sickening, depraved pathological liar.  After the interview, he prob said to himself, "I was just dang good...fooled all of them."  🤣 / []
How would Andrew know the photo was of upstairs when he repeatedly said he never went upstairs? / ['You can see the stairs and banister in the whole picture to the left of Andrew']
Guilty ass / []
So you went for a walk in Central Park with Jeffrey Epstein, a child molester. That must have been a lovely day out Andrew 😢 / []
The part where he said he doesn't sweat had me laughing out loud, what a freaking p.o.s. / []
Oh COME ON ! / []
8:26 / []
8:30 / []
8:00 / []
Govno smrdljivo od incesta stvoreno. / []
As guilty as Godilocks / []
I am embarrassed for him / []
Virginia Giueffre was sent to Japan  by maxwell and there she met her future husband. Yet she claims she couldn't get away from Epstein. Not making sense to me? / ['Whole thing is hazy. I expect it would be in her interest to exaggerate certain details. She got an absolutely enormous payout from all this after all. \n\nWould be interesting to know if she was in on the whole blackmail setup plots, if that’s what these things were.']
I pity him for the anxious moments he went through during this interview.  I myself was freakin out from those questions she's asking / ['He deserves that.. he’s a disgusting person']
Its shows how out of touch the royals are with the public. Its actually insulting and funny at the same time that we were expected to believe this / ['Mind boggling really. I saw an interview where someone thought Andrew must have been trolling here, but like you I think it was a genuine attempt to prove innocence. \n\nThe part where he said he was racking his brain thinking if sleeping with Virginia could’ve happened, but determined he had no recollection of meeting her, was particularly jaw dropping. Imagine being accused of something like that and having to rack your brain for whether it happened or not. \n\nThen the sweating, pizza express garbage was just way over the top. It’s like that Ian Huntley interview where he went into major detail about why he was outside talking to them, details of his dog being messy blah blah blah. It seems people like to come up with a very thorough story of why they’re innocent, and overdo it by rambling nonsense. \n\nThe fact he refused to criticise Virginia was telling too. If someone “falsely” accuses you and tries to ruin your life, I think you’d be a bit more stern in how you speak about them. What a car crash this was.']
So you pay a person £12M who you say you have Never Met  😂😂Wow 😂😂 that’s tells me he’s Guilty! / []
🤣 / []
Im no expert but he is lying through his teeth, people like Andrew are born in to privilege and behave so poorly, its obvious he thought hed be able to talk his way out of his situation but he totally underestimated the interviewer, to me he comes across as blithering bafoon, shame on him. / []
Wow wow sir you should not have done this interview you  are stuttering sound like you are lying even if you are telling the truth eye speak truth mouth speak lies you it wosent me shaggy mr honestly damn / []
…Can’t believe a word he utters . Neither an. officer. nor a gentleman . / []
Bet he played tickle, tickle with fxckly daughters when mummy wasn't there ??? He's been known to be kind to pets at 1st meeting but then they shy away with tail between legs. / []
Andy's new project is early child hood Centers where children learn new no holes bared skills & games like hide the sausage & Andy's favorite hole in one & back door. Guaranteed your children will never be the same. Discounts for under privileged & inept persons. People with drug addictions & disabilities welcomed. See you on the inside King Andy / []
How can you  deny a photograph ? / ["Well we just saw the palace themselves fake photos. It is very possible Virginia went overboard in naming alleged predators. We know she tried to suggest Alan dershowitz was involved and he shut her up real quick. It's very possible Andrew didn't do anything with the girls but because he was the most vulnerable high profile name when listed him. It's not difficult to fake a photo, but also a photo with him doesn't mean the rest of it was true. Virginia in particular was shown to be spoofing with names to try get money"]
He's honorable but it's Maxwells problem.  HIs so called friend. The only reason why he was at Epstiens, so he said / []
I don't believe him. He stalls too much before responding... He knew, he took, part, and now he lies to cover up his involvement. His eyes say more than what his mouth is actually spewing. Just my opinion. / []
He appears to know a lot of people that don't tell the truth... !! It's like a child giving a bad explanation on how the family dog eat there homework....he wasn't that close to Epstien so he travelled all that way to break the friendship off... / []
Just like R Kelly, there are many instances where he denies something or says no, but nods his head yes. Busted! / []
This man is so obviously guilty. / []
Really Andrew, you want us to believe, the reason you went to see him was to show, you were not chickening out!??????!!!😮Really!! You are royal and you wanted to go and tell him in person , you are breaking up with him ?!!!!!😮 You think people are so stupid to buy it? That is really a 14 years old teenage girl behavior. Very well studied but I am so sorry that was the only lame explanation your advisers could come up with!! / []
This interview was sooooo embarrasing to watch!! He is an arrogant tosser!! / []
liar, liar, pants on fire....but i spent several nights at epstein's house...right....I call it HOGWASH! / []
Andrew, behave !!! 😂😂😂😂 / []
Even with playback speed 1.25x he talks slow / []
Absolutely typical behaviour of a criminal: "Look Jeff, we can't be seen together ever again. All our future meetings and parties with girls will have to be kept completely secret. See you next month then, buddy!" / []
Traits of a liar! / []
"You have to remember that ONLY if you are a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody. Whereas if you are a woman it does not have to be a positive act and can easily be forgotten." This is a direct quote from HRH Andrew's mind. I am going to go and throw up somewhere now. What a royal pig. / []
Bloody good , bloody good. / []
The ultra rich, have stolen everything from the working class, now this. / []
Lying scumbag should be locked up / []

Wait till the videos tapes are released. / []
What this interview really means, is the good working people of this World, are in fact tired of being shit-on by all these , so called elites. / []
Bloody good. He is an honorable chap , in fact he is too honorable. He tells us this. Ouch / []
More evidence, how the elites have , thrown the working class, overboard. / []
This bloke is a good liar. / []

In a hoodie and as part of a serious crime gang, this man would be saying 'no comment' at the end of each question or elucidated description of an alleged event. A few years on, one is reminded of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak at the Covid enquiry. The facial ticks are similar. The elongation of vowels and the expressions of faux surprise. Most of all, the lack of recollection. The shiftiness in expression when they know they have been confronted with something they know to be true but wish to deny, presented to them in a particularly forensic manner - as with Ms Maitlis' quite superb and beautifully prepared set of questions. This man volunteered to take part in this interview. Astonishing. But - sadly - not shocking. Power and influence, eh? / []
🚨BULLSHIT ALERT!🚨BULLSHIT ALERT!🚨BULLSHIT ALERT!🚨 / []

Nobody can prove… yes Andrew, you proved it yourself by your ridiculous answers 😂😂😂😂 / []

Carrying on with what he does scary / []
The photo was authenticated by the fbi and no one questioned its authenticity until Maxwell and Andrew said it was fake. They claim to have evidence against the photo but the prince already proved that they dont have anything against it as he settled the lawsuit and payed the victim instead of presenting proof against the photo. / []
You can hear the truth in everything he says by his tone and phrasing. He visited Epstein because he had to speak face to face, away from the house where he could be recorded, to make sure he wasn’t going to drag him down with him. The picture cannot be proven to be real or fake, so I don’t have to comment on it categorically. We speak in the house about how he got to his position - by luring elites into disadvantaged positions… it’s all so obvious. He says it without saying, what a talent. / []
36:52 … also an exposing Moment . The lies stuck in his dry throat ! / []
31:13 … that was a brilliant question and look how he can’t handle it . He has to lie in the face of this abused,brave woman again and one realize that it bothers him a lot . By the way he can’t be honest because if he would he would end up in jail . / []
I think Prince Andrew is very impolite to the lady Journalist by insulting her intelligence with his cheap lies . / []
What 2:00 … what a weird explanation „ He had the ability to bring extraordinary people together“ ! / []

ANDREW IS LOYAL TO ROYAL FAMILY, TO THE LATE QUEEN & HIS BROTHER - & - unlike Harry was indeed a real War Hero having flown a helicopter in battle conditions, on many occasions, his courageousness cannot be undermined.  True he was ‘’scammed’ by a proven teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE - as is 100% confirmed by US COURT MAXWELL Documents, her own recent comments & even her solicitor has recently said, she lied about her connection / activities with Andrew.    Facts are, Andrew was smeared, set up, &, tried and found guilty by the U.K. Press - in fact - there is an accusation, that the Daily Mail sent a journalist to Australia, to see Virginia, with the intention of having her attack, &, tell stories about Prince Andrew, re Epstein, ‘’juicing it up’’, to create as much harm as possible, to destroy his reputation, that has in fact been the case; backing him into a corner to:  ‘’PAY UP MILLIONS’’ on what are seen now,  as mostly gross lies by a teenage Prostitute for money - who was paid by Epstein to seduce Andrew, have sex with him for $$ 50,000 ….. it was a set up, a honey trap, whatever you want to call it by Epstein & his teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE ……. to enable them to extort / blackmail him for money later - in fact it’s very clear in this instant as is now ‘confirmed 100%’  that Andrew was the sucker - the VICTIM - of a planned sting …. he’s certainly paid dearly for it and been wrongly blamed as a Peadophile - which is totally wrong !!!    How many men in U.K. have had sex with a 17 year old girl, most likely have the male population …or more… so stop the bloody nonsense and hypocrisy -  comments as made here against Andrew are lies and appalling HYPOCRISY!!! / ['You must be prince andrew the way you typed out such a dumb response to all this. To say half of the male population in the UK have interactions with younger girls is insane and has nothing to do with andrew’s own wrong doing with epstien and the victims. Lock that thug up']

I am going to state my opinion about this story and Prince Andrew that may not be popular and may go against the way a lot of people feel about this story, but I will say it anyway.   I think that Prince Andrew probably did have sex with Virginia Roberts but I definitely do not believe that he raped her or forced her to do anything.  By her own admission, Jeffrey Epstein paid her for sleeping with Prince Andrew and I believe the amount that she claimed that she was paid was approximately $15,000. In fact, another young girl who worked for Epstein at the time in 2001, named Carolyn Andriano, gave an interview in which she claimed that Virginia Roberts bragged about having slept with Prince Andrew. She said that Roberts thought that it was "pretty cool" to have slept with Prince Andrew. Carolyn Andriano went on to say "I don't think she was coerced into doing anything".  She also said that she does not believe that Virginia Roberts deserved any compensation at all for sleeping with Prince Andrew. She was referring to the millions of dollars that Virginia Roberts was suing Prince Andrew for.    My personal belief is that Prince Andrew is an arrogant foolish guy that feels entitled by his royal status, but I do not believe that he is a criminal or a rapist. Just an arrogant fool. Roberts was also 17 years old at the time which was a legal age to have sex in many venues. She was very young but not a child. When she was recruited to work for Jeffrey Epstein, Roberts was working in the locker room at the Mar A Lago country club in Florida. She was probably making approximately minimum wage, in other words, just several dollars an hour. From her lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew, she would go on to become a multi-millionaire. I have read that she now lives in a $1.9 million dollar home in Australia and she has millions of dollars. If she never met Jeffrey Epstein, she might very well still have some poorly paid job as she does not have a higher education. Although she would never admit it publicly, I would not be in the least surprised if she secretly believes that meeting Jeffrey Epstein was the luckiest thing that ever happened to her. I do not think that Prince Andrew is a predator. I think that he is just an arrogant dope. I think that it is Virginia Roberts who is the predator. I think she is not much more than a predatory liar who wanted to make money out of this story. / ['Well said my friend, sense at last!!!']

SARAH HAS BEEN LOYAL, PATIENT, HELPFUL, WORKED HARD - SHE DESERVES TO BE BACK IN ROYAL FOLD - after the Sting Andrew has had put on him - Andrew foolishly got friendly with Epstein who wanted to use Andrew for his legitimate business reasons - however - he set Andrew up, with teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE paying GIUFFRE very well US $$15,000 to seduce and have sex with Andrew - to use against him later - it’s called Blackmail, a filthy business, illegal of course, but both GIUFFRE & EPSTEIN were on the wrong side of the Law in their dealings together.   It was recently confirmed from US COURT PAPERS IN MAXWELL CASE that Virginia GIUFFRE  17/18 acted as a teenage PIMP for Epstein, witnesses in the Maxwell case gave evidence, confirming this - GIUFFRE would troll around looking for young street girls, runaways, pay them money - & - PIMP them out to Epstein for a lot of money — no innocent Virginia a paid sex worker at 17 & acting as a PIMP as well ……….all those newspaper articles painting her as an innocent girl, lol, sexually exploited by Andrew, is a load of bullshit, lies, far from it - Andrew was the Mark - the Sucker - lured into a trap by Epstein & Virginia - lol - what a fool Andrew was to befriend Epstein, who only wanted to use him - & - latterly Blackmail him !!!      Andrew as paid out money to Virginia GIUFFRE on a pack of lies - millions of pounds - as he was tried and found guilty in the Press - what a set up - his reputation destroyed on a pack of lies - as the Queens son he was always vulnerable to a ‘’sting’’ of this kind - rumour has it that a U.K. NEWSPAPER JOURNALIST went to Australia to talk Virginia GIUFFRE into accusing Andrew & a story was concocted  -  why would a newspaper want to deliberately hurt Andrew - ummmm - who is behind it - Andrew has enemies it seems  HYPOCRITES that mean him harm - most of whom it’s likely had sex at 17 - with a girl the same age  [ not a teenage prostitute ] and the girls were not paid thousands of US $ to sleep with them - so it’s hard to understand the ‘’outrage’’ now the truth is known, Andrew was in fact the victim of a set up - its admitted now - you would think these Hypocrites would shut up - but no - they are still after blood - spite / malice it continues …. / []
2,3 times a year how abt 10,20 times n what happened on epsteiens treasure island / []
It’s incredible no one from royal family stopped this interview midway through .. what a disaster.. among worst in history / []
Why would Espein take a picture of Andrew and a 17 y old, and would use the young lady’s camera? This sounds fishy / []
Basically Epstein was running a hoar house/island filming them and then holding them to random / []
What an eloquent, long long way to dig this man into his own hole with his own answer. The interviewer is absolutely brilliant. Question by question, she lambasted him, and he dug himself deeper, answer by answer. Word by word. / []
There is only one way to stop people like this cockroach and his friends. Cancellation of the worst kind. / []
Andrew is just a pawn being sacrificed. And rightfully so, but he isn't the true evil.   If you want to know who's behind all of this, all you need to do is read the Talmud. / []
THIS INTERVIEW IS HYPOCRISY - The Hypocrisy of these entries and statements against Andrew are breathtaking - he’s been a fool alright, most of us have at some time, his being set up my Epstein, for a ‘’sting’’ is now public knowledge,  after Epstein paid teenage Prostitute Virginia GIUFFRE a very large sum of money US $$150,000 to seduce and have sex with Andrew ……she willingly did it for the money - he was not the first man she’d had sex with, &, the set up, had to be for ‘Blackmail’ at a later date - we all know Blackmail is illegal !!     All the game play previously, the Press jumped on of Virginia being an innocent trafficked girl is ‘’nonsense - lies’’ …. as Formal Court Papers in USA ON MAXWELL CASE confirm GIUFFRE was acting as a PIMP for Epstein, picking up young street girls, runaways, at 17/18  and pimping them out to Epstein for money - as a Madam !!   So it’s confirmed Andrew was ‘’set up’’ …….Virginia no innocent was paid handsomely to seduce and have sex with him - Prostituting herself for money ….. in fact it was Andrew who was the ‘’victim here - the mark’’ …… it most certainly was not Virginia GIUFFRE  the experienced Prostitute and Pimp …… who knew exactly what she was doing - & - that it was wrong !!!       Will the Press apologise - no one holds their breath, but there is something nasty hidden here - a malicious intent to ruin Andrew at all costs - it’s extremely noticeable, suspicious, given the known facts today HYPOCRISY TAKEN TO A NEW LEVEL - WHO IS BEHIND IT !!!! / []

Epstein was a zillionaire anyway and could have had all the underage girls he ever wanted. It’s not difficult with enough cash. So why cultivate the rich and famous?  Apart from adding to his ego, he did so to protect himself of course. I bet he spotted Prince nice-but-dim Andrew a mile off, in just the same way he could sniff out girls who were vulnerable.   Hence taking Andrew for a long walk in Central Park in broad daylight when he knew perfectly well the world's media were photographing it. / []

Greetings.  From what I know, I studied, investigated and found out that what is sought and investigated apart from carrying out a justice process for possible witnesses and victims of a purely political case, is to investigate whether the possibility that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered is true and supplanted by some aspiring public politician when he was younger and worked as a banker; I believe what should be investigated is that people or individuals currently react within various types of public or private businesses, or how they reacted within various companies or operations upon learning of the case since they used aliases or nicknames referring to names similar to those mentioned. found on Epstein's famous list. What happens if an individual named Daniel Miles Alejandro, who was or is ex-military and who works in a security company that monitors pests and in his free time plays video games or through short radio signals using the alias George Lucas? Or is George Lucas pedo's besieged and harassed by young men, young women, boys or girls since they work for political links of some official political party and they want to blackmail him? ... What happens to individuals who still have sexual fantasies when remembering their first kisses or caresses with a girl or boy who was the same age when they kissed or met? ... What happens to those who, being minors, had the pleasure and pleasure of being able to love their platonic loves in a real and reciprocal way or who had the pleasure of fulfilling their love and/or sexual fantasies in an emotionally intelligent, mature, reciprocal, respectful way, loving and/or authoritative without ever suffering violent sexual abuse?... What if a conglomerate of abusive and desperate people attacked a few individuals who had the opportunity to work formally as clerks, bankers or congressmen? A boy or girl can and could even violate or/and sexually abuse any adult through political acts, blackmail and extortion... I believe that even minors should always take responsibility for their acts and omissions. What happens to those who, being minors, had the pleasure and pleasure of being able to love their platonic loves in a real and reciprocal way or who had the pleasure of fulfilling their love and/or sexual fantasies in an emotionally intelligent, mature, reciprocal, respectful way, loving and/or authoritative without ever suffering violent sexual abuse?... What if a conglomerate of abusive and desperate people attacked a few individuals who had the opportunity to work formally as clerks, bankers or congressmen? A boy or girl can and could even violate or/and sexually abuse any adult through political acts, blackmail and extortion... I believe that even minors should always take responsibility for their acts and omissions.   I have known and seen cases where adults disguise themselves as children using certain types of body technology, I have also seen cases of adult individuals and dwarf adults who, to steal and impersonate children or minors, use technologies on their bodies to be able to see themselves. and to be able to function like children.  I also know of cases of minors who, because they are very responsible for their actions, may obtain official legal and governmental permissions to be treated as adults thanks to their individual and personal merits, and also thanks to their responsibility.   Although there are also completely opposite cases in which minors who commit a lot of crimes are sentenced to the death penalty. I believe that what should be investigated in a legal and fair manner is the adequate justice process to condemn sexual rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and, to a greater extent, sexual violation of defenseless individuals and persons, whether or not they are age minors. / []

The Duke of York had been caught strolling in Central Park with Epstein as well as peeking out the front door of his sprawling Upper East Side mansion — even though Epstein had already done jail time for sex with a minor.  “He went to see a friend to tell them he couldn’t be their friend any more,” the source insisted.  Still, the breakup did not appear too painful — with Andrew seen grinning happily as he waved goodbye to a female visitor to Epstein’s mansion, and his host throwing him a celebrity-packed party. Guests included Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Charlie Rose and George Stephanopoulos, The Post reported a few months later.  Authorities later found a “vast trove of lewd photographs” and child porn at the mansion where the British royal stayed.  NYP: Published Oct. 6, 2019 / []

I went to the Glastonbury festival once. & it rained. Standing at the main stage it was a hard slog to get up to the toilets. A lad in our group had a large rain slicker, a poncho, that covered his body completely. He drunkenly informed me that I was missing a trick & that he had figured out a way to beat the queues for the toilets. He then proceeded to urinate in a plastic bottle, under the cover of his poncho. He looked at me smugly, with great satisfaction as I watched his piss soak his bottom half completely & drench his shoes. This is the PR equivalent of that moment / []

Watching this again with the recent files that were released and one thing that is really telling, apart from the blatant lying, is that he doesn't once condemn or say how disgusted he is by Epstein's crimes. Guilty as sin but he will no doubt be protected by the powers that be. / []

LoLs the worst alibi I have heard in my entire life.lols You really need to go to the island to talk to Epstein.wow. It's like a Transformer 1 joke, I need to eat all the donuts because If I don't, they will think I'm guilty.lols A good joke.lols / []
He is a lying douchebag. / []
I wonder if he had the royal seal of approval on his shovel when doing this interview 😂😂 / []
Squirm  Andrew you  know you  done  wrong  Andrew is such à creepy person / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
I get sooo uncomfortable and embarrassed for him (Andrew), watching this disastrous interview 😅😂 / []
Biggest liar caught on video / []
Why don't you put this guy and all the others on a lie detector?   If he is innocent, that should speak in his behalf / []
If it's true that Epstein was a Mossad agent, then a lot becomes clear: his huge bank account and "friendship" with important public figures, some who held positions of trust. He must have had a lot of dirt on these people. This explains the Clinton's support for Netanyahu's war of occupation, territorial expansion and colonization of Palestine. Why do we even vote if instead of listening to voters politicians only listen to other country's intelligence and to lobbyists? The AIPAC, for example, is an extremely powerful lobby behind a lot of serious political decisions. / []
He's clearly lying / []
Nice double chin / []
U dollop / []
His girlfriend he can’t even say her name. Weird or what / []
I've watched this about 6 times,it just gets better and better 😂 / []
I've avoided watching this.  I knew it would be hard to watch.   I just can't. / ["The ads make this interview better.... I didn't even skip them."]
Guilty / []
That whole flight across the Atlantic to end a friendship could've been an email. / []
I believe every word he says. / []
I don’t know why they didn’t arrest him yet. He’s a pedophile. / []
Now, I am no body language expert. However, for every hard question asked, he either looks down or just so happens to close his eyes as he answers. / []
Well he didn’t have sex with a minor because he couldn’t sweat at the time case closed bois / []
Why he doesn't have a strong british accent? / []
"... no recollection whatsoever..."  *pays her off with Mummy's money.  Hmmmm / []
Let's give him some credit, at least he is not able to lie. 😅 / []
These upper class idiots have no idea about what its like to live in the real world... He has no skills for life at all as he doesn't live it in. He thinks he's untouchable but its like watching Blackadder !......Its a classic... / []
So descusting 😮😮😮 / []
This interview is gold. He remembered it was him in the picture but denied that it was actually taken. He shld have proven that it was fake by presenting the actual pic where they got it. / []
Watching this for the first time after Netflix came out with the docu. I wonder why he chose this interview instead of facing his allegations in court. I do not know him well but his stuttering bothered me (if this means something else). Anyway, I hope justice will deserved (to whoever deserves it). / []
The interviewer asked the right questions therefore Prince Andrew choked with lies / []
When he lies he stutter, use filler words and vocalized pauses. / []
UGH….” PHONEY BOLONEY “                              ( BOLOGNA ) / []
I can't fully remember, maybe someone here can help me, did Prince Charles get grilled this hard in the media and public about his long standing relationship with Jimmy Saville? / ['What do you mean ?']
Though I dislike Maitlis’ politics, her interviewing skills are simply unsurpassed…..Lovely, poised, intelligent—and with a voice that would melt butter ❤ / []
yes, I didn't sweat at the time. I OD'd on adrenaline.... / []
To be honest,those women are also disgusting and cunning. Some of them were not underage and knew exactly what are they doing.  Don't kiss and tell. I hate people who talk about their affairs. / ['“Affairs?!?” These were underage GIRLS.….38 of the “Jane Does” were aged 13 & 14. ALL came from dysfunctional homes. Save your judgementalism for situations you understand', '@Shineon83 actually,no! Listen to Piers Morgan on this. He confirmed that Andrew actually had relationship with a women who was not underage! He just didn\'t want to admit it because he doesn\'t want to admit the affair. I am not defending him,but i am sick of this "naive" and "weak" women narative (and i am not talking about underage girls) that are aaaalways the victims. Oh just stop it!', '@Shineon83 save your anger for your partner,loser']
Big idiot / []
It was honorable and the right thing to do staying at the house of a convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein while in NY🤭!!! The Royal Family  didn't have enough money or could afford for Andrew to stay in a hotel in New York while traveling in Business 😂🤣 This man should be in Jail is so SICK!!! / []
These perverted numb nuts . Not necessarily Andrew. Mainly Clinton , Epstein and Ghilsine. They are rich because of swindling. And they are bored and most are born psychopaths so they can think nothing better to do than rape and murder. They are like lesbians too. They F everything in the circle. Andrew had sex with   Ghislaine too right? Also , this one reporter I saw was like, “wouldn’t the cia know about this”,  well duh dumb ass.They are in on it too.  You can’t escape the matrix till the earliest 38. Others are enlightening younger tho. It is always gonna be like this. The matrix has already been programed. You are living in a VR program. Nuns priests are always gonna rape. Doctors. Schools. Medical institutions, Jails, insane asylums, Boys clubs, Boy Scout clubs, churches, royal family, government agencies All include 30 percent psychopath rapists. It was DONE by design. When are you all gonna get it?  Step dad , uncles, brothers , dads f’n everybody ( daughters and sons) all WRITTEN by design. Only .000001 percent of “humans” will be enlightened , that was done by design too. / []
This dude is lying through his teeth. Innocent people don’t come up with bizarre excuses…  his own family knew he was lying and removed him from the royal family . He should have owned it, or atleast stated that he met her and was with her but she’s using that as an inn to say they had relations.. if he had of owned meeting her while hanging out with jeffrey he could have convinced some people that she made up the sex part.. but his lies make it almost certain he was involved with her and probably many other young women. Funniest thing is it isn’t even illegal to sleep with a 17 year old in the UK / []
They must have been fist pumping after this interview? / []
What a fool to think he could explain away his perverted disgusting demeanor.  Just a worm...all the best at his reach and he decides to just stay a worm. I'll bet he sweating now knowing his predatory sexual perversions aren't going away. Piggy piggy piggy. / []
Bet where epstein stayed tested positive for illegal drugs / []
It’s the money that counts….. / []
What's been going on at the consul generals on 5th, should have the place drug tested / []
Such a pompous ass / []
😂😂😂😂 “oh that’s definitely me” 25:09 / []
He has no idea what an innocent person sounds like because he’s never been one. / []
statically talking this is bound to happen / []
Hummina Hummina Hummina / []
13:40 "No...she was Romanian". How could the interviewer not follow up on that "sweating" excuse"? Maybe best to just let it hang out there. / []
I love the way he says "Partied".  No better descriptive verb, eh? "When I was staying in his houses, there was absolutely no indication of child abuse going on and I was close up in there." You sure you want to go with that? What a disastrous interview. I'm surprised that the queen didn't have him drive through a tunnel after this. 8:50  Facepalm of the decade. / []
Wow this interview! Good job BBC! Both interesting and disgusting to watch... / []
😂 / []
He sees no problem with his friendship with Guilaine. He almost seems proud of it. Wow. / []
Since he’ve been convicted I stop talking to him!!! / []
Social média is now a problem that you have to face / []
No one gonna talk after jeferey murder !!!it’s like in a movie but for  real!!!!and the same as Putin, when she ask or talk about murder. Laugh like !!!!!because this is the reason nobody is going further!!!!! / []
A lie detector might help him recall. / []
I can’t recollect that photograph being taken isn’t the same as I was never there and did not meet Virginia Roberts. / []
What a disgrace to royalty / []
Nobody stays at a convicted sex offender’s house because it is a convenient place to stay Andrew. New York is full of hotels. / []
He only needed to spend 5 minutes on the phone in 2010 to tell him he couldn’t be in his company again. So Andrew then went to his house for a dinner party and stayed for several days! / []
What is it Buckingham Palace?  ….  Was is it even Prince Andrew ?  …. how can we trust anything to do with this interview !,   when there are no coasters under the water bottle or the drinks on the rosewood table …? / []
The royal family bringing shame to the people of UK / []
Oh how well this has aged. Is he in prison yet? / []
Not to him or anybody else !!!!a rich man dosent give away a couple millionième if they know they gonna win !!!!   And i i i i i i think of what not to say……. / []
Never trust a man who wears heavily skidded Calvin Classics boxer shorts .. / []
I believe him . . NOT !! / []
There is something seriously amiss here !    I cannot see a single coaster underneath either the waterbottle or the glasses. / ['So? It’s a cheap, little table. Andy doesn’t care', '@Shineon83  Yes of course… and quite appropriate for his cheap morals.', '😮….. Nice catch. Entitlement, y care if the table gets stained its replaceable 😌 unlike this interview']
Guy is innocent.  Look at his face. The monarchy is always so good to it's peasants. / []

Guilty as SIN / []
This aged well. :) / []
Speechless. / []
Prinz Peinlich! / []
You don't have to be an expert to see that this guy is lying during the whole interview. / []
I find it fascinating that he centers his answers to the accusations around his memory. “I don’t remember” “I’ve racked my brain and I cannot recall”  Ummm what? Hey a random person was murdered back in 2010. Did you kill them? “I can’t recall if I did or not 🤷‍♂️” / []
A very professional and impressive interview. However, the interviewee has convinced me that he is either a trustworthy nor an honorable man. / []
He is absolutely full of shit.. / []
Prince andrew , clinton and others did so many things people never know may be they killed jeffery epstein in jail / []
Liar pants  He said i break up with him in 2007 never contact him to that day  In 2010 he went to his home to celebrate of releaseness from jail / []
4:47 https://youtu.be/ZrDq_Ca_n1s / []
Certified scoundrel / []
Send this scumbag to the woodchipper along with anyone else who went to pedophile island / []
I love listening to this dope / []
One should write a transcript of all the lies!! “ I could not have had sex with a minor, because I do not know where a bar is at Trumps😮 / []
No, I don’t regret, because I learned a lot🤯 / []
Can they do this interview again lol He clearly sick. sad world / []
Any average person who isn’t elite and offended the way this monster did, would be tried to the full extent of the law and locked away. Rich and famous people just go on freely living. What a sick world we live in / ['Thats so real', 'Well, unless the rich and famous are not Democrats. \nTHose rich and famous sorts are well toast', 'Be there for your daughters they 😆🐿️', 'They are going to need you']
It is unbelievable that he is blaming social media for what’s going on with him. He wishes that good old times with paper newspapers be back and nobody would have ever revealed the dark side of his royal life. / ['….You caught that, too?  What a repulsive waste of resources.']
This guy should just keep his mouth shut because anything he says at this point only makes him look more bad. You were not close friends and yet you stayed at his houses many times and been to every party of his / []
How do you know if someone is lying?  They're going to make up stuff using their imagination. The person will try to add maximum stammers and specific details of the event, which a normal person who is telling truth would not notice, or even remember so well. 20:23 Listen to the details of the story carefully. There are so many pauses and specific details. Even the interviewer is suspicious. 😅 / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
Bro literally just thought ima waffle my way out of this 😂😭😭😭 / []
Going to Jeffrey’s was not about partying absolutely not 😭😂😂 my mans cooked / []
Favourite son of the former queen of the United Kingdom and Great Britain. The time has come for the British people to put an end to monarchy, the Royals are even more messed up than the rest of us. Epstein is a high profile pimp, he procures young girls for influential people and Andrew slept with one of them. / []
When he paid 12 mil of however much it was to the victim, he confirmed to the world hes guilty / []
😜🤪 / []
He stayed at the home of a convicted sex traffiker ( a big time one at that) and what he has come away with he is to honorable / []
He went to meet him to talk about covering his tracks and talk about being nonces! He is so protected in Windsor great park! Away from the public! This bloke is a total abuser that should be locked up. Nothing but a liar! / []
This royal "insect" doesn't need a trial, everyone who watched this interview knows: "HE DID IT !!!" / []
PARTY  PRINCE  TO A PERVERT  PRINCE  WHO SLEPT  WITH  YOUNG GIRLS   AND THE  QUEEN  PAID THE GIRL A LOT OF MONEY  SO IT WITH WOULD  GO AWAY  AND  ITS ALL CAME A BIT HIM ON THE  ARSE / []
Just shame on you  it's very difficult to believe what you are saying / []
Really bad hair day for Andrew, maybe he is sweating now, I do ask. / []
A masterclass into stammering your way through an interview. / []
In this interview Andrew has exposed himself as a rather delusional man totally disconnected from the real world. One can only feel pity for him, for having been brought up in an environment where you are being spoilt and privileged from the first day of your life. He has never known anything else than this strange reality of being a member of the Royal Family. I would have liked Maitlis to ask Andrew more about his private life. Since his divorce from Fergie, he has never had an official new girlfriend, let alone a new wife, which seems a bit odd, since that divorce took place 32 years ago. / ['Nope. Not an ounce of pity. ( I’ll save that for his victims )']
Don‘t they have experts in England to teach this guy how to talk during an interview?! Or some legal experts that would at least advise him not to incriminate himself like this?! Wow / []
He knew what he was doing. An educated man who only thought with his ****. He is aware of what the consequences were. He sought answers from Epstein when the court found out what the powerful men were doing on the run. In a way, I think the Royal House had Epstein killed so it looked like suicide. / []
Hahahhahahah what a joke ! He is such a bad Liar 🤣 / []
He went personally to see him and tell him “it is not appropriate to be seen with him”. This friendship stronger than anyone else thinks.  This man is a disgrace to the royal family, he cannot speak properly. People who advised him to do this should be in prison 😂 damn / []
I am wounded why she talking to him so soft and she treating him as he is a victim but imagine that was a Muslim guy in the same situation, she will barks at him and she will take the responsibility of the judge and tel him you guilty straight away. / ['Because she WANTED him to TALK — and not end the interview.….And I totally disagree with you. The REASON those Pakistani pedophile rings in the UK got away with their crimes for so long was because UK Police DIDN’T investigate them, or do their job']
She carried herself in a stoic way throughout the interview / []
He couldn't remember her because he met many like her, so he couldn't remember which one  exactly 😮 / []
Tendency to be too honourable. What a shit show / []
When i can’t sleep i come here   The comments are priceless! / []
Well done, Emily. / []
Birds of a feather… Show me your friend and I can tell who you are. This man is obviously lying through his teeth. / ['Exactly.']
This is an example on how to remove any doubt... dude didnt help himself with this interview. / []
your arm was around her in the photograph " yes " how do you explain that? " I cant " HAHAHAHAHAHAH DEADD / []
“A straight forward shooting weekend” lol only a wealthy person would say that, as in shooting ducks on an estate. / []
Emigrate to Australia. Go away grifter. / []
“ She is .. not confused about this , she said the first was in London when she was trafficked to you. The second was at Epsteins mantion in New York . “  The flashbacks are written on this dudes face . 😂😂😂😂 / []
I can't sweat 😂😂😂. His face tells it all. Guilty written all over it / ['Lol 😂😂😂']
I like to imagine that Prince Andrew walked away from this interview thinking he did amazing / []
😂🤡 / []
Maam i got this 😅 / []
4 days after docs unsealed, this video didn’t age well🤡🤡🤡 / []
Paedophile basta*rd stuttering his way through his lies. / []
LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. / []
Andrew is a pedophile.  The royal family is evil.  The queen is in a video being a part of a Pagan worship.  All  royals bow down to Lucifer.  Pure evil.  Charles is very evil, doing what is required of him by those trying to bring a New World Order.  William, also, may be someone against the people who value our freedom.  Trust nothing. / []
hahahhahhah he attended the parties because he wanted to know what was happening in the international business, Sirrrr don't you have people in the palace that can give you that information. / []
guilty button 👇 / []
Ask any interrogator that he show all signs of lying. Shakes his head and denied denied!! He has MI5 and best intelligences in the world / []
I remain convinced Dr.Jeffrey McDonald is innocent….what about analyzing one of his interviews? / []
Pure evil / []
I cannot believe this is real. My respects to the journalist, she was so profesional but, this man is just none sense. / []
Ben Shapiro is a sick, fascist, racist, masiognist, islanophobic, asshol who should not be given a playform. / []
Here is a guilty man. There’s is absolutely no doubt in my kind. The evidence is now stacked against him. The latest are the  orgies. Have you seen the interview with the police security concerning how many female visitors visited him and were not in any visitors list. This is a man that is pure scum. People in this country are very naive. The6 think they know the royals and everything about them. The6 talk posh so they’re aristocrats so can’t do wrong. All the staff at Buckingham palace hate Andrew.  You have absolutely no idea how much I hate this man. He should be in prison. Hate him and his family  The amount of money the British public spend for security alone for these scum is enough to abolish them. 2024 and we still have a royal family. Get a life people / []
Oh my goodness. I'm honestly embarrassed for him. He's clearly guilty and his body language and tone of voice aren't matching his lies. Although his answers are downright ridiculous and comical, it's still painful to.watch. / []
1st lie...He said he was delighted to talk.😂 / []
"it was a convenient place to stay" re: at a convicted pedophile's house. for real andrew?!?! / []
This is my 5th time watching this interview. Comedy gold. Apparently straight after the interview he took the whole BBC team for a guided tour of the palace then invited them all to stay for "movie night". He seemed to think the interview went well and they were all best friends now. / ['I imagine he was so proud of himself, because in his life this was probably one of the scariest moments, and having never have to develop longterm consequence thinking, him not being handcuffed straight after the interview registered in his sheltered little brain as a sign of success. So he felt like being the generous monarch in a celebratory fashion, gracing the plebs who witnessed him slaying his equivalent of Goliath, AKA getting a glimpse of reality.', '"NEXT STOP, DRUNKENNESS!" David Brent style.', '@Dekoherence-ii8pwHahaha! Nice one. “Never mind Pizza Express, how about Beer Express?!”', "Could it even be possibly acceptable to say he's probably neurologically impaired and that that is a viable reason (not excuse) for his socially inept behaviour? Just wondering..."]
Why it starts with a lie / []
I was believing all his BS. Until 11:17 ... / []
The hush money paid was stolen from the tax payer.. / []
Tendency to be to honorable..?😂😂 / []
This privileged sex predator is protected by the establishment and is paid a funded by the tax payer.. / []
Epstein was as welcome as Saville in the royal circles.. / []
if i ever found myself in a crowd of people and he was walking past everyone like some sort of royal publicity stunt - i would turn my back to him.  he doesn't deserve the value of my eyesight.  on a side note I just heard about the 72 stuffed animals on his bed and how his servants need to take photographic evidence of how they are positioned so that they can be replaced in the exact same position following a room clean. / []
Bald faced liar / []
Wish they hadn't settle on this case and this man can be cross-examined in the US with jury / []
What a truly despicable man. / []
I’m no royalist, in fact I think having a monarchy introduces a toxic class system allowing criminals like the majority of the house of lords, anyway yeah I’m no royalist but I think this guys just an idiot as opposed to malicious. He hung round weinstein just for the la di da contacts and all the bumbling in this interview is probably just to attempt to maintain a royal clean image / []
The way he's talking it clearly shows he's lying he's stressed not making eye contact and also bluffing a lot🤡 / []
I knew exactly what I was doing age 13 onwards.. The girl that got money out of him was 17 at that time! She knew exactly what she was doing.  Just saying it like it is!  He IS still our very much loved queens son, who has now had his name dragged through the mud. / ['….Time to retire, dear.', 'Way to tell everyone that you love child sex trafficking']
Yeah, this dumb dude is super spoiled and thinks he was untouchable. He needs to sit and listen to his dumb self. / []
If this guy isn’t guilty then guilt doesn’t exist! / ['Guilty of what, exactly? Having a dodgy friend? People are only interested because he is a royal, if he was just some Joe Soap nobody would even care. Maybe he had sex with a prostitute who wasn’t underage, so what?']
60 Minutes Australia’s Tara Brown should’ve taken him to task, “how long have you been a beady eyed pervert”…? / []
Nauseating liar / []
And this childlover is still free 🤷🏻‍♂️ / ["She wasn't a child", 'Still a free man 🤷🏻\u200d♂️']
It's been 2 years since i watched this for the first time. Watching it again now, Andrew himself has convinced me of his guilt / []
Why are some people born to this earth to be able to blatantly walk all over us mere mortals and still live a life of privalage / []
13:40 when she mentioned john brockman he was quite surprised. He was not expecting a betrayal apparently / ['It’s so funny 💀 his face that time is just extremely so so so funny']
It is clear that Andrew is inside the criminal ring, and the world wants to know who killed Jeffrey, and the Western world is ruled by some people from the people of Zion, and they treat humans like goods or sheep. / []
My biggest problem is that I am probably too honourable / []
Lest we forget the paedophile 'prince'....who still needs to be brought to justice ⚖️ 😠 / []
dont call him a man. He is nothing but a pedophile. / []
Saint Andrew 😇 / []
Funnily enough, for a man that uses funnily enough to pepper all his dull, poorly structured answers, he doesn't know how to correctly use the words funnily enough. / []
One word........ / []
How does he know that a photo of him was taken upstairs if his never been there? He remembered the dining table though? No recollection of the photo ? But the best one is i don't sweat..😅 / []
This guy makes me sick, a brat, a fool and a total liar. / []
Wow either he's an absolute idiot or he thinks we are idiots.  Did he really think that people will believe that he didn't know what was going on with Epstein when he invited him to the palace or stayed at his residences?  I wonder if he would agree to a lie detector test.  On the side, thanks to BBC News for making this interview. / []
"We (Royal Family) try to uphold the highest practices and standards."  Oh, that's a laugh. / ['The magic word is "try"', "@useyourbrain1232 wasn't trying very hard."]
This guy is unbelievable, talk about digging a whole, give him a bigger shovel, disgusting pig of a man / []
Donald Trump IS THE LOSER WHO ODIDNT WANT ANYONE TO BELIEV EIN A CHARLES AND DIANA OR AN ADNREW AND A SARAH OR ANY LOVE IN REALITY AND THE KIND OF GUY TO MUSCLE PRTEOCTION FOR PEOPLE AND THEN BLAME EVERYONE WHEN HE'S GUILTY, ITS HIS WISH THAT SEX TRAFFICKING GOES ON NOT PRINCE ANDREW OR Hillary Clinton.. such. shame that he was elected and made that a much money and people believe he believes in christianity. the only thing he believes in is using cocaine. / []
"Air Miles Andy" - who was recipient of government funds for his travel budget (which he used to MAXIMUM output at every opportunity he had) - stayed at Epstein's house "out of convenience". Absolute balderdash. Such a flimsy defense and it's laughable he has this kind of thrift - considering he settled this "frivolous and untrue" civil case out of court for £9 million. It is my belief that this man is lying. / []
The queen made a big mistake having sex on that night… / []
That kiddie F'r belongs in jail. / []

tendency to be too honorable / ["I didn't sweat at the time"]
Not him saying he had a medical condition that makes him NOT SWEAT! 😭🤣😂 / []
Good grief, what a disaster. Why on earth would a man of his stature have ZERO contact while Epstein was in jail (the friendship was obviously “done” and impossible—flat out impossible) and THEN meet with him AFTER release from jail, no contact, in order to stay at his home and have a “heart-to-heart” meeting breaking off a friendship that had been already obviously made impossible by Epstein’s jail term?!?!?! This man boggles the mind. Off to Froggy Cottage, Andy. / []
Having 2 daughters the same age, you should be ashamed of yourself. / []
If only pigs could fly .. shame ! / []
Recalls some things in detail, but conveniently cannot recall others. Contradicting, tripping himself up constantly all with an air of pompous, arrogant, entitled superiority / []
He had to go tell him in person because he had to tell him please Jeffery don't tell anyone I was involved don't tell about the sex I had .. then stay on 4 days in a row .. being the guest of honor at a pediphile's  party ! 🎉 oh no I'm not sure if I was the guest of honor was I ? But dinner was great  🤔it's really hard to watch because it's very obvious he's lying. / []
Omg 😂the constant blinking and closing his eyes while talking the head bobbing back and forth his whole body swiveling this way that way.. the touching of his face .. lying lying and more lying .. I could see right through .. just absolutely crazy him trying to be convincing.. the reasoning lol 😂 the sweat condition what a bizarre spectacle he made of himself liar liar pants blazing on fire 🔥 / []

He seems innocent to me. / []
LIAR / []
Jeffreys sex worker business is not the only sex business in America full of Brothels. That was big boys business and the owner is dead meaning the end of everything about what happened within jeffreys sex business.  May his soul continue to rest in peace. / []
A liar and a creep. / []
His responses and stupid ‘naive innocent’ faces of idk are infuriating / []
She was young and all of us can come across people who look like the one we know and mistake them with. Maybe she did mistake and guy realised her mistake and went with flow to get whatever he wants? Maybe?  I just wonder why so much judgement is thrown before even proving his guilt.  Doesn't seems to be fair or right. / ['So you’re saying he wanted to be with an underage girl? Exactly.', "@strnglhld nope. I am saying that she wanted to be with famous guy and possibly mistake him with his clone and went along with. \nJust to be clear, I am not having anyone sides, it's just some things in the way story was told make me feel really odd and that it wasn't what was really happen. \n\nI also via private life experience learned how much some people wanna destroy other person life just because they wanted. Here you don't need to be royal. I am not but experienced things like lies about me spreading around with no way to convince anyone to your side because for many lie was more attractive to talk about.", '@strnglhld also sorry if I lost somewhere right way of writing in English. Doing my best but I am not native to this language. I am self learning. Constructive criticism always welcome.', '@KainisDarc It was not her choice. She was trafficked by Epstein.']

"As far as I can see from the evidence, you're as guilty as a puppy sitting beside a pile of poo." / []
he lying, he like what jeffrey was doing with them young girls / []
An honorable person getting a last honorable body massage from an honorable russian lady inside an honorable mansion belonging to an honorable person who the honorable prince was meeting for the last honorable time. / []
this the greatest comedy special of all time . . . / []
He bought him to his daughters birthday party what a sick man / []
Geez he looks like death warmed up / []
ANDREW....'tonight shall I stay in the best hotel money can buy....or a sex offender's house....which shall it be....' ? / ['The best hotel money can buy AND the best looking women.']
It is January, 2024    -   so many provable lies.    From Ghislaine's deposition, flight records, telephone records  ... / []
Not a close friend ? Yea Right / []
"He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together..."   I would go to the dinner parties and meet academics, politicians, members of the UN......he just clued us into how far Epstein's reach went and how many people are pedofiles and disgusting sexist pigs.   It's laughable how stupid and condescending this man thinks the rest of us, that we can't put the dots together.  Arrogant pig having sex with girls who were the same age as his own children.  THAT is one sick, narcissistic f*ck and low life in a nice suit. / []
He contradicted himself numerous times, his eye movements, facial expressions and body language scream a liar!!!! Worse liar than P. T. / []
The sex being pleasurable comment kills me 😂 / []
the body language can't lie he is guilty / []
It was "inevitable" that he and Jeffrey would "come across each other".......I'd like to see THAT video.. / []
Been to the same training school as BoJo and Sunak “I can’t recollect” = I’m totally lying now / []
Freudian slip at 10:21. I hope this sniveling weasel gets charged with some crime!! / []
Classic example of a liar concentrating so hard on his lie that he forgets to add any corresponding natural body language of hand gestures etc - he’s having to forcibly over control himself. / []
Love it.. never been to this bar Tramps … never bought a drink for anyone WHEN I’ve been there…..😂😂😂 / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂happy new year your nonceness bet your sweating now 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Every time he mentions epsteins suicide he giggles, its like he cant contain his glee that epstein cant talk. Bill gates does exactly the same. 8m sure its a subconscious thing. / []
Theres a slight problem with the sweating 😂 / []
This aged well 🤣 / []
Bullroot / []
Pants on fire...! 🔥🔥🔥 / []
Scumbag / []
My favourite part was when he said how he was racking his brain trying to remember if he’d had sex with any girls there but definitely couldn’t remember doing it, and trying to forget an assertive act would be difficult. Who when they’re accused of something tries desperately to remember if it could’ve happened or not. You either know you did or know you didn’t.  Jaw dropping. / ['Plus, he remembers exactly, with all the details of March 10th 2001, 21 years before the interview, yet he "can\'t remember" having s*x with those girls. Idk but, someone remembering all the details of a date about 21 years ago would remember if he had sex with a minor girl 3 times. He\'s all in a paradox :)', 'One of the most fucked things he could ever do in his life.', 'his" having sex for a man is a positive act and people cant easily forget positive acts "argument was soo stupidd i played it back and listened for the second time if i understood it right. he probably said whatever came to his mind to give long answers but it backfired on him 😵😵😵', '@jovemmm789 yeah, if he’d just said “it didn’t happen”, it would’ve come across a lot better than all that forgetting positive acts stuff. The more he talked the worse it got. \n\nThe sweating, not remembering where the bar is, pizza express night decades ago, not remembering being upstairs for the photo, staying with Epstein for multiple days because he was honourable and wanted to break up the friendship in person…….. the whole thing is absolutely mind blowing.']
😂😂😂😂😂   What a 🤡 / []
Hello Britain, how are you? How are you feeling? I'm watching an interview with your king's brother, who was a friend of the slave trader. I think you understand why these people fly to Africa and what kind of “charity” they provide to the people of Africa. / []
Funny that his best defense line is saying that he was inviting Gelaine and not Epstein, when in fact she was just as guilty. / []
Who is surprised that Epstein suddenly died in prison? / ['Epstein himself', '@twoandimoff :))']
I'm an engagement person, I want to find out, I want to learn! From a pidofile? How would you feel if someone else was abusing your daughters? Unbelievable. / []
Epstein is alive don’t be a fool! / []
Not going to Jeffrey’s for partying, right, and then fly on Epstein’s plane to his orgy island; yep partying was never on this poor man’s mind. Andrew must think we’re all gullible, he is not the brightest light on the porch. / []
This pervert says that he has only been to Palm Beach 4 times in total right! Tracking flight logs would unveil through how many times he's actually been to this convenient place. / []
WWG1WGA Q Anons    White Hats Clearing the swamps of depravity   PRAISE OUR LORD ALMIGHTY GOD / []
He went to Epsteins house even after knowing because he thought he was untouchable. / ['Not so untouchable now. Andrew couldn’t even explain what opportunities he “was given to learn”… what business was he involved in… it’s all clap trap']
A cornered rat!! / []
This interview will haunt him more, especially now that the docs have been released. Will he ever be held accountable… / ['Will he bollocks. Money talks']
He’s as guilty today as he was back then / ['Haha.. I disagree, I think he’s even more guilty now than he’s ever been']
He sees nothing wrong with all of it & there will be no consequences. He's there gaslighting us like "yeah I'm an untouchable royal Prince & I'll do as I please" sums up the interview. Royalty is nonsense these people grow up out of touch with reality & immune from criminal charges!? How else will a so called "prince" be jailed? They are Gods & British people worship them no different from the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt. They'll cry about it but let it slide. / []
The truth will set him free !! Wether hes guilty or not ? It dnt pay my bills ! / []
Watching Randy Andy squirm like a worm is SO hilarious. I can't stop laughing at this entitled fool digging himself his own grave.  LOL   / []
If you watch his face and eyes when he is asked a difficult question you can clearly see the eyes glazing and the head sinking into his chest, its laughable the answers he’s giving, he distinctively remembers the odd non memorable things but anything else he has forgot, selective memory at its best! / []
OMG!!!  THIS JERK IS SO FULL OF SH1+!  IS HE SO DELUSIONAL THAT HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE ALL HIS LIES?  WHAT A PIECE OF SH1+! / []
Bill Clinton should do the same interview... / []
When you trying to deflect with your underwear round your ankles 😂 / []
anyone seen the interview from the security guard that looked after andrew? / []
liar liar pants on fire😂😂😂 Andrew is such a bad actor! Everyone can see through his lies😂Andrew's judgment is affected by the temptation of these young girls in Jeffrey's house 😂😂 Obviously,  as a prince, Andy has been abusing his privilege and power...and Jeffrey made use this connection, they both got their needs from this relationship! / []
We weren't very close friends at all. But I felt like I couldn't terminate the friendship over the phone so even though he was barely an acquaintance I flew halfway around the world to take a walk in the park with him.  I knew I should not be seen with him again so I made that clear by being seen with him. I terminated our friendship on the spot, and to show him I was serious we hung out for a further 4 days, including at least one dinner party. / ['Like, make it make sense !!!', 'dont forget the that picture was taken upstairs and i’ve never been upstairs in Ghislaine’s house….', 'A real man could handle stopping friendship on phone!', "Brilliant comment!  He was such a liar thru the whole thing.  He's so arrogant, and you can tell he was the Queen's favourite, and has been coddled his entire life.  He doesn't have a clue.", 'He knew he couldn’t risk being dropped in by the FBI']
🇬🇧🤥👑🏴‍☠️🦎 / []
He’s absolutely disgusting / []
Don't worry!! King Charles will never back or see the light of his brother again... / []
This was not an interview; this was a deposition.Why in the world would you do an interview only to incriminate yourself.  The interviewer did very well. I'm surprised he didn't terminate the interview.  Anyone who associates with Jeffrey Epstein and has been to his homes, his plane, his "Lolita" island knows exactly what's going on.  Period. / []
Thanks so much for posting. / ['Fr i had so much fun watching thag.. this man is sick']
Send him to prison / []
Guilty.. never forget this people. And dont think other member of this family dont engage in this behaviour. / []
This interview never get old. / []
They can't lie about this anymore / []
Royal family r disgusting people 2 cover this up / []
Not there 2 party, Nothing convinced u this was all going on tho u were in a photo with a young girl,,, so full of shit this guy is / ['Why do you write like that?']
Sounds like everyone had a good time / []
A guy who has lived in a narcissistic bubble all his life is held to account for the first time ever and has no idea how to deal with it / ['He was protected by his mommy for so long that he assumed that what real life was like.']
What a pile of codswallop!!!! He is an entitled POS! / []
My favourite part is where he said he had to go and see Epstein in person to say they cant be seen together, while being seen together. It was the Gentlemanly honorable thing to do. This would be hilarious if it didnt relate to something so serious.  Arrogant Prat thought he could handle this interview like a charm. / []
I’ll bet he slept with these girls why else would he settle with the victim / []
What a terrible man the ole Duke of York is!! It’s amazing how the color of his makeup changes throughout interview😂😂 / []
Why won't he call anyone a liar if his stories are true? I'd be saying it over and over ... liar! Rubbish ... tripe! Is that a legal thing? / []
It just gets worse!$12000000 and never met her.ass hole / []
He went there with the sole purpose of sex with minors / []
Well, those lies didn't age well / []
“youre blinking”   “well no i cant blink i have a medical condition its impossible for me to blink” / []
Sorry, and last, there is witness on the picture, who can confirm if picture is true or false / []
48:06 her face says it all. She’s disgusted with him just like the rest of us / []
I had to go 👀 him to tell him that it would inappropriate for us to be seen together. 😂 Maybe his tie is too tight. / []
I have few doubts about his picture with girl. 1st, we can see lighth in the window from camera flash, but not shadows on the wall. Perhaps at that time was not a phone camera, but just a photo camera with flash. It is night outside. 2nd - the hairs of girl at her left zide stack to the shirt, but on right side no hairs, which suppose to stack to the shirt of man. 3rd in the position he "hold" the girl his lect shoulder should be more up, lifted, but it is look like left hand straight down relaxed. Also girl seams be in movement by her left hand. / []
For me, it would have been a way better idea if he had admited that he actually had sex with that girl, but not knowing that she was 17, or if she was beeing payed by Epstein. Even from a juridical point of view, such mistake would have been unevitable unless he had asked her to see her ID, wich, in the world of such an spoiled 60 years old member of the royal family, as distanced of the real world as he is, seems nearly imposible. At last, people wouldn't think he is an idiot, maybe just a little pervert, but is a way more common thing to be between his pairs. / []
“Cuz it was a small villa party there were only 8-10 year olds there “ 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
He let Jeffrey come to his daughters 18th birthday party 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Hahahahaha the amount of times he lied / []
Por que tener que ir haberlo para  romper  una amistad..jummmm   Eso no lo  cree nadie.. / []
🤥🤥🤥🤥 / []
This has aged well.😅😢😂 / []
Absolute Moran! U can tell his lying. When u point fingers there’s 3 fingers pointing back at urself. / []
The best youtube video ever. To watch his downfall beautifully orchestrated by a wonderful woman and how he revealed how completely stupid he is. / []
The family of idiots) / []
Closing in on this creep / []
Watching this for the 5th time and his comment about “positive action” is now the weirdest part of this whole thing / []
I don’t know how she stayed that poised & calm. I would’ve given him the side eye, would’ve laughed my ass off, blown raspberries… idk. Professional interviewer. / []
Go to jail / []
"I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady"  And then there's a photo of them from years ago / []
One contradiction after the other. Endless lies . / []
Oh the hens have come home to roost / []
you can only imagine what these criminals have done in the past / []
He prob a part of the sex offenders club sick f###kers / []
And after that they criticize KSA without any evidence  for women right and your elite have sex with 14 and 15 years girls WTF / []
he saying he was close to his girlfriend not him like his girlfriend wasn't partaking in his crimes / []
I saw another interview where one of the victims said Andrew and Epstein would start to shake uncontrollably when new young flesh would walk through the door, she said it was something dark and sinister where they would literally just transform and manifest before your very eyes! / []
Has he never heard of ghosting a person? No, he had to show “leadership” to go tell him he wouldn’t see him. / ['That is so irritating to me, arggh, he disgusts me to say the least.. He had already succeeded in ghosting the guy for all these years, did not visit, call etc and still thinks he needs to go and talk to the guy face to face arggh, he thought ppl are so stupid I tell you']
I am an engaging person, I want to be able to engage. / []
He's not a very good liar. / []
an entitled perv, liar, arrogant jerk / []
Sicko / []
Doesn't sweat. Sounds legit. / []
Back again to this cringe video. Looking at this again. My Word. His whole body language and facial expressions say that this man is guilty. He can't even answer why he went and visited a convicted sex offender😅😢😅. Can I suggest that he may have been one himself. / ['u know he\'s guilty when all he could answer is "I can\'t recollect" or "I can\'t remember" to most questions', "That is the problem when you don't tell the truth you have to keep track of all the lies."]
"You could not spend time around epstein and not know, what's going on " she said it three times, his answer baffles me everytime, the extreme self obsessed thinking his stuttering words. Emily certainly know what questions hold the power of truth. / []
“You’ve peed on his private plane” / []
Lair / []
Guilty / []
16:00 yeah 😑 / []
The more he tried to deny these allegations the deeper he digged his grave. It would have been much simpler to deny everything that she said - it s her word against his. / []
He stutters when he lies … / []
He tried to use every excuse he could, and the interviewer was having none of it / []
Um / []
What a lot of crock ! A despicable character !!’ Jail and throw away the key …. / []
He is still out and free, thanks to the privileges given to him by a criminal family who should spend the rest of his life behind bars.   This person is a disgrace to his family and society, and the family/society that protects him is no different from the obsolete and unjust Arab sheikhdoms. / []
How did she not burst out laughing is mind blowing to me 😅😂  This man is a joke. And the worst part of it all is that I think he most likely left that interview feeling pretty good about himself. 😅😂  Tbh I blamed his mother and his father for not teaching him the value in being accountable in life. He is a spoiled arrogant brat. / []
This man if you can call him that,  Has such a dark side. An absolute liar who has no problem insulting our inteligence whilst still to this day commiting the same crimes just changing his locations. What a creepy person / []
Top-3 funniest things I've ever seen 1. Dumb and Dumber 2. The Naked Gun 3. This interview / []
This is a man who had no expectations he’d be interviewed by such a calmly strategic mind / ['I\'m sure he knew, he probs just thought "Oh, it\'s a woman....I\'m Royal...I\'m clever....I\'ll tie her in knots". This is what happens when ppl tell you that you\'re the greatest, the most intelligent person in the room. Over and over. You start to believe it. Unfortunately for him proper journalists do research and have the receipts (dates, times, places). Just like dumb criminals do in Police interviews, this guy just digs himself deeper in trouble every time he opens his mouth! Even the quote [when discussing Epstein\'s convictionsl] "...I shouldn\'t be seen with him..." \nNot shouldn\'t see him, shouldn\'t be seen with him. Tells you it all']
Bill Clinton will be watching this again in the comings as a primer ahead of media interest following recent developments / []
I watch this interview every couple of months. I order pizza, open a beer, make an evening out of it... still the most entertaining hour in the history of Youtube. / ['Me, too. I just wish I could order from Pizza Express...sigh! 😅', 'Imagine the original version of that photo coming out 😂', '@CatherineLee-kt8ky haha very good', 'I can only watch this once... too horrible!', 'I got Taco Bell and taking a few vodka shots and enjoying this putz digging his own grave. This man banged underage women and he gets no jail time!?']
Shut up full of BS ! At least own it after all these evidences! Don’t make Ass out of yourself ,  predator Prince! Definitely Princess Diana is laughing at your parents’ up bringing ! / []

When you're royalty why do you need to explain yourself they can't be friends with a Criminal a registered sex offender a pedophile?? / []
When he tries to explain how having sex is a positive action that would be memorable but he has no memory whatsoever of the allegations therefore it must've never happened 😂😂😂 what a clown 🤡 this interview couldn't have gone worse / []
"My judgment was colored by my tendency to be too honorable".......what a hero / ['That statement made Clinton\'s _"I did not have sexual relations with that woman"_ seem like a cast-iron Biblical truth.']
YOU ar in IT  You piece of💩💩💩💩 / []
scumbag / []
You were unaware the photo was being taken? You were posing for whoever took it! / []
How does Andrew like his whiskey? Thirteen years old and full of coke. / []
His body language, eyes, stammer indicates Royal lies. If this is how the British have been ruled by this house for 1000 years with tax payers paying for their living in luxury and in return lying to them. The Epstein papers now reveal his links conclusively to him. He has caused irreparable damage to the monarchy. King Charles may be the last king. God save the king.So sad that the Queen did not hold him to account when he was a young man  to prevent this tragedy later. / []
His Royal Rapist! / []
He destroyed the interviewer, ran circles around her. / []
If bullshit was a person. Prince Andrew would be it. / []
rapist liar / []
The thing is no one believes him. Shame on you Andrew. / []
I am an avid supporter of a constiutional  Britishmonarchy that is trimmed and responsive to the needs and wishes of the people, but Andrew's sexual peccadilloes  hide the fact that Andrew is not intelligent, a spoilt vainglorious fool, who can't smell,or see odure, even if it was in front of his face. He confuses hierarchical privilege as an unearned entiltlement, without question or understanding the modern media age and the fact that being the biggest sexually venal HRH toad is against the wishes of the people, who effectively decide on the future of the monarchy and give the institution legitimate assent, via parliament.Andrew is a witless dork, without any introspective analytic common sense, he needs to be relegated, contained and to apologise, clean the stink around his nose! What an aristocratic saddo, he needs to ride his horse off the proverbial cliff and die with was little honour he has, and appreciate women properly, beyond the inflated royal priapic ego!! He is the simmering fuse that will destroy the monarchy, amongst young urban people, who have no time for embedded privilege, and Charles has a petulant William without graces, a gurning Katherine, too afraid to stop her plasticated smiles, an exhausted Camilla who hated Diana, for all her faults and a perverted Andrew stropping about his rank, becuase he is so utterly stupid, No need for the Yeomen of The Guard, they need the Royal Psychological Surgeons - in - Waiting to treat them all, other than the Duke of Kent, the Duke of Gloucester and Princess Anne, they need rescuing from themselves before their abdication, ssy 20 to 30 years from now, if this rot goes on unchecked. / []
After a long day of work I come to this video to relax / []
Guff can’t be leaved either.  He shouldn’t have ended the lawsuit it by paying her.  Bad advice probably from the queen. / []
This is why the Queen never gave interviews!  How stupid of Andrew.  Your words do not match you voice tone and body language!  Do they teach the royals to lie from birth?  😢😢😢😢AND do you the public really think that the Queen didn't know what he was up to?  She had ALL the royals under surveillance their entire lives! / []
This man is Cray Cray / []
This is royalty??  🤣 Sheyster.  Peasants have better character. / []
So stupid this guy.... like a criminal Patrick Star. / []
The Queen protected him. He’s still ok / []
It’s like the ending to the movie Paths of Glory .  Except the Prince has volunteered willingly for the f-ring Squad 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 / []
i know it sounds crazy,  but i think he is being punished through guilt by association. i think he might genuinely be a little "green". i wish he would just call out the jewish blackmail network though. / []
Total lies,so obvious / []
Who would settle out of court for allegedly $12 million pounds for something that never, ever happened. 🤔 Because it obviously did.🤯 / []
Great interviewer. / []
You are so full of shit, Andrew! / []
Me pregunto por que accedió a dar esta entrevista!! 🤔 solito cavo su tumbo el muy idiot@ 😵‍💫😂😂 / []
You, Andrew are a cowardly liar.  You've had your own way all of your life.  You not only are a pathological liar, you are a bully, as well with never ever have had to take responsibilities of your actions.  A sad disgusting creature.  Shame on you. / []
Dudes a straight liar / []
You know when you’re about 11 and you’ve been caught lying by your mother and you come up with the most elaborate amount of bullshit and you genuinely think you’ve talked your way out of it…. / []
Not one word of sympathy or compassion for the victims. The word "psychopath" comes to mind. / []
Honestly flabbergasting that this was ever aired. I’m glad it was but it’s actually unbelievable that this was planned, recorded and released and not a leak. / ['Looks like a stitch up 😅']
First words, “there’s no good time to talk about Mr Epstein”. / []
Umm umm umm umm umm, i I I I I I I lmfaoooo guilty af / []
Thats why Stephen always was looking over his shoulder.... lol / []
I love how this nasty little boy talks about living up to honor.   He’s so full of himself.  He has to convince himself he’s a good little man … watch him flounder 😂 / []
It has to come out about all of them this year (2024) not just this awful man. He was best friends with Epstein for goodness like Prince Charles was best friends with Jimmy Saville! Who by the way had access to the palace 24/7 and would take young children there all the time. / []
this is a scumbag of the highest degree. / []
He look like he got the massage 💆 😅😅 / []
Can’t help wondering what his Mom(the Queen) thought about this scandal. / []
Guilty, simply based on his (tried) controlled behaviour. Such an entitled and awful person. Royal's are supposed to have the highest dignity and integrity as we are supposed to be and should be. The man is a liar, sex offender, a manipulator and child abuser. If it were anyone else, he would be rotting in a cell. I hope the new files expose all these people and justify all these perverts. / ['I agree with you 100%, this interview makes me sick.']
If this family of characters didn't exist, the British press would be out of business. / []
Gawd he’s lying through his Royal teeth 🙄🤢 / []
Coming back to this interview after the release of the names of the people who were involved in this case / []
Still one of the greatest interviews of all time. / []
Typical British establishment they think they can do what they want and lie to cover it up / []
Ah, explains it all doesn't it... / []
This interview reminds me of the little Britain sketch with the politicians 😂😂😂😂 / []
All that expensive education hasn't worked!!!! I wonder if it's inter breeding?Andrew wauld be the mad auntie in the attic   60 years ago. 🤯🤯🤯😱👋🇬🇧 / []

WHEN YOUR IN A HOLE STOP DIGGING. Andrew needs stop talking 😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
It's that time of year again... to sit back and rewarch 😂 / []
Prince andrew is a pedophile / []
Because of social media in the 21st-century “there’s a whole range of things we have to face.” It seems like he’s regretting he got caught! / []
He is so Honest respect 🙏 / []

This dude needs to get capped / []
did i just watch some person lying for 1 hour 😵 i wish he studied more / []
This guy lies with such a stone face which is enviable... / []
Watching again. At the (roughly) 29:53 mark, after she asks about the orgy, does it look like he has to stop himself looking smug? A kinda smirk? / ['Exactly']
How in the hell isn't this guy in jail. Holy shit. / []
I wonder why they ever agreed to do this interview lmao / ['I’d say the Queen cleverly made him do it.  There was too much heat on the institution and she made him publicly explain himself.  She stripped him of his titles afterwards.', '\u200b@GP-ni1kpAh fair enough, I never knew that. Cheers for explaining', '@GP-ni1kp no, I think he did not. it seems to be all on his own. you can see that on his tie, if this had been official, this would have not happened. plus that the palace would have stopped airing the interview.']
What a brilliant question.."I wonder what kind of effect this has had on your family?..you've got daughters of your own".. 41:15 / []
'He was in and out all over the place'  We know, Andrew. We know. / []
How does Prince Andrew like his whiskey..? 15 years old and full of coke. / []
"My judgment was colored by my tendency to be too honorable" - Prince Andrew. Holy shit, what a buffoon! Oh and btw, I want that line printed on a T-Shirt. / []

Are 100s of AIPAC/Epstein Honey Trap F I L M S coming soon? Modi??   Bibi, Donald, Joe, Zelensky, Barack,Hilary,Bill, GW,Dick, Bernie, RFK,  King Charles, several "royals', and 100s of others??!  West's Ruling Elite  have held power for centuries. They work thru AIPAC, Mossad, CIA,& MI6 and others who've been bought/bribed or blackmailed. They have trillions, are insanely selfish, have disappeared many revolutionary energy inventions that threatened their monopolies. They are behind the honey traps, endless wars, extreme corruption, Big Lies (propaganda) and eternal conflict. They intentionally keep the people divided, distracted & upset, so they/we won't see that they are the primary source of our troubles. <>!<>!<>The western Intel community could easily share damning evidence of ALL those involved in human trafficking. Why don't they? Ruling elite, via AIPAC bought them too! Traitors & cowards - but maybe not all? Hope springs eternally. Mass leaking, according to Julian Assange is the most effective way to fight corruption.<><> The view that  Epstein's murder ended the honey trap black mail ops is very naive. / ['awesome comment']
You're in the Epstein files. / []
It is never easy to interview those who think they are entitled, but through Maitlis’ skillful questioning and the interviewee's hubris, this PoS was brought to account. He might not have perspired while being shot at during the Falklands war, but I'm almost certain he was sweating during this interview. Talk about Dumb and Dummer! / []
What a train wreck. / []
This man is so Guilty even a blind person can see this. Our justice system is so messed up. What makes me even more upset is that Epstein took the cowards way out. Not to worry though, he is surely to have a grand time in hell. / []
I cannot sweat.... / []
Agreeing to do this interview was the worst decision / []
🔥 / []
How is this animal roaming the streets free / []
That stuff about 'positve action ' and racking his brain but juat can't recall encounter  etc. just does not ring true - its utterly not how one might act if you were a royal falsely accused of something  ..  youd no doubt be counter -suing..  a Massive guilty sign that he hasnt done so, with his bloody resources. / []
Guilty, Ang hopefully charge / []
He in an insufferable brat. He treated the staff terribly. He’s a horrible person at the core / []
If Andrew isn't guilty of what he's accused, then why did he pay the woman off? He's a liar and not a very good one, categorically! 🖕 / []
Global cult. / []
10:19 lmao pure gold! / []
January 2024 and this is still YouTube gold. / ['It’s the best 😂', 'Its just unbelievable 😂', 'I know 😂😂😂😂', 'I watch this interview every week', 'Watched this at least a dozen times.']
the one time bbc actually does an interview with deep state elites that isnt scripted and rigged. / []
This screams Michael Scott vibes 😂 / []
No mum it wasn't me / []
Watching this again 1/3/24 I cannot get past the fact that he tips and turns his head when he lies.  The phrase, “We must understand” and stuttering is a precursor to a lie.  And he NEVER denies having sex with anyone.  He only disputes when and where. / []
Gosh it’s a damn bugger isn’t it when one gets called oiout by one’s media ? Footman , another brandy hurry up you little oink I say !! / []
Looooong answers = L I A R / []
Amazing how everybody has so many excuses all of a sudden / []
“I can’t have sex, i didn’t even have a penis at the time” / ['LMFAO I CANT BREATHE💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣😭😭', '...but it grew back!']
Bruh this guy / []
Pervert nation! / []
"I'm an engaging person"....An arrogant, entitled man with zero self-awareness. Who would believe this nonsensical blather. / []
My big question isn't "why did he stay"  knowing Jeff's conviction. The question is what REASON he stayed. What webs were they spinning exactly! / []
she is an absolute soft spoken killler...the guilt he had lying to her for 49 min straight at the end he couldn,t even keep eye contact when she said "you royal highness thankyou for you time" / []
its clear he's laying / []
unbelievable choice of person to interview who clearly had no iclue - neither did the interviewer - nonsense questions terrible news - seriously bad...the reason the names hadnt been released at once? seriously are all te beebs legal dept on holiday - pathetic / ['are u retarded', 'Andrew, is this you?', "Found Andy's burner"]
Jeffrey Epstein, an American Jewish billionaire, was working for the Israeli Mossad, where he would invite high profile international figures whom the Mossad wanted to blackmail or recruit to his island in the US Virgin Islands, bring them underage girls to have sex with, and photograph these figures. The Israeli Mossad killed Jeffrey Estyn in prison so that he would not reveal any more secrets. Now I know why most of politicians can’t condam Israel for burning children in Gaza. / []
Emily Maitlis’ composure & calm interview style is excellent. / []
It's really interesting that people who lie get full.implosion and black karma ev entually with sickness death or other horrible things.... / []
Hey Genius aka Andrew, you don't have to 'look' for child abuse to see it. If a young girl is a a room with an older man, who is not her father, dressed scantily and for a long time, there is something wrong.   Brits, you hard earned tax payer money keeps this fool fed. / []
Definitely lieing 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
This still hits so hard! / []
100% INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY / ['Why are you weird.']
I think he had a lot of great times...will keep the secrets. / []
Lots of stuttering ....he is cautious on his answers / []
Um um um, sorry just trying to think of a lie / []
Barefaced & barefoot 🦶 Liar / []
Andrew is 100% guilty, look up "Peter Nygard" he was a fashion tycoon billionaire who lived in the Bahamas at "Nygard Cay" which is one of the largest and breathtaking multi-million dollar homes in the world he hosted "pamper parties" with minors which were being sex trafficked across Canada, USA, and the Bahamas.   Here, too, is where he entertains celebrities, from Prince Andrew to former U.S. president George Bush to Robert de Niro and neighbour Sean Connery. "I haven't been living life large enough, I reckon," said Oprah Winfrey after a stay. Peter Nygard need never worry about that.  Nygard is now in prison in Canada and still has to face allegations by a long list of "Jane Doe's" in the United States. / []
Your body language, the way you speak, and your face indicate that you are lying, you gay prince who loves underage girls / ["How is he gay & like girls?? The guy loves them too young. He isn't gay"]
Omg  he's not very bright 😂😂 he's PR team should be fired after that outrageous interview 😂 / []
what a career liar..😅 / []
What a scummy, disgusting, arrogant, better than the rest of us attitude prick he is. The Royal family knows about this and they just ignore and tried to glaze over it.  Can't stand it. / []
He really pumped out them 16 mark question answers bloody hell well done Andrew top mark loool dis guy could waffle his way through a literature exam / []
Car crash TV / []
Man’s a joke saying he’s innocent yet paid her off bare face liar / []
He says right at the beginning “I only saw him 2-3 times per year, yet the report states he was with Epstein 76 TIMES !!! Disgusting. / []
What a sicko. / []
This interview should have caused you more trouble than it did now all of this new information has come out I can imagine it will now,hopefully every single word you said will come back to fuck you up / []
Liar / []
Good marreid bye dont bother me / []
A cosmopolitan group of paedophiles / []
Unreal how he sits there and tells bold face lies. You know he’s dying inside. / []
Crook Andrew and pervert Epstein was butt hole buddies. / []
He must have got some tips from Bill Clinton before doing this interview / []
Eitelkeit, eindeutig meine Lieblingssünde! / []
He says he couldn't have been with the girl from the club because he was with his daughter taking her to a 'pizza' express LOL / ['That’s exactly the scene Im watching now and he’s so full of shit']
40:49 It's exactly what I tell my manager when he asks my how I'm doing and I sense have to defend my position in my company. / []
Let him do a lie detector test and you’ll see his ass in San Quentin the very next day / []
Someone here on January 4th 2024? 😁 / ['Yes honey he is horrible']
49:22 she’s looking at him like Maximus to Commodus in Gladiator in that szene: “Highness” / []
The more questions she raises, the more one can see that he's blatantly lying. He's too transparent. / []
This man was obviously thrown to the wolves by the palace. He could not have been less believable if he was high on meth. What a twitchy, sweaty coward. SAD for his mum. / []
Bad liar😮 / []
Such a disgrace to his late mother and father🤮 / []
Im just Glas everybody can See this Interview and the comment section is on i Männer just Listen to him! / []
He starts off saying he wasnt close friends but the reason he stayed with Jeffrey after his conviction was because he needed to say he couldn't see him anymore face to face  Jesus hes a fkn terrible liar / []
48:04 “he conducted himself in a manner unbecoming.” Nah, we know he be coming all the time. / ['cricket sounds']
He paid off Virginia 12 million pounds to stay silent … he better empty his piggy bank cuz more allegations are coming fr the court documents released today 😅 / []
The grand old Duke of York, he told 10,000 lies, he even went to Pizza Hut, so he would have an alibi. / []
And first prize goes to....so called Prince Andrew for telling the most lies in one interview... / []
Bet he would t do a lie detector test and not sweat either lol / []
Epstein brought the US "eminence" to prince Andrew, that was politicians, academics, etc., etc., but nevertheless, all those individuals are nothing more than Sex predators, Pedophiles, no matter their credentials, they sexually assaulted children, and some got away with that just because they're rich or because they are "the intelligent elite".  They're the lowest of the lowest. / []
She should have pulled that spitting image puppet out and said to him remember me! Simple Simon says touch your…… see his reaction better he would have been sweating then / []
You do nothing for anybody but yourself you disgraceful little boy.your demise will be celebrated.heres a badge for ya....sorry it looks like a Monkees ares whole 🤮🇳🇿 / []
This is sickening 🤮 / []

Jail time please / []
He doesn't remember groping her in the photo 😂 you scoundrel / []
What an absolute creep / []
Good lord you are a lying peice of shit / []
Filthy filthy pedi / []
He stammers like Joe Biden / []
I was best freinds with the pedou until I realized he had been snapped trading children / []
At one point she swallows her own vomit / []
Absolute predator with no brains. He comes across as a bit simple and 100 liar / []
This dude is an idiot. / []
Who else would of loved to be a fly on the wall while the queen watched this interview? No wonder she stripped him of his titles. Im taking it was  No sweat off his back 😂 / []
His blink rate and prolongued closing of eyes, eyes looking everywhere, lot's of deceptive head shaking when responding to allegations says different. If you didn't do it, why settle? / []
Emily  to me is nothing less then a lioness when she darkly asks “do you have any sense now for guilt , regret or shame about any of your behaviour in your friendship with Epstein “ / []
BBC complicit therefore as guilty as this man - BBC do not report - BBC are stenographers / []
hes never met her but pays her 7 million quid , he dont drink and party lol all over google now more stuffs come out 😂😂 / []
I think they need somebody else outside of British media to ask the hard questions he got away with it and he paid for that case God bless that young girl I hope she turns out okay in life / []
Prince Andrew said, “I never knew nothing was going on.” His words imply he knew. Either that, or his English is atrocious. / []
How would the Fool know it’s upstairs in Ghislaine’s house if he were never there?  Wouldn’t he say “I don’t recognize the setting”?😂😂😂 / []
you naughty naughty / []
Does the Royal Family not have Dental care?😮 / []
Here is Prince Offender, having Christmas lunch with the King (Charles treats Harry, Meghan and the kids like crap) and living in a mansion in Windsor park!!!    Now this Fool allegedly grabbed another young woman’s breasts😢  If he is so innocent, why won’t Andrew report to the FBI for questioning instead of hiding out?  I feel sorry for Bea and Eugenie. / []
Now ask yourself Andrew, was it all worth it?   Real judgement is still pending. / []
8:47.  Okay buddy / []
Who’s back to this interview now that the documents were released? / ['me', 'Yep', 'Me!', 'Me', 'And me']
..this absolute lying bag of "royal" shit is an example of the double standard..essentially above the law to a ridiculous degree... / []
When he said 4 times a year the way he said that hand me in tears 😂lmfao! What a creep! / []
Lock him up!! Lock him up!! This guy is guilty!! / []
The personification of guilty AF / []
LOL " I never went to Epstein for a party" - Yea we know why you went, it was a different type of party with underage kids. Pathetic Scum. / []
Amazingly! Good on her. / []
Wait, so you stay at the houses and the private island of some random woman’s partner, a woman who is barely a friend? 😂 / []
How does he know it's upstairs? If he "never went upstairs"? / []
I’m curious whether he stutters in other interviews. 🤔 What a complete crock of crap about the picture with Virginia-really? 🙄 / []
He should be locked up / []
at 28:00, this creep got real weird / []
What a liar this guy is. A grown man with his hand around a teenager on Epstein's Island. Sure..yeah.. like he didn't know what was going on / []
Praise be Her Majesty did not live to witness the Epstein List. RIP. ❤ / ['She asked for it not to be released']
If he’d had a smack up the chops the first time he’d told a maid to F off as a child he wouldn’t be half the prick he is now / []
And Santa Clause exist / []
Too honourable 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
To Mr Epstein - just Rest In Peace... / []
Gislaine Maxwell is in jail right now, I wonder who’s the new friend of Andy who provides him massages!?!? A 🐷 doesn’t stop easily! / []
The whole Virginia's story is a fake. British royalties have enough country estates to hold intimate meetings if necessary. It is insane to believe the whole racketeering story.  Celebrities are often sued just to take money from them. / ['Sheep', 'Sheep could be applied to someone who gazes at royals from its pastureland feeling sorry she will never be in the royal bedroom.

Let "underage girls" stay with their parents. It is their parents to blame, not the notorious "sex offenders". / []
Somehow I absolutely trust Prince Andrew. I hope there will soon be a return of the Duke of Yorkshire to the royal family in full bloom. In his face I see a man of duty and honour, a great ex-husband who has remained a friend of Sarah's and a great father for Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.  Moreover, fathers of daughters are not usually prone to sexual  relationships with underage girls because they always have in mind that can happen to their own children. / ['Delete ur account please', '\u200b@swav3r she is one of this crazy fan girls 😂', 'Ah, understandable... lol...']
How was it a convenient place to stay??  A hidden island that no one really knew about, that trafficked children… he deserves to be rotting in jail or in h3ll. / []
This men is absolute idiot and he has the IQ of a banana 🍌 😂 / []
This is amazing. This interviewer deserves a prize for the way she carried this interview. Every answer is evasive, I don’t know, trying to justify…digging such a deep hole. Just amazing to witness / ['Guess what? She actually did win several awards for this interview! 😊', "@CrimsonLegacy She had this all planned out.  She knew she couldn't be too accusing, but also wanted answers to things that the public were all asking.  She said she knew she would only have one shot at this, so she researched everything she could find about Andrew and his cronies.

Lying little weasel / []
OK, the prince has a crooked tie lol and he says it was because of Epstein's girlfriend that he knew him she was just as nasty as Epstein so lie after lie of course...LOL he just told on himself, he said I don't know where that's at(the bar) then he said he never bought a drink when he was there jeez dude you should have just kept your mouth shut... / []
Just shows you how delusional and disgusting the rich are , i would never speak ever to a friend who was convicted as a sex offender , to even go to tell them im not your friend would never happen , id end up punching that parson out , who gives someone the respect of breaking off a relationship thats a raping monster ,,,wow money , the root of evil , dont want to loose my status,  better go talk to my disgusting friends after the fact ,,,wow ..... / []
Abuser with privilege.. makes me sick. / []
He makes everything worse just by speaking 😂😂 / []
His demeanor and reactions are exposing himself as a liar / []
How convenient that he can sweat now, but "didn't sweat at the time." / []
He could have stayed in a posh hotel and not in Epstrin place. / []
He was atuttering... / []
"I have no recollection of this lady," is not "It didn't happen. I do not engage in s3x with minors." / []
Jesus the Sweating is so funny and Stupid what a horrible Liar / []
It’s true I met Andrew at pizza express over a stuffed crust and a Pepsi max  so leave him alone 😂 / []
i ddidnt think she would be allowed to merk a fellow jew / []
This guy believes he’s above the law because he’s a prince / []
Me thinks he doth protest too much... / []
He didn’t have a clue yet he’s surrounded by highly educated people… right / []
he "never went out and partied"?? REALLY, Randy Andy?? this is what you wanna be lying about when Jesus comes?? There's LITERALLY photos every.where. / []
He’s pathetic / []
Basically, It just costs the tax payer money if any of the tax I pay goes to this shithouse then i demand a full refund.  F-off and believe your own LIES / ['Your royal hindrance hehehe']
Can't even explain what he actually does / []
It's an  absolute  shit show and confession about his "teams " work to try and make him look innocent.  The interview makes you look stupid.   Oh yeah you carry on doing whatever it is you do?????  Actually what do you do??? Other than underage girls? / []
Guilty on all charges.  A hopeless lier / []
I don't believe a word he says / []
See Emily play... / []
Notorious peadophile lord mountbatten (prince philips mentor) introduced jimmy saville into the inner core of the royal family, andrew included.MI6 knew about saville, in fact he`d been questioned and released numerous times, yet they didnt think it necessary to warn the royal family about him when introduced into the heart of the monarchy ? if it was you or i, every stone would be turned to make sure there was not a single skeleton in our closet that could pose a threat to these wealthy elite.Prince charles was a close friend of vile, odd looking, ageing disc jockey monumental peadophile, necrophile, satanist and child trafficker jimmy saville and helped bury the claims against him. why would he do that ?  he was protected because he was a freemason, a member of the order of the garter and a satanist. saville was close friends with margaret thatcher (to the point he had a direct phone line to her home/offices) at the same time a massive peadophile ring was active in her government).MI6 didnt warn margaret ? of course they knew!! they were looking after their own. no doubt saville was supplying children to all of them andrew included no doubt. The media mentions saville was a monumental peadophile/satanist and supplier of children to the wealthy elite, yet they stop there and never mention who he was supplying them to! it doesnt take to much thought to figure out who...the royal family are a facade, hiding a darker evil...and andrew is up to his neck in it! then there the ties of ghislaine maxwell and jeffery epstein with the monarchy. the plot thickens... / []
Shown up for what he is / []
Radio tech was used as a conquer salon and the ROYAL FAMILY IS NOT TAKING THE BLAME FOR SLAVE NATZI TECH THAT IS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD / []
Also he's a terrible liar / []
It's good that the epstein files will be unsealed this week so they can arrest them all / []
He’s full of shit. I used to like him.  He’s just another rich user / []
yes .. is it honourable to rat out after the accused is Dead ... and you want the world people to believe you know nothing of one your stopp over homes from your mate Epstein ...    why would he kill himself ...  did you guyz take care of that so you could talk now ...  I am practising journalist. xx   Can you take a lie detector... / []
The best education produces this...the horror / []
How about those human hunting parties? Know anything about those your majesty? / []
Awww, poor little "RANDY ANDY". 🙄 The pathetic, little turd was wrongfully accused... wait, accused of the things he actually did. 🤨 Not even a good liar. (💩😈🤡) / []
Asking the same question so repeatedly does nothing to bring credit to the claims against Andrew. Just more of the same rubbish interview style we saw against Jordan Peterson. / []
He’s full of shit / []
The fact that he paid Virginia Roberts to settle the case proves that he is guilty even more 😂 / []
The amount of thinking he's having to do in order to answer every question says it all. / []
We have half a million people with a badge saying thank God I never met that Andrew bloke. / []
He's a "constant drip in the background". He's a spoofer. / []
I can't believe how much footage there is of Trump hanging out with Epstein and yet Republicans think he knew nothing and didn't partake in these awful activities. / []
He laughs through the word "Yes" when its said Epstein is dead. / []
I cannot sweat but apparently I can still piss myself, which is most unfortunate as this interview progresses. / []
"He had this extraordinary skill to bring these people together"  We all know what thats called 💀 / []
"why have you decided to talk now?" Because Epstein is dead and he cannot drop me in it. / []
Haha, such a liar, so obvious he's guilty. / []
Unreal that he thinks he’s fooling anyone / []
This vile creature needs outting behind bars . He is as guilty as sin and hides behind privilege . To treat his mother this wayvis disgusting. / []
This guy is such a privileged ass, protected and decides to ignore crimes against humanity which is typical,of people in royalty. Stopped communicating in2006 and then returns to a known pedophile in 2010?? / []
wow.......ive just watched this again after a coupla years and it still blows me away...what a disgusting invdividual...psychotically self absorbed reprobate who should be in the slammer for life.. / []
how did he know the photo graph was taken upstairs / []
He wasn’t that much of a friend according to Andrew , only through the other deviant maxwell , not close only met him a few times. So why then go and spend time with him to break up ? / []
He’s a liar you can tell / []
The Presence of "young girls" is not a criminal offence, they need to be able to prove those girls are being sold, rented, used, abused.. etc.. if they cannot prove this.. then it's purely circumstantial... it is safe to say that Andrew, like his brothers is abit of a dunce.. our royals aren't that bright, esp on the male side of the family.. but that is not evidence of wrong doing.  I need to see actual evidence before I will judge a Hero of our country.  Dancing with a 17 yr old or even having sex with her, is not a crime.  And without witnesses, there will never be enough evidence to prove it as he denies it.  Doesn't matter if she made 1 legal dep or 100.. if she is lying. She is still a liar. And without evidence to prove she's telling the truth, I can only judge that she is a gold digger liar.  It might even have been Epsteins intention to create this false situation, just to blackmail Andrew.  Just as he tried with the others. / []
rot in hell / []
Vital job when he was billionnaire. / []
Dumb enough to think he is smart. / ['Dunning - kruger']
I flew over 3800 hours in the Navy, and in my aviation physiology training, I never heard about an “overdose of Adrenaline?” He is a pathological liar… / []
He is a sexual pervert joke that NO ONE is laughing at. His interview is telling us nothing. NOTHING. WHY? / []
Whenever I feel depressed, I watch this interview. Always brightens my day 😂 / ['Lol when ever i watch this i find it more depressing,,,,rich doing what ever they want with no consequence  .....gross , they are in power and you feel better about your self wow ...', 'me too . its comedy gold', 'As "good" as it is, you really should find another hobby...', 'lol me too.', "This was difficult for him....I'm shocked he can still get out of his palace. This is too embarrassing"]
I don't understand why he had to explain the sweating make him look even more guilty. / ["Because she said he was sweating profusely in the nightclub, he thinks by saying he can't sweat exonerated him."]
And its on video for eternity,for all of us to watch for years to come. / []
He is so disgusting can you imagine what this girl went through. Having this man on top of you. Horrific / ['Look at his teeth!   You know his breath smells like 💩💩💩', 'With his sweaty red cheeks and heavy breathing', "He was even given the name Randy Andy in the 80's!", 'She was willingly working as a prostitute, that’s what they do.', 'ikr?  I remember those days, and that was his name in the papers!  "Randy Andy"!!  Then when he got married and chose Fergie, people were shocked.  They expected him to have a much younger bimbo.  He\'s my age, so I remember his history well!!@thehealthjunkie8996']
13:40 / []
Royal Highness😂 ???ROYAL LOWNESS . / []
So why did he have his mother pay 13 million pounds sterling for someone he did not know? / []
I also had an overdose of adrenilin and I still sweat. They should get him on the treadmill and see what happens. / ["There's pictures of him comming out of a nightclub with heavy sweat marks under his armpits"]
You’re a partier!  You are in trouble now with your  royal family! It’s all coming out now. There’s a larger and deeper involvement you had with Epstein! You know that we have been asking for this info and you had every opportunity to provide it , yet you did not. Now the wrath comes down on you ! Yes you, Andrew! The title “Prince” does not belong to you any longer. You don’t deserve it. Child Molester,  child trafficking , child abuse… you could have come forward yet you chose not to! It’s a relationship that was INAPPROPRIATE from the start. Yet you stayed in his mansions! You are scum. Keep your hands off children! / []
Finally after 3+ years ago! We’ve asked for this several times !!! / []
Your own mother disowned you ...horrible peado / []
I can understand Charles not coming anywhere near him BUT………the whole time I was expecting Anne or at least Edward walking in and putting there hand 🤚 over his mouth. And yank him out if there 😂. Basically put him out of his misery / []
Never mind Andrew anymore .. when is the list of the other famous sick fucks coming out 😏 / []
He had a unique way of bringing  interesting high class people together !yes,it’s called  blackmail / []
That was an absolute trainwreck 😂 / []
IN LINE FOR THE CROWN 👑 It is far better to have no child than having like these pigs. 🐷 / []
Up shit creek without a paddle / []
Why doesn't he just say no comment 🤔 / []
Why would you have been thinking about it so much if you claim you knew nothing about it / []
Lie detector will reveal all is this completely false / ['The fact that he paid the girl enormous amounts of money proves his guilt.', "@carmenbrown3437\xa0 he doesn't know me do you think he'll give me 12m met up at pizza express lol 😆"]
If I was him I wouldn’t pay that American sl*t a penny. / []
The way he speaks at the end about the ‘going the same direction’ etc etc is so confident compared to the rest of the interview that was full of stuttering and spluttering…. Dead giveaway for, at the very least, misremembering or falsifying the memory/story. / []
6:25 to 6:55 He is guilty without any punishment or regret ... / []
I feel so sorry for Prince Andrew, oh why was he cursed with being too honourable 😢 / ['😢']
This witch-hunt for the man who should have been king is disgraceful! / []
He’s not a good liar. I’ve heard he treats his staff poorly. Watching this, I am SO glad I’m not him. Good job from the interviewer. / []
Deposition at its best.🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
Making over emphasised facial expressions usual indicate not being honest or sympathetic. / []
Her questions are brilliant, good for her. What a pig this guy. / []
I like Emily. She’s great at her job. / []
Ebstein saw the gullible brat coming. / []
so embarrassing / []
It's funny how you can have a health condition and not name it as most people when they get diagnosed with something it's ingrained in your mind that you know the name of it.  So him trying to say he's not able to sweat (hyperhidrosis) is a complete lie.  So many times during this interview it's obvious that he's lying, he dug his own grave yet 4 years on it seems he's gotten away with it with just an agreed settlement out of court. He should have been publicly shamed, walked through a town square in rough garments and have things thrown at him like rotten vegetables and manure then locked in an old-fashioned Victorian cell and throw away the key. / []
The photo proves him wrong. It’s upstairs in maxwells house with a 17 year old girl with Epstein taking the photo . He had sex with her and the out of court payment to keep her quite says everything / []
“I have no recollection of ever meeting her….but actually I remember getting and pizza in working with my daughter at 5pm on that exact date…..lock him up for god sake 😂😂 / []
This guy is a sociopath / []
The interviewer asks him are you saying you don't believe her she's lying and his response is thats a very difficult thing to answer. / []
He's absolutely sure that it is him in the photo with the young woman,but he's not sure if its his hand around here waste. I wonder what the interviewer must be thinking as she listens to this peice of garbage lie. / []
Convenient place to stay 🤣🤣🤣 / []
This liar. This damn liar,lying through his teeth. / []
Staying at the house of a convicted sex offender was a convenient place to stay those words from the mouth of lying Andrew is disgusting who sat and lied through that whole interview. His ass should be in prison,his hands is dirty not clean. / []
Peter File? This is the last call for a Peter File... / []
liarrrrr / []
why did he have to come to America 2 or 3 times a year .........? / []
He thinks he is so special… because he is “Royal”… and he thinks he can use his fluff to make himself believable and not questionable.  A con man disguised as someone “honorable”… just because he is part of the Royal family.  He makes me sick. / []
This guy got masterfully manipulated by a construct of the US secret services. / []
He is so guilty you can tell he's talking s""t / []
He is as thick as sh-t, one wonders about the blood line, are they all as thick as him . / []
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Youtube is complicit , if u post anything critical of Prince Andrew or the family you will be censored. THis is not a left/right issue. It's a moral issue / []
I love the look on his face when he remembers those seven girls on the island! / []
The slowest train wreck ever captured on film. / []
"That photo of me and her was taken upstairs.. ive never been upstairs"😂  I dont recall it happening. You either did or you DIDNT!  Guilty. Hes a pedophile. / []
I think the saddest thing is that this crazy white man believes himself 😮..is this what they thought when they colonised us all??? / []
God's judgment will eventually settle things! / []
The explanations he gives haha. Like holy / []
Lol the more this is watched the more lies you hear / []
Such a terrible lier lol / []
The look on his face when she says you were seen getting a foot massage from a young Russian girl is absolutely priceless,He wasn’t expecting that and he looked so guilty and lied through his teeth….. / []

“I don’t sweat”….😂😂😂  I bet he is sweating now though?….the list is going to be revealed in the next few days Andrew.  Also, “Do you regret the friendship with Epstein?”  Andrew “Well…no” I’m sorry, but if he had nothing to hide, he would have said “Absolutely” straight away.  Squeaky bum time for Andrew now… / []
he is such a bad actor, is laughable. The fast movements of the head, the eyebrow's raised quickly and the multiple  "No,no,no,no's". oh boy.... / []
Does the Prince expect us to believe that he wasn’t at Epstein’s home to meet/sleep with under age girls? LMFAO! / []
Oh No No No, just a ordinary run of the mill everyday  shooting  weekend, without pizza massage and sweat. What a great Bloke. Fergie is so So luckey to have guy like that. / []
Doesn't it enrage the British people to be supporting these lazy perverted GREEDY LEECHES?  It must cost million$ of pounds per day. Do they really need a royal leeching family? / []
"A cosmopolitan group of eminent pedos", says Andrew / []
I don't think this is the car crash I expected from the reaction in the media. Some of what he says make sense - like Epstein nor parading his paedophilia in front of a member of the Royal Family but the stuff about not sweating and being too honourable is laughable. / []
I believe him. / []
It's not so much that prince Andrew was at fault, but the security service around the royal family they are there to protect the royals it was up to them to make sure that the people Prince Andrew mixed in with was honourable just like any other member of the royal family it is not uncommon  that many people would want to make friendships with members of the royal family Prince Andrew is no different,, Prince Andrew over the years as always been a good looking guy and I can say that because I'm gay,.... But I am not a royalist.. But I don't believe in people causing problems when there is nothing there ,, I hope the security service will do a better job looking after the royals in future... / []
He has no honour! Shameful! Arrogance! / []
Just imagine the tons of skeletons influential rich powerful people that we don’t even know about have hidden! The devil gives you fame money power but he gives with one hand and takes with both he takes your soul dignity and morals you become worst than an animal / []
Wonderful / []
Just by listening to this...he is quite guilty. That's just what his actions give the vibe of. Again why does everybody ALWAYS laugh when they talk about him being dead. / []
Andrew deserves everything he got!!😂😂 / []
If I have a flaw, it's that I'm 'too honorable'."With all due respect, are you lying to my face?" To your face? I don't think so. / []
Ask him what he'd do if an old man had s e x w his 18yr old daughter / ['He would probably watch or join in.']
What are we gonna do when his DNA shows up on one of her dresses / []

Hard to call him a liar cause, truth ...it was the WRONG thing to go stay w him after his convention  What a hustler!!!! / []

Shame on you,and you call yourself a father,prison for all of them ,this guys fuck little girls with tax money / []

He had Epstein kilted so he could not testify against him just like they did with princess Dianna. Royal trailer park trash / []
Put this maggot fool down ? He is not going to jail for his crimes as Royals buy their way out of everything.  Step up  jihad & rid the world of this fool ? You will be supported. / []
Lord have mercy 😢!!!   People , if you tell the truth you don't have to be a good lier. All you need to do tell the truth and beg forgiveness.  People are more likely to be compassionate.  This was terrible, the poor Queen. Rest in peace ma.😮 / []
HOW IS THIS MAN STILL A FREE MAN. Lock him up. / []
a sex predator and a rapist can tell his lies on a public channel and then his now ceased mothers paid 10m just to avoid a well deserved jail term. Is it normal that criminals get an hour on bbc to tell lies? / []
it is a good time to watch this again... i am very impressed with the saying like "I went to see him to tell him it was inappropriate for us to be seen together." / []
I never saw uncle andy at any of these places.. but trump was there. / []
😂😂😂 / []
Got him REALLY GOOD at the Queen B*tch the Seconds funeral…unfortunately those whom felt compassion for LizBeth II stopped the damming honest evidence shouted allowed… / []
I don’t believe he would be dumb enough to let somebody take that picture so it might be fake but I don’t know who to believe the victim is getting rich so she could be motivated by money who knows we’ll never know the truth. / []

Has anyone else seen that subsequent interview with the British Masseur? A professional licenced massage therapist, NOT a sex worker, who described her experience with the 'Prince of Sleaze'?  She said she was dismayed to find on entering the room that he'd dispensed with any underwear or the available 'modesty covering' sheet, and after she'd commenced the massage and was turning away for a moment, he randomly, right 'out of the blue', asked "Did she like to take it up the A?"!!!  and she nearly fell over with shock. / []
Great God Almighty!  Could ANYONE have done a better hatchet job on his own { whatever shreds remained of it! }  credibility than this man himself?  His 'minders' must have been wandering about looking for brick walls to bash their heads against...   Did the Queen see this?  And still chose to believe that Son no. 2 was just 'a bit thick'!?  Poor woman, to have to deal with this - and then the Harry / Mexit BPD debacle - in her 90's... And he's still there - and with his snout still in the public purse? Charles is trying to delicately navigate around and over this travelling train wreck, but I get the strong impression that Wills, once in place, will slice though / excise this dead weight like a scalpel. Which is precisely the right thing to do and long overdue. / []

He is a Narcissistic Sociopathic Pedophile. And he thought by doing this interview so candidly that he would be able to convince the whole world that he was oblivious and innocent to any wrong doing when in fact he just dug his own hole and literally showed the whole world that he indeed is that bold face lying Narcissistic Pedophile. SICKENING!!! She was fantastic though!!! / ["That's probably not it. I don't believe people at his level are stupid enough to be that delusional. I think what's happened is the entire royal family is just as guilty as he is. He's a lesser known, less popular figure so they're throwing his face to the world. Some action needed to be taken, he's a sacrificial lamb and he knows it.", 'So right!']

why isn't trump being interrogated about this? didn't he live next to him in Florida? / ["Actually Trump cut him off after Epstein's 2008 Arrest. However, I think you mean Bill Clinton.

Defund both these outdated institutions! 👎 Archaic nonsense! / []
I think the ability blow smoke in commoners faces is bred into being “Royal”. Andrew had backup smoke machines on set! Fire alarms were going off all over the US and Britain after this one! Will Epstein’s little black book ever be revealed? Strange how the story went behind the curtains after Epstein conveniently ‘killed himself’. Shooting weekend my ass. What a bald faced liar! You didn’t “walk in the park” w Epstein to kiss goodbye. It was to beg him not to spill the beans (after one last party!). Too honorable my ass. 🥱 / ['Gawd. He sounds like a polished Trump.']
What a masterclass in interviewing technique by Emily Maitlis. Pose the facts, maintain eye contact, let him trip over himself, contradict himself, and tie himself in knots trying to project false concern and shock. He's not 'kicking himself' for staying with a convicted sex offender and partaking in sex with a 17 year old, he's kicking himself for being caught. And buries himself in the final sentence too, 'you've dragged it all out'. An innocent man wouldn't use 'drag it out', as it implies uncomfortable truths have been revealed. / []
To all the royal sycophants posting support for Andrew please explain why the multimillion dollar settlement if he is innocent? I won’t hold my breath waiting for a response! / []

Let me just tell you he didn't kill himself he was killed because he's a loser a man like that wouldn't kill himself because a so-called man like that is a narcissist a narcissist or not going to kill themselves / []

His very last interview wonder what he's up to these days he's probably picking the dog shit up now and mucking out the horses because he's got fk all else to do no more public engagements again he must be climbing the walls with boredom he's basically now in his guilded jail for the rest of his life big time / []
Uhuhuh.umumum  Andrew did what he did with a underage girl  He is far from honorable / []
He is nots truthful at sll / []
What a joke nothing but lies and bullshitting in this interview . These rich and powerful people like him could murder 3 teen girls on live tv and get away with it and they would tell u s we didn t see that what we saw was him trying to help the girls after they murder them selfs this is nuts why ai t he in prison too / []

Pure guilt / []

All PEDOS / []
His tone deaf confidence is the funniest event of 2019😅😅😅😅 / []
I just watched a podcast with the producer of this interview.  She said after months of negotiations they were allowed to come in and there were no questions barred.  She said when Andrew came down early to see what was going on, they were all panicking.  He also brought one of his daughters with him!!  He said they were going out for coffee or some other BS, so he let her sit there and listen to all of that about her father.  Father of the Year material right there!  So the producer at the end of the interview, was terrified they would get a call the next day saying in no way was the BBC allowed to show that footage, but she wasn't sure because Andrew seemed pretty pleased with himself.  So the producer asked Andrews assistant, "so how do you think it went"?, and she said "Wasn't he marvelous"?!!  The producer was shocked, and really wasn't sure it would go to air until the moment it did.  Andrew thought he had suitably impressed everyone, and offered them a tour of the Palace!!  He thought he did a great job, and that everything would be smoothed over from then on.  What a noob. / ['Exactly same reason I finally watched it.', "What's the name of the podcast?", 'Now That is incredible!! Wow. The ultimate liar has practiced them so much, his truth becomes the truth', 'podcast:https://youtu.be/A0x6G5AW6Uw?si=A7UVvreb64LxiXyn', "@samanthaking1367 I just think that Royals aren't used to ever being challenged, except by each other.  Staff would never have any opinions, lest they be out of a plum assignment."]
Being a prince , you’d send someone in your stead…. / []
She was masterful at this interview, and I can't wait to see where she lands next. What a life she's led already, and she's still a young woman.  I wish she'd move to Canada.  She could run for Prime Minister and win right now!!  I just love her. / []
Obviously everyone knows this but i will clarify      soo the MET police should arrest him but they haven't if you do  crimes abroad you are still liable in the UK this shows how corrupt met police is and how they protect Pedos   just type in Jon Weger he investigated pedos in the MET and his investigation led to people like prince andrew soo the met police set him up and got rid of him this runs deep!!!! / []
This was pure slaughter. / []
Bloody hell😂 / []
Why is this scumbag reptile not in prison? / []
PA brought up JE and GM and the “shooting party” on his own.  He states that he became friends with JE through GM who is now in prison for soliciting young girls for sex. She was bringing in young girls for very wealthy men to use and abuse.  What part of this did PA not understand?  He also knew that JE was a convicted pedophile yet he traveled to the USA and stayed with JE.  This man is really in denial about everything.  He speaks about it being “honorable” to visit and break off his friendship with JE.  PA is definitely not telling any truth at all.  He is a liar, a pedophile, a rapist and in total denial about his behavior.  PA did himself no favors for himself by remembering specific details but not others.  He makes no sense whatsoever. / []
He would have been better off not doing the interview lol / []
Перевод Э / []
What a liar.males me sick him and his Saville loving brother pair of nonces / []
What you have to understand is …😂😂😂😂PLEASE YOUR SOOOO GUILTY ITS ASTONISHING!! / []
What a clear LIAR , you don’t keep contact with sex offenders. After they have been convicted of assaulting, a minor, and say, it’s a chicken. If you don’t go to New York, to confront them in person, he went to have another good time with his old buddy, which has always been his buddy, and that is clear it had nothing to do with his girlfriend it had to do with what was on Jeffrey Epstein’s island and in his homes, and like he said he was trained to detect these things, so he clearly knew what was going on, which is why he can no longer use his HRH title!! And that is a slap on the wrist well, I actually wouldn’t even say a slap say a slap he got a handshake 🤝! / []
If this interview was held privately I can just imagine him standing up - and being rude - and walking away (the real Andrew ) / []
He paid her off…that’s not an innocent man’s reaction / []
Someone who tells the truth does not have to think for ages for the right answer - / []
G maxwell was in the business of saving our seas and its species with her lectures - just a shame that young females human species was at the  bottom of her list / []
This interviewer is very sharp - to the point -  Very talented lady - he was sweating during this interview for sure -  He thought he could come up trump - how foolish of him - / []
He is not a decent person - He could not care less about any underage girl like any of these people who used these girls  He had a good time and thought he would never be caught  Just sorry he got caught / []
I fall asleep to this / []
Did Jeff suck his wife's toe / []
I came to this with a very open mind but what he says makes absolutely no sense.  I am sorry that Elizabeth II seemed to accept what he said but relieved that Charles III does not.  His comments and his reports of what he did condemn him. / []
This never gets old / []
This is just gross / []
Bullshit Bullshit  Bullshit / []
how is it posible that this pedophile isnt in jail? / []
The man all but literally dug his own grave on national television. / []
How is this sick fuck not locked up / []
He's just a distraction.  The real story is just how dark Epstein's peculiar life, his peculiar island and his cohort of powerful and influential 'friends' got.  This stuff is to keep the deeper truths hidden.  "Don't look there!  Here's a naughty Prince to occupy yourselves with".  The Island is where the real questions wait for an answer. / []
I can imagine this is how I would look when I'm caught red handed for doing wrong. I'm too honourable to make such mistakes of course. / []
I really wo der how Andrew was the queen's favorite.  He was, but why?  When he claims to be non-confrontational person is a joke.  Everyone says he is syraight up abusive.  A manner unbecoming....a sex offender and trafficker.  Great interview. / []
He just keeps shakung his head back and forth.   Poor Andrew.....just no memory of meeting the underaged girl. / []
Such a liar.  Einstein home was the only place he could get lodgings while doing business for 4 days in New York City.  This is ridiculous.   Andrew is a bad liar.  Plus, Andrew is a horrible person.  He is abusive, rude and aweful to anyone who worked for him.  Everyone has said he is abusive. / []

I agree with all disparaging comments but would make the additional comment that he comes across as quite dim and unskilled> How can he be suitable for any of the positions for which he was hired? / []
Oh, come now, Andrew!  “I was never a partier .”?????  He wasn’t called “Randy Andy” for nothing!  Pictures of him in magazines water skiing in the nude?!?  And just one of the many  newspaper articles about him tells of being entertained by topless women!  I would have respected him much more if he just would have said “Oh, I was quite a partier when I was single and young, yes M’am!”   😊 / ['. . Oh the pictures of him water skiing in the nude was just a straightforward shooting weekend.. and those pictures of him sozzled in nigtclubs were just simple mistakes, because he accidentally wandered into Stringfellows instead of the Ritz ..']
I'm sorry for Prince Andrew he's so thick! Not 1 brain cell working. When  Emily says is there anything you can add? "No, I don't think so!" Idiot! The 1st thing to say is I would like to take a stand and speak out for the abuse of young women. I want to raise the profile of women's abuse. He could have said so much about women's/ girls rights to be free from grooming and sexual abuse. He didn't! Too narcissistic and arrogant! / []
Prince Andrew your a Liar / []
When you look at this guy..Do you really think he's going to tell the Truth..No Way..Andrew knew who Epstein was and all about..Just imagine how many pedophiles this guy knows / ['This is why he used the codeword Pizza Express in the interview. To let the others know that he was going down, so were they !']

Am , am , am  😮 / []
He gives reasons to "prove" that he didn't spend time with the girl, but never says he would never do all those things with a minor... / []
Thank you for giving us an inside look to our world with a real understanding. That's why understanding is needed because if this more than ever doesn't show that non of us are perfect. I don't know what else. Pay taxes lol. And what about the animals!??? 🥰❣️ / []
Hey Andrew how’d the interview go? Okay?   No sweat. / []
He says people act differently around him 😂 if I ever met him I’d do this thing where I was so polite and pretend to be into every word coming out of his mouth to make him comfortable all the while making a fool of him in a way that everyone at the table would understand what I was doing but only he couldn’t pick up on it. I’m a master of this. This tactic can only be done on people who have zero self awareness with a huge ego and zero intelligence. That trifecta of person is delicious to make fun of to their face and they don’t realize it. I wonder how often it happens to him? He only hangs with people who would kiss up to him probably because they are wealthy and use him as a useful idiot for their own gain. / []
I always heard rumours Andrew, William and Harry were dumb as shit bit we never get to hear them in words that aren’t already prepared for them so we had no proof even though from a distance they did seem glib. This interview changed that. His un intelligence is on full display and he is the type of dangerously dumb that he doesn’t realize he is. At least Harry admits and knows he isn’t very smart and his knowledge of this just makes him endearing. Andrew probably watched his interview after being maligned in the press over it and STILL couldn’t pick up on the stupidity we all did. 😂 how embarrassing to be him. / []
Never been upstairs. But knows it's upstairs. / []
Peado fk / []
The only two negative adjectives that occur to Andrew, in thinking back on what "we _now_ know" was going on in Epsteins residences, are:  "strange and unpleasant."  Not shocking, disgusting, horrifying, heartbreaking or heinous.  Not cruel, indefensible, inexcusable or serious.  Not disturbing, sickening, stomach turning or evil.  Not... well, any of us normal people could go on for columns.  Andrew DID attend fancy schools.  He  presumably does have a reasonable command of English.    But "strange" and "unpleasant," that's all he could come up with? / []
"I'm _convinced_ I was never in Tramps with her." / []
There is no way Andrew would have settled for such an enormous amount unless he was guilty. / []
Andrew went to see Epstein to try and ensure his sexual activities with minors never came out.  That's why he chose to discuss things in the park so they could not be recorded and used by Epstein et al to blackmail him. / []
“That couldn’t have happened bc I can’t dance, I don’t drink, I don’t sweat, it simply couldn’t have happened “ 😂😂  Edit: “also, Epstein doesn’t take pictures so it can’t be a real picture.  It just can’t.  I always wear a red tie when I go there so it can’t be” 😂 / []

I have heard all of the sweating and Pizza Express stories. I knew about this interview when it came out, but I have only just now taken the time to watch this. It is an incredible interview. / []

In 2000 years, historians will know of Emily Maitlis / []
I can't excuse him for what he did, but didn't we as Americans have a certain president that flew to Epstein's island? / ['And?']
This interview killed the Queen / ['Pretty sure the fact that she was 96 years old had a bigger part to play in it mate…']
is he going to vote for Donald Trump? / []
Reminds me of the court room scene of the Simpsons where the witness is screwing up big time and Homer tells Bart "Let's see where he's going with this" / []
A missed opportunity when she said Epstein's housekeeper said he had daily massages on the four times a year he visited Palm Beach. He disputed the number of visits but she should then have asked whether he had had any massages at all there and by whom. / []
Epstein did not have relations with any family, he was wrong. / []
he only remembers what he wants slimey chap.what a load of his lies / []
2:53 “I’ve never really felt the need to go…potty.” Dang. I mean, I knew the royalty were out-of-touch and self-delusional, but this takes the cake! / []
Fraudien slip. He said what I was doing oh no what he was doing / []
Look into his eyes … / []
Ghastly individual he is.💩💩💩 / []
Andrew Andrew Andrew. Gawd love. He comes across as an arrogant out of touch idiot. Upper class Twit of the year. / ['Hes extremely out of touch. Hes known nothing but the wealth and royal entitlement his whole life and its destroyed him. He said my tendancy to be too honourable coloured my judgement. And its all fixed with money. His mum paid 12 million to out of court settle. I feel like virginia giuffre could of milked this very wealthy family of alot more than 12 million. She knows shes up against royal family. She knows he will never be in a jail cell. The only outcome is settle out of court for life changing money and thats what she did. 12 million. shes changed her and her familys life forever with the money. Shes now one of the wealthy with her settlement.']
Superb / []
He stayed there because of Jeff’s girlfriend. Maxwell??! The person serving 20 yrs for trafficking to no one. Amazing. / []
All that education and not an ounce of humility everyone who has ever talked about him long before this has said Andrew was a terrible human being honourable is the last thing anyone ever said about him I am sure it will be on his grave along with this interview. / []
Nev       Banished  to the Welsh  Palace / []
STOP VICTIMISING ANDREW.  ISN T DIANA ENOUGH!  OPRAH VISITED EPSTEIN ISLAND OFTEN, WHY???? / []
Filthy Liar / []
Well he's still a free man, hoping the King strips him of everything,sleazy creep should be in Jail. / []
Sounds like a little boy lieing. It's so obvious 😅 / []
GUILTY AF / []
I have tried about 29 times and and still haven’t made it past 10 minutes of this . He’s disgusting! / []
I always return to watch this interview. Just so entertaining LOL / ['I\'ve been laughing for at least 5 minutes at the pause after: "But you were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender."']
HOW UNKIND   HOW DARE YOU OSTRACISE THIS MAN AND LET OPRAH ETC WHO CONSTANTLY VISITED EPSTEIN ISLAND IN PEACE!!?? / []
STOP VICTIMISING ANDREW.  THE MEDIA KILLED DIANA  DO YOU WANT A SECOND ROYAL VUCTIM?  OPRAH VISITED  THAT ISLAND MANY TIMES.  ARE YOU HOUNDING HER?  WHAT WAS SHE  DOING THERE????????? / ['Same thing as Andy lol']
He went to visit him to tell him that he couldn’t visit him / []
He's guilty He's a pig! / []
Straight away just a few seconds in I can see how stressed he is. His tie is crooked / []
In the UK on your 100th birthday you get a message from King Charles. On your13th birthday you get a text from Prince Andrew. / []
Winnie Wallace..... He should change his name to Billy.. Billy Liar, or Billy Bullshit....what a creep!!. / ['Walter Mitty']
Best interview of the century👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 / []
Unbelievably guilty! / []
This is kind of similar to police interviews where the smart thing to do is to say nothing. / []
so unfortunate, that a royal title does not come with intelligence included. he was probably not the queen‘s favourite, he was simply the one that needed the most help, because he is not the brightest. he is not credible at all. so weird. / []
Nice of the British people bailing him out with taxpayers' money.  I don't think prison was a 'convenient' place for him to stay. And at the Ice Hockey, they expect us to stand for the national anthem! / []
Hemming on the trousers needs work / []
hes lying through his teeth look at the nervousness when hee speaks and coonfronted about uncomfortablee situations  he cant cant a straight face or say a coomplete sentence without  stuttering / []
This could be comedy sketch it’s that bad / []
the only thing im shocked at is he went to pizza hut ive had thought  he goes macdonalds as they do happy meals for gfs / []
“the problem here is that i’m TOO honorable” is a really spicy strategy / []
What do Weinstein and Epstein have in common? / []
Well done Ms. Maitlis. 🙏❤️ / []
SCUM DIRTY FILTHY SCUM.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS THE INTERVIWER. / []
This is the second time I have watched this and he is so pathetic, I cannot stand to watch. / []
Watching again years later and I am still amazed that a man that has lied and manipulated his entire life is so bad at it! Now that the queen is gone I hope they come back around to him and he’s forced to be held accountable. / ['Epstein files may help but I reckon he’s untouchable. No chance did Charles and the late mother not know about this']
Oh please if someone is convicted of this you wash your hands of them! You don’t go & say I’m sorry I can’t see you any more! / []
Sad / []
Why would you have to meet someone after being being convicted of that to cut ties could you have phone him if not just done say anything lieing c u my / []
I don't sweat because I use Lynx Africa. / []
Going to pizza express is an unusual thing to do I’m so special / []
He got away with going to prison / []
“Yes sir…you should absolutely do this interview with Emily” - the people who gave this advice to this doofus😂😂😂 / ['The staff must hate him']
Yoy need locking up rat / []
"You dined with her. You danced with her."  "Nnnnoooooooo...???"  😂 / []
Keep in mind he thought the interview went well and that he had fooled everyone... Dude probably still thinks the public doesn't know he's a sex offender. / []
I ve been waiting for the part where he finds a good time to refect on all the young , some very young ladies that he was a part of treating.unhumanly. He only worries about those that affect his wealth and influence. They all will get their day before a judge that doesnt swear in to get truth. / []
WASNT TRUMP SUPPSED TO BE IN LOVE WITH THE JEWS AND ISRAEL? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON NOW? / []
DOESNT MR EPSTEIN WANT TO GIVE AN INTERVIEW HIMSELF? DOES HE THINK HES TOO GOOD TO DO SO? / []
WHY DONT 2E WE LET MR EPSTEIN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF?! IM SICK OF EVERYONE PICKING ON HIM / []
Randy would deffo be an amazing politician / []
Aww he ‘never felt the need to party’ … what an absolute gent, bless his little cotton socks 😳 / []
Yes 7 to 14 years old perfect job for you ? Y are you Moy in jail and funny your man is dead,  more silence like the English rose yiur a afull on wrongun and you what about the poor girl ? Deluded weongun simple you should be in jail as if it was a normal man well not normal they would be on jail love watching yiu squirm you bees to be in jail mumys boy end of / []
Disgusting! / []
Full of 💩 / []
"I've got to show leadership" to what? Say he don't want to be freinds with a sex offender lmao / []
So it because of sheer convenience for Andrew to stay with a convicted pedophile.... / []
full of lies whats the point in the interview / []
I’m still looking for the comment where it mentioned him getting foot massages and (sarcastically by the commenter) they replied as Andrew saying “well that’s odd because at that time I didn’t have any feet” 😂😂😂 very dark truth we are observing, but the humorous comments bring a lighter side to it. / []
Damaging to you ? What about the 15 year old ? 🤔 wrongun / []
You need locking up simple watching you swuirm embarrassing lock the beast up what is wring with this world 🌎 lovk him up pizza boy sad man / []
omg never Andrew never A! / []
Just look at his face…😅 He’s 🤥 / []
His condition of not sweating, but only at that time so I sweat now so you can’t test me, real shame I know / []
He remembers pizza with his daughter but a pic taken with a teenager, no never I can’t recall that at all / []
He keeps being up ghislaine, did he not know the fbi was looking for her during this interview to bring her in for the same stuff ? / []
The laughing and the funny enough I don’t comments are just insane. This interview in court for a good lawyer during cross exam would be a gold mine for said lawyer. They would eat him up / []
Too honorable to not stay at a sex offenders house? And the way he says it so matter affectedly like that’s the answer you can’t deduct any more from it / []
I invited her but him ti my daughters birthday. Wouldn’t you probably want to tell her but ti bring him after he was just arrested ? He would be privy to that info / []
He contradicts himself so much it’s crazy. Well you see I didn’t invite Jeffrey who I had seen for financial advise, it was his girlfriend. He was simply a plus one I barely knew him. Didn’t you just say you went to see him personally to learn about finance and now he’s just a plus one? The plus one comment was wild and knowing and being friends with maxwell is just as bad man / []
This guy is such a pompous ass it is staggering someone could be so smug and entitled. The way he talks is so demeaning, like he is the smartest person ever trying to explain something only he knows to someone that’s stupid and below him in his mind. “You see I was in the navy and in the navy you are isolated because you spend so much time at sea” like what he believes this woman and her audience are literal idiots and we have ti believe him because why he is a royal / []
He went to see him in person ti tell him that that couldn’t be seen together? Why not just call him? Also kinda implies they were good buddies if you felt you had to go in person to tell him this / ['👏']
This will go down as the biggest car crash in history, / []
A man who would often be too arrogant to wait for the electric gate to be opened at one of the royal residences so would just deove through it / []
Is he not sad😂 / []
@40:35 again Andy laughs at Jeff's death / []
It's disturbing when Andy laughs about Jeff's suicide @38:15 / []
He couldn’t sweat😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Get his brother  on  homelessness ⁷not a big issue / []
Can i ask 1 question yiur mum.paid 12 million i believe but yiur inocent ? Where yiu are not in jail ? As if it was a normal well not a normal man as yih and them people aint normal ,imagine if if was your daughter you nedd locking up and should be you make me crindge wrongun / []
I think this entitled POS narcissist walked away from this interview actually thinking “nailed it.” If I were British, I’d be ENRAGED my taxes went to him and people like Meghan Markle to traverse the Earth and live everyday in the most privileged circumstances, telling people how to live their lives all while actually called “Royal.” Makes me sick. / []
This reminds me of a British Comedy skit. 😂 / []
Its very strange that he cannot acknowledge that it was wrong to have Epstain as a friend, not just to visit him on that occassion after his conviction. By asking him only if he would have wanted  her daughters to be friends with Epstain. If you mix with those characters, its bcs you are either one of them or you really know how to keep them at the right  distance and respect your position. / []
I don’t know where tramps is, I don’t remember buying a drink when I was there ! Lol / []
Maybe another interview with him and his friendship with Guerlain / []
Disgusting man / []
Champagne comedy / []
Richard Head. / []
Release the Epstein Client lust. And explain why the Almost fully naked teenager was escaping the castle??? Epstein Island Guest Prince Andrew 😠 / []
I like it this person helps me 2 sleep. / []
Fancy paying 12 million quid to someone you have never met ......lol / []
(OVER THE PHONE)  Andrew: I'm terribly sorry, Jeff. Its quite the inconvenience, but the public eye has unfortunately deemed the idea of a royal Prince and a well known sex offender continuing their friendship as bizarre and inappropriate.   Jeff: Sure, Andy... I get it, pal.. no hard fellings...  Andrew: Tremendous! I knew you would understand, ol' chum.. So! Let's schedule a party for next week, shall we?   Jeff: Ohhh, Andy! Fiesta, fiestaaa!  Andrew: Just don't forget to share those girls this time! / ['XD \n\nAndy: "Delicious meal, Jeff." \n\nJeff: "I couldn\'t agree more old boy, how about we work it off via a stroll through Central Park?" \n\nAndy: " Marvelous idea, Jeff." 😂😂', '@joshuagrover795Jeff: Too bad about that paparazzi...\n\nAndrew: Indeed! Who would have thought we\'d be spotted in the most idyllic park in America!? Not to worry, old chum. I\'ll call mummy!\n\nJeff: Mummy to save the day again, ey, old boy? Heh heh.. \n\nAndrew (on the phone to the queen); "Hello, mother dear. Hmm. Yes. Thats right, Indeed. Bitty, mummy. Bubba need Bitty.."']
What a creep....and he is still not imprisoned? / []
Lying ass rapist / []
Y in you on jail ? How you have kids it's behind me at pizza hut you killed the queen you wrongun / []
Wrongun / []
Best jntwrview look at at his face lock him up the rat / []
Where ain't you in jail ? / []
Have they got us Andrew? / []
This is daylight exposure for the world to see . Here we have a member of the Royal family hanging out with sex offenders . God knows what the rich and famous got up to on that private island . The Royal family have protected this thing , with zero moral compass.  To not even want to clear his name from what the world now sees , as a corrupt Royal family who think they are  immune from crimes against underage kids . Just know that when it's his time to meet his maker , his hell will only just be beginning for him 😊 / []
Can we all say horse snot!!!! Nobody believes randy Andy of very young girls / []
Painful. / []
Masterpiece / []
A shooting week en killing stuff no thanks. Crazy. We have deer and squirrels but they are never shot  a trapped guy / []
Well done to the interviewer you got the disgusting man...his ingrained arrogance got him as well...I doubt that he cares what others think of him as long as he continues to enjoy the lifestyle monarchy affords him and his lot.. which is only possible because stupid/ brain washed people allow this theft of your hard earned money to continue. / []
If he admitted he was in the photo with the girl and met her he would have been okayBut he lied. / ['Y did they pay her 12 Millon should be in jail look at his face shocking man lock him up with his teddies']
13:40 - 14:20 I challenge anybody in the world to say he isn’t lying. / []
Too honourable?!🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
If you watch this at double speed, it's even more telling. / []
Andrew and his staff all got jobs at Pizza Express in Woking after this Interview. / []
He ended the friendship and then stayed at his house multiple times, because it was convenient?!? I am sure Prince Andrew had enough money to pay for a hotel room... / []
No denial, just "I have no recollection". JE didn't kill himself! / []
He was friends with Ghislaine Maxwell... Wasn't she the one "arranging" underaged teenagers for Epstein and other men? 🧐 Ms Maxwell is not in the least better, than Epstein! / []
Bring "extra ordinary people" and underaged teenagers together, he meant, right? 🤮 / []
If I hear him say funny enough one more time I'm going to lose it / []
It Wasn't Prince Andrew. The photograph was not a fake or Photoshopped, It's a very common thing in the film industry, that Epstien would have known.. The Charactar masquarading as Prince Andrew was a body Double, look alike. Any half baked idiot could tell the difference, so lay off. It was quite clearly a set-up. To do the dirty on the royals. Keep your knickers on, and you can't be in 2 places at Once.🚔😉 / []
He's a dirty inbread nonse get rid of the royal family / []
49:27 minutes of drilling a whole in his brain to make everyone aware of each important details that stick perfectly to facts. Thank you! / []
The Royal Family is Children Molester Family! Their German Origin make that possible! / []
delulu man who thinks people are stupid and they will believe whatever he says coz he is too honorable to say lies / []
He reminds me of a spoiled,rich, narcissistic kid who thinks laws are made for people like us.while he says the rules and laws don't apply to him / ['thanks']
I am appalled at the many comments singularly praising the interviewer and not grasping the depth of the dastardly subject. This interview is a case study indeed of a guilty global elite in denial, deflection, and obstruction regarding his involvement of a planted global actor involved in nefarious criminality. Any first rate educated journalist should be capable to ask the right questions to glean the information. Journalists’ role are to get the stories accurately, and should not be the subject. / []
the gun shot in the Falklands was a fire cracker at one of his parties / []
Prince Andrew was exposed by American courts in the US, if it was in Britain he wouldn't have been exposed at all, he would have gone scot free. In Britain no one has the gall to exposed any Royals / []
13:41 this part exactly is when you can see his soul leave his body 😱😱😱 like : " yeah I'm fu*ked" / []
Wow, what a dumbass / []
"Well we couldn't have had sex because I didn't have a penis at the time" / []
you're full of shi..t a hypocrite and ashole you make me sick just lies. / []
Crazy how he remembers all other instances of the past to intricate detail, but then he does not recall taking a photo with an underage girl. / []
This guy is thick as shite ...really fkn stupid !! / []
We will never know the truth which is covered by many who know what went on / []
imagine being so honourable you feel the need to stay with a PDFL friend and you show your leadership by going to meet him for a number of days to tell him you don't want to be friends any longer...wow / []
Arrogance personified / []
you would meet like minded PDFL's / []
They met because of money 💰💰💰 / []
I died at “I can’t sweat” / []
Just passing by and I am wondering, what will Andrew think of his interview in a. Few years time? Will he Regrets knowing Epstein then? / []
Bisous bonne nuit mandrapihaona Prince malalako / []

Every single person staying at Epsteins would have to be declared and certified to stay in the same house as a royal. His security would not take that risk / []
Of course he did all he is accused of. Because he could. It had been going on for so long, and still is, with many famous people involved, and they get away with it. And it’s as simple as that. / []
Clown Andrew. / []
Anyone  wondering why Harry is disturbed or why he and his wife wanted to put an ocean and a continent between them and people like these must be compelled to watch this monster. I saw an interview with someone who went to school with the Windsor boys and their pack. He says he left the UK primarily to get far away from these type of empty entitled useless people. No problem believing that. / []
Is inviting women to parties illegal cross border destitute traficcking, nope!!!! / []
Lie lie lie lie is all this guy is doing / []
His judgement was so poor in what he actually did, that this interview was always going to be horrible. His actions defied justification. His attitude during the interview made it worse. Most of us never knowingly go for walks in the park with convicted sex offenders. He doesn't seem to appreciate that. We don't go and stay at their houses because they are convenient places to stay. / []
I didn’t sweat AT THE TIME 😂…. BUT NOW I AM ABLE TO DO SO ….  WOW.   JUST UNBELIEVABLE / []
This is a perfect example of someone trying to SQUIRM out of something / []
Wow. I didn't know the BBC was allowed to show a suicide on TV... / []
" i interacted with all the people in Epstein house, Good morning, How are you ? " .... Yup what a prince / []
wen ya gonna  get  um to say fake lies..lets see h9w good  5he pros are ..cos i dnt the truth / []
thats a classic it's  like a  railway..WHERE KINGS CR9😂 / []
What a disgraceful human. Glad he is no longer is view. / []
Where r the other sex offenders ? / []
DEFLECTION, understand it. / []
His Family must have been cringing..whoever advised him to do this interview is definitely not well balanced. / []
Prince Andrew did nothing wrong.   There were only 2 crimes committed.The first is that Virginia Giuffre was not a victim and grossly overcharged Epstein for happy endings.She shouldn't have gotten a penny more than $20 bucks.She was a Ho and a grifter.I vote we prosecute her for breaking the law and working as a prostitute and ,secondly , she should have to pay back $280 for every happy ending she gave.She was never a victim and should be very ashamed of herself for being a grifting Ho!!!   In the USA in the 1980's 17 year old ,cleancut, educated women would offer this service right to your face.I had maybe 20 but would never have paid a penny more than $20 bucks a pop. / []
Too honorable!  Lololololo / []
Completely and utterly corrupt to the core. Like most of them. / []
Malignant lying sociopathic narcissist. Andrew is ok. / []
How could you possibly go and stay in a persons house 3 times a year and not be close friends? / []
An amazing interview. Anyone who disagrees might ask themselves how they would approach this differently.  And yes, supporting other comments, she is stunning in terms of intellect and also a beautiful person. / []
He can't even talk with  conviction / []
He can't even talk  with  any type of consistency / []
I think  Charles thinks . You funked up . Now get yourself out of it / []
I think if he's  brother  was supportive.  He would have advised him what to say. And he obviously didn't. / []
The World be alot more interesting if people told the truth. / []
"I couldn't have had sex with this woman, at Jeffrey's... because actually, I dont have a penis, it was shot off during the Falklands".  - Prince Andrew / []
And whatever happened to this issue? Conveniently forgotten about / []
Convenient place to stay!! How many hotel rooms are there in New York City? / []
Says “met Epstein through his girlfriend” is that the girlfriend who was providing all his, and your benefits? That friend? / []
This is horrible to say, but I watch this interview every so often to remind myself that it isn't just the USA that has horrible people in positions of power.  Who the hell told him this interview was a good idea? Does any British taxpayer money go to him currently? How does he survive? / []
you could just tell from his expressions etc he is guilty as f*** / []
What a discrace of a man. / []
Bcnfc😊rvv a❤🎉 / []
Bcnfc😊rvv a❤🎉 / []
HRH Elizabeth The Queen did the right thing to strip him of his royal titles. / []
Plus , he had to spend days at his place to explain why he could no longer spend days at his place. / []
Getting rid of abuse? What a douche / []
What a lieing purv / []
"I'm not very close with this man Jeffrey Epstein, and only knew him through his girlfriend Ghislaine, but after he was convicted of sex trafficking underage girls I felt like it was the chicken's way out not to go and stay with him at his home and tell him that we can no longer have contact and cannot be seen together anymore. Oddly enough, I choose a very public walk in a park in one of the largest, and most heavily populated cities in the world, to tell him that we can't, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE... be seen together." / []
whats the problem of having a foot massage? / []
Fly to new york to break up your friendship with a sex offender. I'd have texted "Delete my number and fuck off" / []
Did he say,  "not very good friend," and then say"not very, very good friend," which was it, dearie?  As a "special representative for international trade and investment," he offended every country he visited. He wanted to be treated like Queen Elizabeth, II and Prince Phillip, coming on a royal tour. He did not and does not like to be treated as anything even remotely resembling a representative on a visit for mutual trade and investment. / []
This guy is worst than Epstein ..watching this interview ,a complete liar / []
You cluck little kids / []
You jowley, droped eyed lying cu*?. / []
Work, what work? / []
He’s not a chicken and he doesn’t sweat…..case closed / []
Chickens way / []
. . . 3 . . . 4 . . .after having watched this entire interview --  once in the past and now -- i just noticed the female interviewer's slick costuming here, surely meant to subliminally distract Andrew, to keep him off balance,  reducing his ability to concentrate his all: -- her bodice area is unbuttoned, heh!!!!   Subtle!  Genius! / []
Funny, he's all so dramatic about not knowing a Mr. Brockman (sp?), But not a word of denial about a foot massage !!!!!, In Epstein's nyc home!    Easier to just say "i never had a foot massage in my life". . . / []
'Tally ho my fine young trollop, your lucks in'!  Trot along here with all your cash and some naughty night attire and you'll be staring at my bedroom ceiling from now till Christmas you lucky tart'!  Ps ' woof woof'. Was Andrews undoing... / []
This video shows Prince Andrew is a irresponsible playboy, and a Mummy's boy. / []
"I know that I never actually met this woman, because I actually don't exist." - Prince Andrew / ['😂 lolol', 'Its giving American psycho']
No party at all / []
Disgusting pedophile / []
Idiot / []
If the rule you followed brought you to this.point of what use was the rule ?? / []
He’s a bully and insane. 72 bears on his bed. Sexual 🐷 / []
Interviewer extremely well prepared. Beautiful pacing. / []
"He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together..." Ya - young girls. / []
I believe him / []
I had to go and see him, to make sure he says nothing about me and the minors / []
To all the people that worked at (or visited) Woking Pizza express around that date, please speak up! There is no way anyone there would ever forget that event IF he was there. Similarly, anyone working there regularly around that time  should come and say "that did not happen". It's such as easy story to either corroborate or dismiss. / ['their pizza is not that memorable', 'Pizza has a different meaning here - there symbolism will be their downfall']
Royal or not he’s not very bright / []
I like to watch this annually. I get a kick reminding myself  I may not have been born offensively rich,  privileged, nor obscenely pampered... But by God, I'm not this dithering trainwreck. Oh, Andy-licious / ['Lol😊']
Entitled, narcissistic, morally deficient, indulged, self serving, and married a woman as bad as himself. Harry is just the same. / []
Epstein dead🤔 Andy sounds so sad to hear this news 🤔.Ghislaine is in jail🤔Is she how sad🤔 .Why aren't you in jail Andy🤔.Too honourable.👀. / []
Just glad we have the digital backup.Job done. / []
GUILTY AS FUCK / []
32:20 “when the allegations came out I thought oh that’s strange, I don’t remember this!” This guy. As if that would be your reaction if you were innocent 😅 / []
"that is what i would describe as me in that in that in that picture"  Lol / []
I've never seen a bigger b s'er / []
What a prick !!!! / []
"No, see, I stayed at his house for four days because I had to be there to tell him we couldn't be around each other anymore."  ?????? / []
KINDERSCHÄNDER !!!! / []
literally, didnt believe one word that came out his mouth during this whole interview / []
If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck its definitely a duck / []
It's painfully wonderful watching this liar lie. / []
This interview is the best tea I've ever drank. He should not of agreed to it. He has guilty written all over his stumbling muggy face 😂🎉 / []
They could not have picked a more perfect interviewer, pausing and allowing Andrew to dig himself into holes and then trying to get back out of them. Asking the right questions at the perfect time. Just a masterclass in interrogation / ['True, but I would still LOVE to watch a seasoned investigator from the FBI, or even Scotland Yard, interrogate him. THEN we\'d see how much he "sweat"! LOL', 'But let’s be honest guys Virginia is just a wh*re who sold herself for money , and got angry after being ignored , these people didn’t force her they don’t even need her.']
I’m coming over to NY to tell you what a naughty boy you have been but can I stay with you for 4 days … he is an embarrassment / ['Very well said!']
I had to show leadership 😂 what an idiot! Andrew you are guilty as sin / []
You let Jimmy Seville into the royal   family … Epstein must have been a shoe in / []
You can tell his lying I mean Prince Andrew going to Pizza express yeah right ! / []
You silly man. / []
Emily was and is superb 👏 …’give her all the awards’ ( as they say ) …..👑🏆 / []
british taxes at work / []
Buried himself 😂 / []
They should have give him a shovel lol,of course he done it / []
Why weren’t the police conducting this interview??? / []
A Nonse, reported to have paid £17,000,000 in compensation for his illegal activities. Question: Never having done a days work in his life where did he get the money from? Answer: US; THE BRITISH TAXPAYER🥶 / []
The way he emphasizes his suicide was scary. / []
Perhaps showering unearned and undeserved wealth and privilege on the descendants of dictators, who are above the law might be a bad idea in the 21st century? / []
Assistir uma longa entrevista do Principe Philip, ele se mostrou inteligente, coerente e muito inteligente.  Esse filho mimado dele é um absurdo. / []
Horrible liar. / []
A fat big liar!...The worst royal ever! Truly disgraceful!... / []
47:58 "Conducted himself in a manner unbecoming" 🙈 Geez, what an "unusual" way to describe a convicted sex offender. How then does he describe Hitler? A man with a lack of empathy? / []
Lol it was like a railway station at his house but I of course saw nothing 😂😂😂 so your expert security people agreed that staying in a house full of strangers going in and out was convenient 😅😅 / []
Virginia robinson paid off by prince andrew hush money etc / []
There must be footage of him in tramp night club with that young lady / []
i love how he keeps saying ‘i dont remember’ for everything but when he’s asked about the 10th of march 2001 (from when this interview was done that was 19 YEARS AGO) he suddenly remembers everything???? / []
When she asks about his message for Virginia, it’s one of the only moments he looks truly frightened. It was like the interviewer put Virginia in the room with them. Brilliant work. / ['Time stamp?', '\u200b@Paperroute88831:06']
Sounds to me like ghilaine and Jeffrey made sure they had insurance on some people, that's the only reason I can comprehend as to why he went of in 2010 after supposedly not speaking to the man in 4 years, to stay there and be pictured walking through a park. There seems to be no other reason / []
You sweat when your taking drugs ffs / []
I don't sweat ahhaah 😊 / []
Ssccumm / []
Nommce / []
😅Is this guy for real wtf / []
Not a surprise. This is typical of arrested development-never been held accountable for anything in his privileged existence. / []
Off with his head / []
Are you calling her a liar?  Well thats a difficult......wtf / []
Someone needed to check how much he was sweating 30min into this interview / []
There were only 8 or ten people there ...... / []
all that money and he can't find a shirt with a collar measurement that fits - he's got a constant neck muffin top. Rewatched this interview so many times, what an utter waste of space he is. / []
His tie is crooked / []
My judgement was probably coloured by my......em....em....cock / []
And mummmeee got him taken out in prison / []
Where else in the world can a paedophile pay off one of their victims using public money to escape justice. The royal family should be abolished. / []
Vile he should of been dumped by his family not protected / []
Sad man you and we all o what you are getting bed with your teddy's you dirty old man simple whatvyour security were around and is it funny ? God bless it dint happen to yiur 2 daughters dirty old man should be in jail 😮 / []
Im no body language expert but can tell when someone is full of shit and andrew you showed it all in this interview / []
Still hilarious! Absolute tit / []
Emily Maitlis !  You are an absolute LEGEND!!  You ARE A 1ST CLASS JOURNALIST! 🥇🏆with DISTINCTION 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 A 1ST CLASS INTERVIEW! So very well executed!!!! Without doubt, P.A created his very own  'CAR CRASH'  P. A. Lies through his teeth!!!!!!!  So Very Well DONE, EMILY!!!!!!👏👏👏👏👏 / []
Horrible horrible person . / []
He is an evil parasitic Barnacle on the keel of humanity. A totally arrogant, entitled, and worthless person. Remember, his big brother supported known child abusers. / []
This guy knows he can just deny and even though everyone knows hes guilty he'll never see justice / []
The reason he could bring these extraordinary people together is they all love having sex with kids / []
If there are doubts about his whereabouts can't this be confirmed by the ever present security guy? If I was Andrew and wanted confirmation that I went to a pizza joint or not I would insist on the bodyguard getting asked. (Though the idea of a royal going for a takeaway just doesn't ring true. ). Times change. I recall him being featured fully naked in the Sun Newspaper as a ''healthy young man having fun with friends.'' When he was the darling of the media. / []
Honestly gives a bad name to the house of Windsor. / []
Cheak will pizza express / []
A face can tell the whole story he ain't as clever as would like to think / []
GUILTY! / []
positive action...negative consequences / []
"A picture is a thousand words"...an extraordinary disgrace...embattled fool / []
"I don't remember going upstairs...but thats (picture) upstairs" / []
"so therefor" / []
21-36 on the tape...time / []
Andrew says about sweating..."There is a medical condition that says I didn't do it" ...This ...Boy... is a demonstration that breeding and entitlement destroys intelligence...rather than foster it. / []
The foot massage question.  Hahaha! / []
Him and all the Royal scumbag criminal  family are a disgrace too the people of Britian. Harry is the only decent one od all of them. / ['Harry is in no way the only decent one you liberal socialist idiot']
Left Side, English car. / []
Photo is 100% fake. I WAS 9.8 GIUFFRE IN GERMANY / []
I regret the most that reputation such man is destroyed for now and for all, not fair.Why she has appeared after all these years with such allegations, did anyone ask?Did anyone put such question?  My opinion revenge for Lady Di death, Jeffrey knew more about that, this Scandal is nothing else than Pay Back  BLACKMAIL. I am 100% sure that Prince is not someone who could abuse someone, such Virgi. Is GIUFFREE legal surname, or result of imagination? / []
Conspiracy=123, 3x Sex, this Scandal led to Corona Crisis / []
He never made a penny for the UK during his time in International Trade and Investment. He used this time for golf skiing and partying! What a waste of space he is! Including a sexual predator, disgusting creature! / []
Wonder if he initially walked away from this interview and thought "that went well enough I think"? At some point in the very near future, I hope the Brits finally defund these over privileged genetic holdovers from the middle ages... it's a blight on your nation's legacy that the entire lot of these grifters continues to be handed unearned fame and fortune. / ["Shut the fuck up and stop chatting shit about another country you know nothing about. WE decide what's a blight on our legacy NOT YOU"]
Epstein aint here no more what a suprise same as the rose shocking  y aint he in jail look at your face youvsad man get in bed with your teddy bears then the kids are safe / []
Should be in jail with his teddy bears simple piss take yes we all belive you wrongun / []
We all no andrew , look at you sad sad man inmagine if it was your daughter thats y fergie left ya simple and the other 1 who aint here gid rest hwr soul and harry is in amercia sad sad man / []
Goodness, this guy is a buffoon.! He should have heeded his PR guys advice and kept silent. Slimey creep! / []
Ah, so this is what my mother sees when asking if I'd eaten the chocolate cake. / []
I can't help but imagine he walked out of this, gave himself a pat on the back & thought:   "Damn Andrew, you pulled it off." / ['😂', 'Apparently he did. The interviewer has discussed this interview since and said after the interview he acted as if it had been a great success 😂😂😂😂.']
"A constant drip that people want to know".....wtf / []
A Wonderful Maxwell Rally! / []
"Strange and Unpleasant Activities'.....this guy is a disgrace / []
Hit the wall stupid people / []
Affection...Andrew is a sweet train wreck / []
What a bloody pompous coward...despicable. / []
Um er umm er um aahhhh um er um um um😅 / []
He is certainly sweating now / []
You would have thought someone with his background and resources would have been better prepared and advised. Not even he has the ability deal with guilt, blue blood or not. / []
He’s a disgusting prat 😃 / []
Hes not the brightest. Do you get the feeling he was set up for a huge fall? / []
Of course you do realize if he had done this in England nothing would have been said no because he is a royal because the age of consent in the UK is 16 and the girl was 17Above the age of consent / ['That is simply to consent to sex, not consent to being trafficked for sex']
Tell me your guilty without telling me you're guilty....😮😮 / []
Actually, it might have been interesting if Paxman did the interview. Consistently and relentlessly asking 26 times the same question. "Did you engage in sexual activity with that girl?" I think that might just have buckled the Prince of Epstein island. / []
“Prince Andrew is bad at lying”  If you’ve seen that video, you know this man is guilty. / ["To think one of his daughters encouraged him to do the interview. Wonder how that's going now?"]
He more dangerous from Andrew Tates 😂 / []
He looks guilty as hell. His body language tells it all. She did a fabulous job getting him to talk and putting him in corners. / []
the man is still a total disgrace / []
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdg01PEqTd4 / []
"The photograph was taken upstairs but ive never been upstairs" 27:30 / []
One thing - out of the many - about the Prince's behavior that never made sense, imo, is the idea that he had any need to actually fly across the Atlantic Ocean and spend four days - including a tete-a-tete "walk in the Park" - in order to inform Epstein their bromance was over - in fact, if a person of eminence wants to ice you, they just stop taking your calls and a "cosmopolitan" like Epstein would have know that was that - it begs the question why would the Prince have to go such extremes to let the Commoner - and Epstein was about as common as one gets - down so so easy - could it be that the Prince had some apprehension that he didn't want the Commoner to be p*ssed at him?  Why would a Prince care?  Because maybe the Commoner had some dirt on him that could be a very inconvenient truth if disclosed?  Of course, Epstein is now known to have done of lot of filming and a lot of blackmailing - hmmm - and, oh, btw, a Prince of England had no other sheltering options when visiting New York City than to stay at Epstein's notorious fun house? - hmmm - well, in any event, I'll always wonder about that aspect of all this, not that the Prince gives a good g*ddamn what I'm wondering about, lol ... / []
This is the best you can get. Just let the man talk about his life. Of course, he'll never come out and say that he was involved, but by hearing him and his arrogance - you can deduce his role. Great job from the interviewer. / []
Disgusting / []
Scary to think there is a some, albeit faint, potential for him to be become king. / ['Him being king will mean the end of the British monarchy.', 'lol he’s so far down the line. It’s not even remotely possible at this point. Prince William, all his children, his siblings their children and his brother would all have to be dead if he were to take the throne.', "There's no chance he'd be king wtf 😂😂 clueless", '@Sh23-hv7sn He’s still in the line of succession. Go read a book and then comment 😆😆 clueless', '@alexk75 lmao he’s 8th in line. The entire royal family would have to be wiped out for that to happen.']
To be honestly blunt. What an entitled ashole / []
The mighty Royal Family and still the British support them bravo 🙌 / []
What he means is, "he has the extraordinary ability to bring peodos together". / []
That photograph is from upstairs. It can't be me bc I have never gone upstairs and I know that picture shows it is from upstairs. 😂 / []
I lost it when he said I don’t SWEAT 😭 / ['But then he said “not at the time.”. Apparently he’s been cured 🙄', '😂how did she keep a straight face when he said that?😂😂😂']
Such an honorable man! 😂😂😂 / []
Prince sounds guilty. The interviewer repeated the same question was annoying. / []
Did not know he had a stamer / []
He said it clear!! Theres no time to address all things associated to Epstein! His girlfriend! This was letting her know whats going down before she said anything! This bloke is full of it. You wouldnt let this plank on tv without a reason. Rememberring the target! Andrews only witness!! Mrs Maxwell. / []
He shouldnt have done this interview. The stupidity on his part  was off the chain..  My understanding the Family didnt know he was doing this. / []
Must Adjust That Tie.  It really bothers me for some reason. / []
Liar / []
Should have added Megaliar to the picture since she was part of Jeffery's hench women. / []
This interview is perfect even before he says a single word  ,,, his tie says it all  ,,, crooked  ,, / []
Why isn’t he in jail? / []
I love her outfit. Like a sci-fi/futuristic uniform with a classic touch. I need something similar for men. / []
Amazing he’s not in jail.., / []
As someone who lives in the Uk the fact that some of my tax goes towards this walking human cesspit boils my blood! / []
One of the best Car Crash interviews I have watched. I find it amazing that Prince Andrew hasn't been briefed better. Surely, he has advisors to help him! / ['Pedófilo mimado 😂', 'I’m sure I read somewhere his PR officer advised against him doing this interview, he said “I’m doing it” and she said “I resign” . I’m sure this was days before this was recorded', 'He is too arrogant to take advice', 'thank God for life', 'He had a squad of advisors telling him not to do it - but he thought he knew better...']
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU26x3qe5_w&t=3659s / ['Around 43 minutes in hear how Andrew can behave to his staff by a member of his staff.']
SEX IS COOL Emily talking about her best positions.......  / []
Cannot stand this woman / []
I, did, not, have, sexual relations, with THAT woman!!! 😂 / []
No recollection is not the same as I never…… / []
So like Megan Markle believing their own lies 😂 / []
" I don't remember' ???? . So many times she let him evade the answer. ???/ / []
Lying through his teeth / []
Bullshit / []
Omg The Minimizer 🤣 / []
He is so full of it / []
People,esp British people think Megan Markle is the problem?? This crap alone wld make me want out of this disgusting family. And I believe Diana wld agree, wouldn't you? Technically, Harry is like the Diana of his generation and her experience, I believe, wld help her understand his right to choose his "happy"..but, this THING OF A MAN, GETS VERY LITTLE BACKLASH. British people cannot be that stupid..can they? HE IS AN ENTITLED, NARCISSISTIC S.O.B.! NOT MY DAUGHTER,PRINCE ANDREW. YOU'D BE VEEERY SORRY / ["Yup, I'm English and just like America we have a lot of dumb 💩 ' s who will lambast Harry and Meghan and say nothing about this divvy on display here ✌"]
This interviewer would make an *AWESOME* DETECTIVE/INTERROGATOR! She should work at a police department part-time. The more silence there is, it gives him more room to talk and dig his own grave! / []
Total snake 🐍 / []
Would Andrew be comfortable leaving his daughters in the company of any of his associates for a personal massage smh / []
Just say you were banging girls who were 18 / []
His facial expression says it all. It really is unbelievable how a person can loose every last bit of honour and dignity. / ['Yes! His obvious facial expressions and deliberate responses as if he practiced in the mirror how to "act" if this and that is mentioned.', 'He and his family robbed and killed people.They are  worse than garbage.', '\u200b@bertisuesymons8784queen had to pay the 12 million. Andrew still lives at the 30 million pound royal lodge in windsor set on 96 acres of private estate. She was only able to go to cival court not criminal. Royal can not be criminally tried due to immunity.', "He has no immunity to a criminal trial, even the king or queen doesn't have immunity to criminal proceedings. You're wrong about that. He's guilty as anything but money talks, she got 12 million in the settlement", '@cephasmakuzva If you call her getting 12 million pounds, "him getting away with it".  The next day after this was aired, he was called into Charles\'s office and relieved of most of his formal duties.']
47:58 what a thrash by Maitlis, take a bow! / []
Andrew you entitled prat go away / []
Gulity 100% his place is in prison / []
Creepy perv  not a nice person / []
He really didn’t want to take the fall on ANYTHING. Not even the sweating. He was def under orders from the family to not implicate them in anything, too. Notice how intentional he is to distant them from the events. This entire interview is insane. / []
The way he latched onto the sweating thing was BIZARRE😂😂😂 / []
Disgusting / []
WHAT a moron 🤐😜😖🤪💥🥴🤧😳😳😝 / []
He has totally ruined his own life by the ways he has ruined so many others lives. KARMA 🤕🤕🤕🤕. / []
He says they weren't close close friends, then why would he want to fly to New York and tell him in person...why even bother?! PA is just downright pathetic! / ["That's the biggest red flag for me as well"]
This nonce's entire  ''defence '' is based on ... ' i cant recollect / remember '' / []
She really pinned this joker's ears to the wall. He doesn't party BULL TWANG.he doesn't sweat BULL  TWANG. and all the rest BULL'S TWANG. / []
😅 This is glorious. / []
Excellent interview.  Listen to the answers.  Make your own  Kind up.   Offenders  have a habit of re-offending. And again… Watch this  space . . . / []
I never did nothing wrong . / []
I would trade my 3/8 inch Lazar etched ratchet set for this lady. Mr. BUCKET / []
15:30- “fact of the fatter” / []
He's just like trump he's lying as a house off / []
I don’t believe him for a second. / []
Stuttering seeing is a sign of lying. / []
If you think Epstein committed suicide you are gullible. / []
He’s a lying. Lying, lying, lying. Dumb SOB. / []
Catch Andrew at a rave, cutting shapes to Sugarbabes. / []
I don't sweat 😅 / []
That stuff about not sweating MUST be a lie. / []
Why did this get more coverage than 290m$ paid out to other Epstein island victims? Actually did that even get a mention? / []
Its about the ISLAND. What happened on the ISLAND ? / []
12:10   "I have gone through this in my mind so many times" For someone trying to prove their innocence,  this has to be one of the worst lines possible. / []
How does he know the photo was taken upstairs at her house.... if he's never been upstairs in her house? / []
And he was the favorite?  What must the others be like?? Yikes!! / []
Oh Andrew  Where were your handlers ? / []
One word…. Looooollllll / []
He went to Epstein to tell him the relationship was off even though he says he wasn’t a good friend! Why do that Andrew😆…. Brilliant interview / []
I was never in this photo because I didn't exist at the time / []
He's lying, playing dumb and innocent. He's disgusting. I'm glad that Queen Elizabeth II stripped him of his royal and military titles. / ['He has beebcozying up with the government especially  priti patel,  to back him for a return to public life, that says it all!']
He just gave someone he has never met 12 million 😅 / ['Proper, perfect comment!! Like why would you.']
"Us, We." Clown / []
OMG this guy is such a cringeworthy liar / []
Andy had to cut it off because it looks bad and not because he was personally revolted… my goodness he’s deluded. / []
All the money this douche bag haves wouldn't you think he would get surgery to remove the bags under his eyes. / ['No']
Yeah yeah / []
Prince Andrew covered it up and is telling lies again whilst going for a Pizza. Antonio Futura Tiani3574 Ancoats Milesplatting Northern Quarter Little Italia Manchester. / []
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊 / []
Jeff had the most amazing way of bringing pedofiles* togetha, indeed….INSUFFERABLE despicable deviant this sob truly is! I’m so noble and I HAD to go and see him and kiss azz to make sure he didn’t release the KOMPROMAT he has on me (and everyone else btw). Did I do good mummy?!?👏👏 Unbelievable how all the K’er s skipped into the background. Wtfuh is that man’s black AND the miles of footage he’s got on almost every powerful and/rich people in the Western Hemisphere is what I’m wondering!!!! 🧐😳🤔 / []
I feel sorry for the Princess's and the Grandchildren..having a stain like that on your famuly ..christ the bullshit just flows out ..christsake and to think we pay for him..what a slimeball / []
Jesus he's such a moron / []
If he cant remember her why pay 12 million dollars a hell of alot sweaty dancing what a liar he is / []
"he had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together" ...and we all know how he did that / []
Slimy man… letting that near you 😷🤢 / []
Press X for doubt / []
What a nauseating, arrogant, entitled creep! / []
Amazing how she got slap on the hand n the firm made sure it wasn't talked-about anymore.  If Harry had done that  the firm had made sure he would have been thrown in the  fire. / []
This man shouldn’t speak in public again for his own good. / []
Reminds me of the Madness song when they say....youre an embarrassment. What about the girl he himself was waving out the door like a big creep / []
Prince of peed. / []
I wonder what Epstein thought of Andrew, after opening his house and hospitality to  him he made full use of his accommodation and dining then told him that he couldn't be associated with him anymore?...It sounds like usery does it not ?(honorable of course )... / []
Andrew was unwise to associate with the wrong people. Still, his accuser is obviously a sex worker looking for extra money. She was only too willing to be part of the racket. / []
You know what flying 8000 miles to tell someone you can’t be seen with them and being photographed with that very person presumably whilst your having that conversation is either weapons grade dumbf*c*k*ry or bovine waste. This man is not smart. But he is also full of poo. Hard to say. Dumb *u*k  though. / []
So he doesn’t know where the bar is but at the same time doesn’t recall ever buying a drink when he was there 😂😂 oh my days / ['He doesn’t drink and he doesn’t recall if he bought a drink there.']
Not a very good friend? Only saw him two or three times a year? Yet felt he "had" to break of that "not very good friendship" in person despite knowing he was trafficking?? What a fekn dirty rat liar he is! Filthy! Arrogant! Entitled! Vile! / ["Trump was friends with epstein as well and we all know his views on women. Andrew would have been around those sorts of people, hard to believe he didn't know"]
I’m getting the word…….. / []
And there you have it.....GUILTY and you let your poor mother pay them off to save you. / []
7:44 she asked him how he felt about finding out that Epstein was a convicted sex offender and all he says is “I distanced myself from him”….. oh and then reconnected with him …  😳😳😳 / []
She didn’t ask him about Koo / []
The late Queen has my deepest sympathy - to give birth to Two Male Sons neither of whom have ever displayed any Integrity, Honesty or Morality. The Crown should have passed directly to William. / []
Some of the most bold faced lying I’ve ever seen. The interviewer tripped him over many times but did not pounce on key moments in my view. / []
This man still deserves to spend time in an American prison. As the useless scumbag he is! / []
The fact that he thought this interview was a good idea is mind boggling. And how he is not in jail is even more mind boggling. / ['Can anyone explain why he is not in jail?', '@jackybogues2495it was a civil case and he paid the victim £12 million to settle it. Or his mummy did. UK police dropped criminal investigation because it was mainly outside their jurisdiction, and no criminal case has been opened in the US.', '@lieska333 seems like turning a blind eye to the super rich to me.', '\u200b@jackybogues2495$12 million', "He's not in jail because Mummy paid hush money to the most prominent victim, AND because he'd never dared set foot back in the USA, where there is a s-load of hard evidence awaiting him."]
Epstein was killed because he not only had dirt on Andrew, however, many people in the limelight, like Govt. Heads Of around the globe, Senior UN officials, Diplomats worldwide, Oligarchs and so called 'Celebs'. / ['Epstein was killed because he had dirt on the Clintons and celebrity supporters of the Democratic party.']
Andrews a prince and everyone would want a photo with him. The allegations dont match just a photo with a Prince. / []
Once he pays .$12,.000,000 this whole thing goes away. / []
A straight forward shooting weekend. It certainly should've been. / []
I come and watch this when I’m feeling down , it’s comedy gold / ['Ha ha, yup I needed a laugh. Doing the same thing']
It's just WOW.... / []
It's odd how HE gives more than she's asking for. In tid bits, re the photo he says at Maxwell house that photo was taken upstairs and I don't go upstairs because the dining room was downstairs. "Yes Prince, but the bedrooms were upstairs". I hope he gives another interview. / []
Great interview.  I wonder when Clinton , Oprah and Tom Hanks will be interviewed!   Trump said that he was so horrified by what he saw on the island that he decided to run for presidency to fix the border.  I believe that especially when you watch the interview with Trump and Tim Ballard. / []
This TV show brought to you by the 13 families / []
He nods his head yes, but says no. His body language tells it all. / []
Does anyone ever believe he needed to fly all the over to tell him good by verses over the phone or nothing? A teenager would have had a better lie. / []
This is a giant psyop.There is a special agenda involved.Can you guess what it is ? / []
In this moment the interviewee made me feel like there was no more soul in the world, but the interviewer... has restored my faith in humanity. / ["Proves nothing. He was just nervous. Wouldn't you be? Innocent till proven guilty!", '@fatpigsflybears not in the court of public opinion.', '@Humanpickle since when do the public dictate your own opinion or are you incapable of thinking for yourself?', '\u200b@fatpigsflybearstrees work very hard to provide you with oxygen.. you should apologise']
What an ignoramus.  He's "wracked his brain" over and over, multiple times!, trying to remember whether he had sex with a girl. ???? How many hundreds of young girls has he had sex with?  It would seem that going to Jeffrey Epstein's and having sex with an underage girl would be a singular occasion --that you would "remember" if you did, and "know for sure" if you didn't. / []
You lying sack of SWEAT and excrement. / []
The interviewer and Andrew have rehearsed this topic several time into "perfection" she's calm an collect no slips to her speach same speed and tone of voice for the entire interview  She is quick to help him without hesitation by strongly repeating his lies as good answers The hole thing is comical . / ["She's a journalist. There are many interviews where the interviewer does not slip over their words. That is literally a part of their job. She reiterates his lies for a reason. Did you watch the same interview everyone else did ?"]
Compare Andrew tate being interviewed to this bloke,  God bless the queen 👍 / []
Why was the pervert Andrew in Ukraine, earlier this year??? / []
If you ever want to question the fact that everything Q said in his drops is real, look no further. / []
A true high class gentleman wouldnt cross his legs in public. He is a low class man / []
See his majesty cut ties with him and told himself to hand him in.also i dont think 10:49 epstien was a criminal i think this is a witch hunt by the sensationist media / []
I can't believe what I am hearing... 🤦‍♀ / []
Also dignitaries meet a whole bunch of powerful people and you can never know / []
Right after this interview, Prince Andrew immediately went up to his room to cuddle with his teddy bears and suck his thumb.   What an absolute loser who has done nothing to benefit the world! / []
It’s September 2023 and back for another laugh 😂 / []
This reminds me of Bob Costas interview with Jerry Sandusky in 2011. Superbly conducted interview. / ['Oh man, that one was even more damaging.  Sandusky stammered on the simple question “are you attracted to children?”']
This guy is a villain / []
He should lose HRH status / []
No regret or shame. There’s only one reason to befriend Epstein. / []
He can’t explain because he’s guilty.  It doesn’t denigrate his abilities but on a personal note he should not be dealing with under 16’s / []
THE CROWN MUST WIN THE CROWN MUST ALWAYS WIN!😂😂😂 / []
UNMITIGATED DISASTROUS INTERVIEW THAT FULLY AND COMPLETELY DESTROYED HIM. / []
As Wenstein wisely points out...This interview is wildly bizarre.... / []
So there's a group of elite pedophiles holding the highest most powerful positions in the world. / []
Deeply entitled, self-aggrandizing, out of touch and morally questionable, if not reprehensible. It’s disgusting. What else has he been getting away with? / []
"I've never met you...This is crazy...Here's £25 million...Don't sue me baby" / []
Sounds like he's got amnesia all of a sudden 😮 you reckon he knows the time ? / []
BIG LYING BAZTARD. PEDOANDRO😝 / []
He must see Emily Matlis in his nightmares, or at least in some, I'm sure he has many nightmares. / []
Pizza Hut Woking / []
I trust him he is innocent. / ['You can feel it too right?']
Difference between a good liar and a bad liar. Andrew Tate: Good Prince Andrew: Bad / []
The foxes running the hen house.  Can you say, Jimmy Saville / []
Clearly the guy is a socio path and a liar. It's obvious! / []
Prince Andrew is a globalist monster who should be on trial! / []
11:25 Its what the British call "Stepping in a puddle" / []
She said you sweat. I'd don't sweat. GTFOH / []
The Prince has face this situation  head on, with dignity and humility, I can’t believe this was the only man in the Epstein list, the Americans elite have been very quiet about it🤨 / ['Dignity and humility………wow! Are you having a laugh? He is a predator who should be imprisoned for the rest of ITS life!']
This is Britain's royalty. Bunch of scum bags and low lying thieves and pedos with free money. / []
LAWS ARE JUST FOR SLAVES / []
Where's the second episode of this British comedy show? / []
It’s a stretch to believe this man stretches in the morning or a stretch to think he stretches before a workout. Stretches can stretch out a very stretchful stretch. / []
lol, this dude gives absolutely zero fucks. This is what power really looks like. Must've been so amusing for him. / []
21:45 i did not sweat at the moment cause i got shoot at a war i was never in but im sure sweating now regretting ever agreeing to this interview! i can just picture him waking up in the middle of the night covered in sweat screaming why!? Why the fuck did i do that?! / []

Emily Maitlis is a very impressive lady and imho one of the best interviewers in the world. Very few could have lead this interview in such an intelligent, respectful and commanding manner. This was by no means an easy task but she made it look like a walk in the park. Pure class. / ['She\'s the type that should be a "royal family". The royal family is a dead artifact anyway.']
‘ I didn’t sweat at the time ‘ 🤣🤣 / []
His poor mother had to bail him out financially.  At the queens age to deal with this shame . Even to strip him from  royal duties . / ['They’re all the same! She was only annoyed that he was caught, not what he was up to.']
John Brockman... REALLY???? 13:38 / []
One of the strangest living documents ever produced. Imagine what future generations will think when they watch this. / []
Third class, child rapist and sex addict. Time to get over the monarch family system / []
Will never be held to account for his sexual dalliance into pedophilia, being  a senior member of the British Royal Family he's protected from the general public. / []
I think he is lying / []
So many similarities of no accountability of the spares- no sense of self Or of us paupers. Too too funny AND the late HMTQ was correct- no one should do an interview- this guy😂 convenient and honorable - drink! / []
This Will go down in history as possibly the best interview in the 21st century. / []
The photo is fake, because he doesn't sweat at all 😅 / []
I just wonder if this is real or comedy 🤔 😅😅😅 / []
One of the best interviews ever made 😅😅😅😅, 👌 🙌 👏 😍 / []
He knows he is lieing he knows you know he's lieing and we all know he was walking the freaking plank ! Extraordinary !! / []
wow you can see right through him / []
Final conclusion, that FAKE accusser virginia roberts if ever that is her REAL name, should be tracked back, get those 40million back and aditional payment of 50 million for destroying Prince Andrew's reputation! How can people have such SHALLOW mentality to believe all this CLEAR MADE UP STORIES just to have some juicy gossips to entertain them. It does cost a lot of money, bad reputation and mental damage to victims! Where are the doctrines of good human values nowadays? Very SAD! For BIAS SOCIAL MEDIA! / []
My mum said since I'm a total history buff ( who's very into the dramatic stuff ), I'd find this interview fascinating. This is actually the worst/best thing I've ever seen. How did his guys give him the green light to say this stuff? It actually seems crazy that he just keot talking and it keot getting worse. / ['Second worst royal crash']
He proved his INNOCENCE with the fact he did NOT sweat as it was impossible for him to sweat / []
This interview is catastrophic for the Windsor house … / []
Stupid question again of maitis! How did he moved on in all this. Yeah right! All of it is NON OF HIS BUSINESS! So he can just move on back to his usual life! Like what maitis should do too!…🤣😂🤣…!…What a MORON!. NO affect on Prince Andrew because he has NOT DONE ALL THOSE STUPID NONSENSE ACCUSATIONS, ALL HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO HIM!…Emily maitis has family and love ones too! I wonder how all this LIES and her BIAS character affects to them!?!…🤣😂🤣…! / []
If it was you lady interviewer, you would'nt testify for Epstein either afterall the hospitality he had given to you if you were Prince Andrew! Again, the HYPOCRICY! NO COMMON SENSE! You emily maitis is known as a FAKE! Famous BIAS! Bringing DESTRUCTIONS to others! You should be in jail for this inappropriate behaviour! Shame in you! LOWLY WOMAN!.. That explains her STUPIDITY! Now i see what she's called!…😂🤣😂…!…I wonder how much she was PAID for all this!…SCANDALOUS WOMAN!…😂🤣😂…!…No wonder all those out  of the line questions as STUPID AS HER!…🤣😂🤣…!…Doesn't make any sense at all! She thinks she is very smart and PURE!…😂😂😂…! / []
I think the lady interviewer is lacking of sex! She kept on forcing it to Prince Andrew!…😂🤣😂…! / []
Message to so called virginia roberts, REPAIR ALL THIS LIES! Give back the 40million, Pay the penalty of 50 million, CLEAR Prince Andrew's name and live peacefully somewhere very far! Or strikes of BADLUCK only follows YOU horribly till your end! / []
See? It's purely SET UP! He does not remember any photograph ever taken because it was from a security cam.! That hand on her left side was EDITED! Or there must be some ghost in that boat who placed its arm arround that russiangirl's waist!…😂🤣😂…!...Yeah sure, legal, legal LIES!…🤣😂🤣…!…she had so called sex with him 3x! And it indicated she was forced all those 3x?!?…Yeah sure! Only STUPID PEOPLE will buy all this!…ABSURD!…if she was sent by Epstein, then it is Epstein's crime! NOT of Prince Andrew! He was just lured by this criminal man! / []
If the so called picture is a photograph over photograph and above photograph, then i's SURELY an EDITED ONE! / []
Who knows, that photo was taken on a hanging security camera on that boat!…😏🤨🙄…!…that's why he was unaware and no recollections about it! He was PURELY SET UP! By Epstein's criminal money chaser org.! / []
The way virginia described their VOLUNTARY night outs, she seemed to be enjoying it! NOT FORCED AT ALL! I believe Prince Andrew that he did not sweat. I am the type of person who easily don't sweat either! Unless 50 degrees!…🤣🤣🤣…!…The way the interviewer so called asking questions is like INTERROGATING him lie a lawyer already!…🫢🫢🫢…!…😂😂😂…!…Trying hard smart ass!…Trying to turn arround questions and manipulating events and words! / []
Why would you interviewer lady remember when and where you are going to the toilet?…😂🤣😂…!…Pitiful lady...Stupid question! / []
There's NO LOGIC AT ALL!… Besides, he was at home! Maybe his other ghost went with virginia out on those so called NON FORCED dates?!? / []
With him! How can she be forced!… ABSURD!… to the max! / []
All those LIES just to milk The Royal Family! He didn't even met her! If she does, she seemed to be enjoying dining and going out with him few times! How can she be forced when she kept on going with him!…ABSOR / []
The way the interviewer threw her words to Prince Andrew clearly showed that she already condemned him! I wonder what she felt if its the otherway arround! It is OBVIOUS that virginia roberts had been voluntarily going with Prince Andrew everytime! I CANNOT SEE ANY FORCED ACTIONS being DONE in this interview! They both are goin on dates! Having fun! She went with him even a few times! So how can it be that she is FORCED TO have sex with him??…Hello! People! Where are those common senses!… The good ones! Where are those good conscience! / []
The way the lady interviewed him seems to already know what she wants to believe to pin and accuse him more with all that LIES! How FAIR are these kind of DESTRUCTIVE reporters are!…Be GONE WITH THEM!…😡😡😡…People live in LIES just to entertain themselves. Go and watch FICTION MOVIES!..Look for hobby's that interest you! EVIL HYPOCRITES! / []
Lady interviewer asked STUPID QUESTIONS now and then! She has to ask those herself! Then she'll know the answer! How IDIOT! The HYPOCRACY! How can they accuse him of meeting and having sex with that woman when he did'nt even met her! How can people be so CRUEL! Pasting evil thoughts to others! He is telling the TRUTH! That picture in the yacth is very much different than that picture of the uglier one who pretended to be the one in the picture of MANY2 YEARS AGO! Come on! Only fools and deluded will believe in this crap! You wouldn't like it yourself if people will set you up like this! / []
This oaf is an embarrassment to our country and a real poster boy for a republic!  He is so thick that it is a crime imo that our hard earned taxes were spent on a luxury education for a person so feeble minded.  People like him and all public servants should come with a refund guarantee for the length of their employment.  Oh and don't worry Andrew you do not appear grand just trash as far as I am concerned. / []
Andy was so skilled in this interview.  ..........not - he's big fool......an idiot.  Any royalists want to support him???? / []
Skin bubbling fun awaits the child harmer. / []
This is absolutely beautiful to watch!! Just the fact that he SETTLED makes this interview a scam. What a joke / []
Amazing how he experiences so many memory lapses about certain situations and then have these vivid recollections of other rather arbitrary events 😂 Thick skinned indeed! / []
I'm watching this for the 1st time because I've been watching Eric Weinstein videos! WHAT THE ACTUAL F*CK!!? Such a blatant liar!!! / []
The Fresh Prince. / []
His explanation of why he met Epstein in NY to "break-up" then stayed 4 days at the place thereafter was the smoking gun. If they were not close friends you don't need to make a "face to face" break-up, then of course you don't stay with him 4 days. / []
HYPOCRITE interviewer!…He was OBVIOUSLY set up! Taken pictures UNAWARE with Epstein in the park! Must be taken from afar since the securities didn't noticed it either! Very ODD! / ['Are you a predator? Because you sound like one.']
One has to consider the circumstances of the situations too! Like why he stayed in that house inspite of what was going on with Epstein! She would exactly do the same as Prince Andrew if she was in his shoes, judging the flow of those actual events..Surely not to defame himself! He is NOT crazy! / []
She prefer to believe in the lies and made up stories about him rather than the TRUTH of which Prince Andrew EXPLAINED to her!…How FAKE people are! / []
The interviewer lady who is VERY PURE herself NEVER DONE any MISTAKES in her life is OBVIOUSLY PUTTING WORDS into Prince Andrew's mouth!… What a filty VILE woman! / []
This PURE people who judges and condemned him are NOT LISTENING TO HIS HONEST EXPLAINATION! How FAIR these PURE judges are! Only out for MONEY and JUICY manmade scandals! How LOW AND IGNORANT! / []
Funny thing is that, those who judge Prince Andrew are the ones who are VILE themselves! Out to DESTROY others because of JEALOUSY AND ENVY! PATHETIC EVIL PEOPLE! / []
People judge Prince Andrew without any concrete evidences too soon! They make up stories just to DESTROY others!… They would NOT LIKE it either if this evil deeds are all done to them! Are this people PURE?!?…🙄🤨😒…!…What a HYPOCRICY! and LIES! There goes FAIR JUSTICE!. I am sure that Prince Andrew was UNAWARE of the criminal activities of FRIENDLY Epstein! He would NOT be friends with him if he knew! He was just LURED into making friends with him by offering him some so called BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY! People would do exactly the same as him if they were approached by FRIENDLY CHARMING Epstein! without knowing his dark activities, his REAL background!…So clear all these LIES! People of DESTRUCTIONS! NOT a good example for the wellbeing of others and to the World!...How can you just accuse innocent people!?!… If this will happen to your siblings and loveones, you won't be happy either! / []
He is despicable. / []
Rest assured, Epstein is just the tip of the iceberg / []
Just keep digging buddy… / []
I can imagine the queen shouting at the telly a la Russell Howard. / []
Any time spent with Epstein was a disaster in the making. / []
Lying like a 16y/o teen who stole from the icecreamtruck. Pathetic / []
Except that neither this vid nor any other addresses what Epstein was all about. / []

Let us get this out of the way. You none Royal little Oikes just don't  understand this will all be forgotten and in the Firm forgiven, for we the Firm march ever onward. / []
The trap that was set should have positively been avoided. It goes to show how incredibly dumb the elite truly are. / []
Seems like Epstein liked to prey on men that aren’t naturally good with women and blackmail them. Whatever bees nest  that was brought open with him and his island wasn’t supposed to happen. / []
Greatest interview of the 21st century so far……what a car crash / []
This interview was a forensic PR exam.  Great job, a masterclass of an interview / []
If you thought Prince Andrew was bad, wait until you hear about Lord Mountbatten! The arrogance and ignorance of the British is aggravating isn't it. / []
This man is Royal he dont text an party smh put some respect On the Blood line / []
There are very few people in the world that are more full of shit than this man. / []

Rich man acting smart. He’s been trained to sound smart. But he’s an idiot. / []
If someone is innocent? They don't answer most questions with "I don't think so" He would have been better off not giving this interview. / []
if he has never been up the stairs in maxwells house, how the hell did he know that was the upstairs? / ['thats what I said!!']
he doesnt remember, he just doesnt remember, he has no idea how why etc, he really doesnt remember, having a foot massage, he doesnt remember meeting this girl the one with his hand around her waist, he doesnt remember anything, he is a piggin liar he has done everything hes been accused of, a disgrace to this country / []
Car crash.. / []
29:57 lol and his response “we wonder” who is we? 😂😂 / []
Prince Andrew, did you worry about this interview?  “Actually, I don’t fret-didn’t fret the the time” / []
A cosmopolitan group of perverts. / []
How Emily refrained from slapping this pompous prick across his smug face is unfathomable!! Having zero responsibility or accountability all his life shows. Arrogant and insufferable cretin. / []
THE MOST fascinating thing about this interview is that Andrews confidence in his own bullshit is off the charts! He thinks this whole thing is going smoothly and is completely chuffed to bits with it all. / []
Now I understand why lawyers tell their defendant's to say nothing. Wow, the absolute bs is piling up fast. He believes he can say anything and he will be believed. / []
I would never believe he was with his daughter, at some pizza place, because that was a memorable fact? Using his daughter to get off on abusing girls and hurting their fathers. The media says" young women"  being trafficked. These were young GIRLS. NOT WOMEN!  The 1 girl Andrew was saying goodbye to looked pretty young. And, the girl leaving with Epstein definitely was a young girl!!. / []
When I'm feeling low and life not going the best, I'll watch this interview and it always makes me feel better about my life😂😂  But prayers out to the victims. Just horrendous / ['Me too', 'Me three😅', 'Same 😂', 'Yup!@', 'i watch it every new year to laugh 😍']
He should be in jail / []
I'm sure the Royal family needs to stay in sex offender's homes because, well, it was convenient.  Poor Andrew.  He was once young, pretty and important.  His wife was young, pretty, fun and inspiring and you could see her and Princess Diana plotting and planning and live vicariously through them.   They've become old slags, just like that Queen of Sluts, Camilla.  Andrew screws kids, Charie screws a married woman while he is married man.  What a family to look up to!!  I fear Prince William is following in his father's footsteps.  Monarchy is simply an outdated and useless concept. God save the Queen!!!!! / []
Andrew is  no prince of any character, sorry have to blame Liz and Phil , the parents of entitled royalty, rules . / []
Come on, Andrew Knew Meghan, they both tried to LIE to Elizabeth R Queen of England. Karma will fall on both of them. They f. K.d each other, the world knóws they DID. Wake up World, / []
always worth a watch this   hahaha / []
They honestly should just dissolve their monarchy just imagine how much better life would be without them. Billions wasted on pomp and circumstance! This just shows how easy it is for someone with power to sexually assault anyone they choose with no repercussions. But this guy is literally a snake how does anyone in the royal family or in the UK tolerate this lol. / []
Send him The Bahamas out the way like where Uncle Edward 8th went as he was a  liability too a Nazi one...but don't forget everyone keep the silly little Royal flag waving going...  Get Real Everyone.. Wake Up People ..... / []
Joke! Abolish the lot of them.. / []
🙄💩 / []
This interview is an absolute disaster!!! / []
Please remember he doesn’t sweat lmao😅😅😅 / []
HE’S LYING!!! / []
It's ironic that an organisation well known for sheltering peds is getting on Andrew's case about hanging with a ped. Dear me / []
I completely understand that the girls were underaged and it does not give justification to the situation but where were these girls parents? And furthermore, even if they did not have parents why were they not contacting the police when it happened? Also, they had every opportunity to decline these activities and leave - no one was holding them against their will they voluntarily submitted to these acts. They were not kidnapped or held at gun point and I'm sure they had enough sense to know what they were doing was wrong. I really wish that the words "abuse" and ""victim" would be saved for people who really have been forced into horrible events with no option to flee or seek help. These young girls were doing a service in the exchange for money with every intention to submit themselves to discomfort. They are not victims they are underage sex workers who were doing an illegal service. / ["Damn you are right bro they gave consent that's why it all happened", 'They were trafficked. This was sex slavery.', '@LimeyLassen  slaves are held against their own will. These girls submitted themselves to these events for money.']
Why don’t you do a story on how Epstein is in the CIA and still alive? / []
his denial is stunning! / []
PRINCE ANDREW, I HAVE TO SAY, YR A TERRIBLE LIAR. / []
40:36 Interviewer: Epstein is dead… Prince Andrew: Yes (as he laughs in ______! Fill in the blank) / []
What a load of bs... How many times does a supposed innocent man say erm!! Pathetically inane and I can't imagine anyone believes this rubbish. If he wasn't who he is he'd likely have been convicted and be serving time with his mate / []
Epstein was murdered. / []
The prince is almost diaarmingly honest. A shrewder man would have dodged all the questions adroitly. / []
Interviewer: He was released from jail and 4 days later you were staying with him at his home.   Andrew: I have always been interested in those jail shows on TV. They are so cool. I wanted to hear Jefffrwy tell me some jail stories. Jeffrey is a great storyteller. / []
I always believe that Prince Andrew is a victim of a large n monstrous conspiracy. / []
What a complete IDIOT / []
You Brit’s are so stupid to have unelected jerkoffs like this and others.   Off with their heads join the modern age do these fuck jobs unite you fools? / []

WHY ARE THE EPSTEIN NAMES STILL SECRET? This is forkn incredible! / []
Notice how he tries to incorporate everyone in his entourage. He’s really using the royal “we”. / []
No one believes the 💩he is telling! / []
If lying were a poster child, this would be its face.  I have never seen someone lie with such ease while looking so  uncomfortable. / []

That definitely WASN’T you getting a foot massage from a Russian girl in Epstein’s house?  ☠️   She slowly, carefully turns a mutually agreed interview into a career-ending, public prosecution. / []

Am glad Prince Andrew straightened all that out, no bother looking at him, he is too honourable of a chap for that nonsense / []
What I do not understand is, why the girls did not leave this invironment? Where they forced to stay? / []
4 times a year 😂😂 / []
Andrew has never been the sharpest knife in the drawer,   but he really stabbed himself in the foot with this interview.   He denies sleeping with that young girlvat Guillaine Mwxwell ,s London home.  One person could verify the truth Andrews body guard.  He knows where he is at all times.   It is  so obvious he is  lying through his teeth. / []
man was stuttering like crazy 😂 / ['Most British ppl do king Philip had a bad one']
40:36  Interviewer : Epstein is dead Andrew : Yes 🤣 / []
He says, Epstein brought extraordinary people together; politicians! Why aren't they concentrating on that! / []
His tie is crooked. Makes him look distressed, off center.  Means he's on his own with no mummy, handlers helping him. / []
"If you are someone like me" in other words people wouldn't  do anything bad around me as I'm a great figure. Then he says I live in Buckingham Palace... which he doesn't.  Lives in Royal Lodge which has been said to have girls/women coming and going constanly. / []
The reason Epstein said you were on that island is that we share a birthday. He wanted to be in control of me, and my estate and it wasn’t going to happen . He claimed we were marrying- there was no I do. And if there was I’ve had amnesia for 55 years? No, you weren’t there.  Jeffrey Epstein is and was Steve Duncan Hunter. Tried to have me killed so many times so this wouldn’t get out. But I need to speak up. / ['Who is Steve Duncan Hunter?']
Like colonel Klink on hogans hero’s.   He knew nothing.  😊 / []
It’s so nice they came up with big suits and ties and all this to clean them up.  😀🤣🤣🤣👨‍⚕️. / []
😮😆🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫 / []
Notice how he laughs when Emily says "Epstein is dead".  This is such an insight into the shadowy world of the wealthy and privileged.  He use of "we" describes how he is supported by a corrupt system which lives above and beyond the law. The 'royal family' is an outdated institution. / []
If 'digging your own grave' was a person... / []

No. Nooo. No. Noooo no no no. LIAR, LIAR, PANTA ON FIRE 🔥 / []
Big applause for the interviewer, regardless of the case she allowed the person she was interviewing to talk and not interrupt that what the interview is all about. And then when she asked a question it was relevant well prepared and hit the mark. Well done / ["You're admiring the competence of  the interviewer,  but you can careless about the crime that was committed on minors by a member of the royal family."]
10:20 !!! What a buffoon / []
Andrew is no diff than MOST of the Royal Family.  It is just that he got caught.  The BEST MEMBERS of the Royal Family are Edward and family and Harry and Meghan.  All though the press are slamming Harry and Meghan, in time they will wish they had not done so. / []

Interesting, if JE wasnt a good friend, a very good friend or a very very good friend why would you feel the need to end this non friend friendship face to face?? Just call and tell him, unless theres more to the friendship or something had to be ironed out with no chance of email or phone call trace??  Anyone seen Little Britain??

In my opinion the interview  goes south when Andrew is evasive  on a foot massage, possibly  witness by a 3rd party. All he had to say I did not know what all went on at epsteins. It was just a simple  foot massage  Jeffrey  had masseuse. All I had was a foot massage, period.  However, this interview  gets worse and worse, and worse. The engaging in the speculation regarding  on Epsteins' death is bizarre. / []
1:54 I don't trust all of the "extra ordinary people" he is talking about. Every single one of them in the list are terrible people, even if we can't verify their involvement,  but the fact they went there, with the truth we now know what was happening, it's obvious they were all involved in child sex trafficking. Sorry but that is the truth. / []
That guy has a lot of issues.  Appearance matters, not truths. / []
This interview says it all about this entitled Moronic man / []
“Since Jeffrey’s suicide…”. Right, Andrew. His suicide. 🙄🙄 I guess, just like this interview was your own suicide. / []
whoope do 3 million people have a got a badge, what a parasite lying scumbag he is / []
“There was absolutely no indication …. and if there was …..”  I’m late in commenting. Prince Andrew might be the best looking of the Late Queen Elizabeth’s four children but, sadly, the least intelligent and intuitive of the four. / []
I've never been upstairs at Ghislane's house and that photo was taken upstairs.  How do I know that, just a guess. / []
I wonder how upset his mother was .  Certainly  very sad for her / ['Haha the queen is just as corrupt mate.. greedy royal people']
The timeline of events is very telling .. Prince Andrew ceasing contact with Epstein as he says 'after he was aware he was under investigation later in 2006' then in 2008 Epstein was found guilty and was jailed .. so now Epstein is a CONVICTED peodophile and Prince Andrew was still not in contact with Epstein. Then on Epstein's release within months he WAS in contact with him in 2010, staying in his New York Mansion .. why was it all suddenly okay to do that?  If it was okay not to be in contact with Epstein for all that time why resume contact?  Why not go through Ghislaine Maxwell to explain sorry but can't have anything to do with Epstein because of what's happened.  Why not even get the Palace Staff to do that? Then to go out in public with Epstein having said to tell him he could no longer have anything to do with him was why he went to see him just doesn't make sense.  Andrew says because he didn't want to take the chicken way out had to go see him face to face .. okay he did that in Epsteins house so why the walk in the park where everyone can see Andrew being WITH him? / []
I had to go see him to tell him to get rid of the tapes / []

In early 1100s if not mistaken the pope gave the order to execute all leaders of Knight Templars for committing these sin..Worshipping Idols, eating dust of the dead, devil worshipping, drinking blood, SLEEPING WITH YOUNG GIRLS AND IMPREGNATING THEM!, sacrificing the blood of the innocent or practically children!  Epstein also had a “temple” on his island with similar look to Israeli Flag. The honeypot side for controlling politicians..money..power is just one side of this whole thing. Theres spiritual perspective side. This is just one of their honeypots that got exposed. / []

Had heard of, but never seen this interview before... Unbelievable! The man is so far gone I guess he really believes he's "too honorable". Sorry the Queen gave birth to such a perv. / []
It’s funny how this man got away with this. He kept saying “I don’t recall or I don’t remember” but still no “I’d never ever engage in that type of thing” very PR answers and it’s so clear he’s guilty. / ['Hell he said he wouldn’t change being friends with the man']
😂 / []
Andrew's body language is gold during this IV. Emily's IV technique made this liar very uncomfortable. / []
So you need to tell a convicted sex offender that you can no longer be their friend in person these days? That makes perfect sense. As Andy himself says of himself he is just too honourable. Great interview Andy. You nailed it. / ['VOTE REPUBLIC UK ( NOT MY KING ! )', "\u200b@richardmurphy4520that's cause prince charlie of scotland is the rightful throne", '@FALKIRKHOOLIGANS1876 Trust you scrawled that on the window you were licking ..... ?']
The crazy thing is that she gives him SO MANY opportunities to express his regret but he just doesn't do it. Not even a little bit. He straight out says he doesn't regret his friendship with Epstein because of the useful opportunities he got out of that friendship. He seems so completely oblivious to how ridiculous or plain disgusting his answers are, it's truly painful to watch. / []
Why isn’t this guy in jail?????? / []
The laugh at 28:04 says it all really / []
Yea, all Reptilians have thick skin... / []
The fact that he blatantly contradicts himself is embarrassing. When he is talking about being well versed in the signs of SA and trafficking, and having the training to recognize all the red flags, he claims that in all of his memories there were no such signs. THEN later at 35:05 he literally says that he wouldn't have noticed because he wasn't looking for it. For someone who has been informed of what to look for he conveniently is so unaware of his environment. / []
How he is not blushing. Does he wear a concealer?? / []
He is as guilty as sin…this interview is laughable. When he was talking about the pizza express he grinned as if he was thinking “yes that was a brilliant lie.” 😂 I also don’t think Virginia is as innocent as she claims either tbh. She’s grinning from ear to ear in that photo and she lent Epstein the camera. / ["It doesn't matter if she is smiliing, she was a child and nothing justifies abusing a child. Blaming the victim suggesting she isn't innocent is disgusting", 'I had a friend (now ex-friend) who was a compulsive liar, extremely arrogant, and would never take responsibility for his actions, and blame anyone and anything else for his short-comings (basically an all round shit person with massive insecurities) and whenever he would tell a lie that he thought was super convincing, his facial expressions would just be like the ones seen by Andrew after the "oooh yes, I remember that.."\n\nHe\'s lying, and it\'s so obvious.', '@washingtonhome187yeah completely! An expert is not needed to determine if these people are lying because their facial expressions confirm their guilt.']

It’s as if he really doesn’t want to have to lie about these things, feel any shame or admit that any of it is wrong.   Like he really feels so entitled and is that arrogant he’ll childishly lie like a 5 year old caught eating sweets from the cupboard when he’s not allowed. “I couldn’t have been in a bar because I don’t drink” “I couldn’t have been dancing because I can’t sweat” like what?? “I would describe it as…” *continues to self diagnose a made up condition he has*. Madness. / []
He needs to draw a warm bath  just like the god father. 😮 You can’t be a man who has sex 3 times with a teenager ❤ And you were in charge to stop trafficking I hope you’ve been fired. 😮 / []
this interview was an ambush that did not work. it's beyond me why people make so much of it. / ["😂 What on earth, you're certainly an individual with questionable morals then. Don't be so quick to admit that."]
I have no vested interests here, but I think he's being honest, and the interviewer is being a see you next tuestday / []
Couldn't be anymore transparent if he tried 😂guilt written all over him / []
Two things that strike me about this, in addition to everything everyone else has written: 1) At 13:42 (I think), when the interviewer mentions the literary agent who was present and remembers seeing Prince Andrew there, he looks surprised, leans forward and says "really", which seems to indicate (to me at least) that he knows him. Yet once she's told him of the agent's testimony, he suddenly denies all knowledge of him. It's a very sudden volte-face. 2) The whole business about the photo: even if he wanted to deny sleeping with Virginia Roberts, making a thing about the photo possibly being fake is just stupid and he gets properly tangled up in it. Why not just say something like, "Yes that's me, yes that's a photo of me with her, which she asked for given I'm royalty. No, it wasn't a good idea in hindsight, especially with my arm around her; but a photo, even a photo like that, doesn't prove we had sex"? It's not a great line, but it's better than the "it might be faked" line which got him in even more of a mess. / ["He's so stupid 🤣🤣🤣", '13:52 He says no but he nods no meaning he did']

It was a "convenient place to stay" bro, your royal blood. Im sure MANY people wouldnt mind you crashing at their place. But he probably has enough money to go where he pleases. But if he wanted out then im sure someone wouldve been sent to get you. So it makes absolutely no sense. Then you remember he was there to "end the friendship" while doing "business" sounds to me like it was a last hoorah and it's disgusting. Since he could've called and achieved the same thing. But now I'm sure someone else has stepped up to fill Epstein's role. 😣   Epstein taking pictures tracks with what we know about him having lists and keeps proof of people visting him. So, when he gets caught he couldve took a bunch of people down with him.  But those darn cameras just had to stop working at a very peculiar time. Funny how that works, right? / []

This bumbling arrogant moron! He had all the resources in the world he could have crafted a perfect story but NO, he comes on an interview in front of the entire world and makes an utter fool of himself. This is the same attitude that had him believe he could do as he fancied and never get caught or he was above the law or MUMMY would come to his rescue,anybody with half a brain could tell he was obviously lying and a lousy liar at that…….he does not regret anything( he even says so in this very interview) it seems he is only mildly inconvenienced he got caught. I really pity the British public who have to pay tax money for this morons upkeep. / []
I don’t recall….but recalls specifically he was at home with the kids. This man is a lying cretin. / []
This man is trying to lead us to believe he had to travel thousands of miles just to spell out why he couldn't be friends with a pedophile anymore? I've ended friendships via text message over things that were far less self-explanatory. Breaks my heart on behalf of all of Epstein's victims to think that Prince Andrew will most likely never get his comeuppance. I physically despise him with all my being and I truly hope justice is served! / ['💯💯👏👏👏👏', 'Or just go ghost fym', "Proves nothing. He was just nervous. Wouldn't you be?

When I really don't want to be seen with anybody anymore I always choose the walk in the New York park.  100% works!! / []
This is a disaster 😂 / []
Este hombre miente, ahora no recuerda nada. Esta entrevista es su muerte. / []
what a piece of lying shit... / []
What a pathetic pathetic human being / []
I've never seen an interview that made me sure that this man was an evil man. / []
This honourable piece of shite must be relieved that Epstein’s dead. What he had on Randy Andy would bring the firm down. / []
Would love him to take a polygraph / []
He makes me want to puke. The whole family are fractured. The walk in the park was just that!! and because he was photographed he came up with the most ridiculous story that he was telling Epstein goodbye mate your a naughty boy. Then he goes back and spends the next few days there. Hes disgusting. And this stupid story that he doesn’t sweat 😂. Lol. He comes up with such stupid excuses and he thinks because of who he is he will be believed. Just like he has all of his life, hes surrounded by yes men. What a horrible piece of shite, he has no empathy for the young women who’s lives are forever changed. Im now laughing at his ‘ positive action ‘  making love its hard to forget a positive action.  😂 / []
Arrogant,pompous,evil,spoilt lying pri**!! How u hold up your head up so high is beyond me !!we see you for what you really are .,and even though you think youve got away with it ,the world still sees you for what your truely are !your daughters abd family must be so proud 🤢 🤕 🤮 / []
It's so clear that we are looking at a man that has a led a life of so much oncompromised privilege that he has no clue whatsoever about how to lie or cover up because he simply never had to.  The results would have been comedy gold, if the subject itself wasn't so horrific.  Because, and let there be no doubt, this man is an absolute monster. / []
This Lady did a fantastic job with her interview. So Professional. Enough Said on that. When asked that he could not know what was going on he couldn't answer  that one. Says it all. Guilty As Hell. Epstein was Murdered to protect others. Stevie in Fife. / []
Poor Andrew. His answers are too long and are not affinitive in saying “No, this is not true.”  Had he been better versed on short, precise, denials, he would’ve been more believable. For a worldly man,  he comes across incapable of denying anything. For example: let’s say a cookie is missing and his mother were  to just say “Andrew did you take the last cookie?” He would stamper around to say, “I don’t recall seeing a cookie. I know that’s the cookie dish but I wish I would’ve known there was a cookie there”. All which makes it sound like he ate the last cookie. Instead, he should’ve said: “no, I didn’t take the cookie “ Just my humble opinion. He doesn’t even appear to look prepared for the interview either. He needs a better team to help him prepare to answer succinctly.. in any future interviews of this nature. You can still tell the truth, but do it distinctly, and with brevity, and with conviction. Being nice during this interview, totally destroyed his credibility. I want to believe him, but like so many of the other comments, he doesn’t not come across believable for the reasons I outlined above. 😢 / ['Blah blah. He guilty']
Us investigators have been trying for make an appointment with Andrew for years now!!! SMH!!! He and the entire gang are known pedophiles!!! Prison then castration is what they ALL deserve!!!!! / []
Positive action..!! / []
Sleeze  pathetic  liar . / []
He lacks so much awareness..Doesn’t even know how to fake being compassionate…..The court jester / []
It's like watching a toddler learning how to lie / []
He was at it p o 🤣🤣 / []
If he "doesn't remember"...... how does he know it didn't happen 🤷‍♂?! / []
Well, Satan and Epstein will be waiting for him when he dies, / []
Ä.Ä,Ä.    I,l.  I.    bur,but,but.   no,no,no.   the.  ,the,the.  And,and,and.    I.   Dont.    REMEMBER.    anything.    Absolutly.    Not / []
Her interview skills are brilliant / []
I don't remember abusing young girls so that makes it ok ....is basically what he's saying / []
Makes my skin crawl vile man / []
The. Qestion.    are.     the.    royals.     super.    smart.    and.    diabolics.     ore.    deephly.    deephly.    stupid??? / []
This guy is lying about a lot of stuff, look at his speech structure and eyes. / []
I think he has no recollection 🤔 / []
So he is still working  with young people. That's a joke. / []
He is sooo sick😢 / []
The definition of liars.He’s guilty. / []
Am I right in thinking that you threw a birthday party for Ghislaine .. No, it was a straightforward shooting weekend where we shot a few children and foxes.. ahem I mean Grouse ! .. Tim Nice but Dim !! / []
Well, it was a convenient place to stay,? and by staying there for four days after the so-called “dinner party “I had learned so much from the many associates, and his acquaintances.?  I have never seen a snake put so many feet in his mouth at one sitting.  Actually, I’m relieved that he can’t sweat because it would be too painful to watch this interview in full!! / []
How on earth can he avoid justice? A sincere flaw  in the justice system. Such an arrogant idiot escaping justice. I don’t understand why people like him think they are above the law. His tendency to be too honourable. I would say his tendency to be a flawed character. Hurting especially the royal family / []
Interviewer - Emily Maitlis: “She says that she had sex with you .. 3 times.” Prince Andrew: “Well there’s a slight problem with that, you see, I don’t have a penis”. / []
"She said that she had s*x with you three times, once in a London house...." "Yes......." 29:35. / []
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen / []
I feel so sorry for the queen. This prick and her crybaby grandson are poisoning what the poor lady dedicated her life to building. / []
He considers himself and the other pedophiles “extraordinary”. / []
He couldn’t have done a worse job at explaining himself. / []
Love this seriously.  i feel like I am a big looser Watching this made me feel better 😊 / []
Use ur left magic finger so u can lie easily. / []
What a joke ur ayeness. Shame on u. Sympathy for ur daughters. / []
Prince Andrew should have think many times before befriending Eipstein..He is a member of the Royal & should kept himself away from this notorious pedophile Eipstein / ['Same for Charles.. Except he chose Jimmy Savile who was a lot more well known as a child rapist, but it never stopped him.. it probably was the attraction to tell you the truth. Because it seems to me that wealth and power can turn people evil.']
“I need closure just as much as everyone else.” Holy shit I’ve never seen that part / ['Incredible.', 'Thanks']
Ok, I can't stand the lying. / []
Hahahaha sorry but it is so funny hahahah / ['@TheMaximumj why shall i ? Hahah im just watching😂']
The RF sure has their share of scumbags. They should all go out and get a real job when they’re that far from the throne. / ['And what have you done about it?!', '@TheMaximumj Silly childish comment.. What do you expect him to do about it ? .. I suppose you think he should stand outside the Palace with a placard saying Andrew is Innocent !!', "I've said the same thing all my life.. they are nothing but leeches and ribbon choppers. I would put the lot of them in a potato field to pick spuds and they would get a crust of mouldy bread and treacle as payment"]
😢 / []
is this guy a jerk or what? / []
Good Lord what a gross disgusting person. Makes me ill just listening to him talk. 🤢 And the hilarious thing is, he thinks he’s clever and convincing us that he’s completely innocent. Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!!! 🙈🙈🙈🙈 / ['I totally agree.. he is a sickly sinister person who made a fool of himself.']
Does he stutter this much? While lying he can never lie easily. / []
A hard ---- has no conscience. Anyone else grow up with this expression? / []
A straight forward shooting weekend? As if its jus a "normal" everyday thang? / ['And what have you done about it?!']
😂😂 GO ANDY! / []
i can tell just by his body language he is full of sht / ['@TheMaximumj I spoke about it']
'Bet that he's sweating now! ...after this journalistic disaster of the millennium! / []
Selective memeory. / []
Thank you for taking the time to get these stories out to us :D   <333 / []
Emily: "She made these claims in a US deposition. Are you saying you don't believe her? She's lying?" Andrew: "That's a very difficult thing to answer..." No, it's not. It's a simple question that requires a simple answer. An innocent person would say, "Yes. She's lying." Andrew is guilty as fuck / []
I’ve never heard such a bold faced liar . Kick him out of England!!! He is a mooching bum!!!! / []
If he never spoke. EVER. He would be in an okay spot. Only one comment. ‘Too bad my previous friend turned out to have fooled many including myself. Nothing more to say about the subject. Peace to all. I love you all and to all you believing in me, thank you. To everyone else. I love you too.’ Something like that. Would work on wording it out in a short precise way and never again speak of it then Andrew would today not be the laughing stock of the whole planet. Just some speculation, but nothing huge. / []
😂😂😂😂 pants on fire / []
100% Guilty / []
A royal narcissist who buried himself 100% on that fateful date of that historic interview. / []
They say he treated staff like CRAP. Karma is catching up to him. / []
Liars always get found out / []
PA: 4 times a year? are you mad?  BBC:Oh Pardon me, it says here,,, 4 HUNDRED times  PA: Ah, quite right,  That is a a much more accurate representation of the number of times I went to get a "massage" / []

I expect Andrew will be arrested for having sex with a trafficked minor? No I thought not! / []
We can go ahead 😀 memorial for the 👑 queen and wonderful prince Philip 💐❤ not blaming Andrew and Epstein Jeffrey for the actual 📛📛📛📛📛📛 name of what happened in ☠️ the 👑💖 George king 👑 Henry 5 is awesome Henry 8 awesome thanks, not to blame for sexual  woman 👠💋😘 women stuff powers and wonderful friends celebrate 🥂🎆 prince William and Andrew are in the future for the king 👑 Charles qwenn Elizabeth miss, best wishes but, king 👑 Charles brother is Andrew prince , maybe not guilty of any reason not to be stripped 😭😭😔 in life 😂❤, awesome amen 🙏. / []
questions without being interrupted. / []
DISGUSTING / []
Nice guy lol / []
If he didn't do it why not sue her for slander! I would exspecially if I lost jobs, deals, and titals from the NAVY!😮😮😮 / []
he is so arrogant, am I surprised no / []
Disgusting / []
That tie looks like it’s getting tighter and of course the sweating rubbish is dog shit because that mofos sweating now / []
The over exaggerated facial expressions are golden,  it’s beautiful / []
Don’t know about passing in the passage but you definitely joined him in coming up her passage and probably his passage as well / []
This is disastrous / []
BBC Bias is quite visible the way they attacked Tate and here we see we feel sympathy for the crime you committed at private island and charged 😉  Pedophile Andrew getting heard his lies 😅 / []
he even looks like a reptile / []
People like him think everybody else is stupid. Wow! / []
This interview is pointless, he played the media… what has happened to him since then… nothing. And nothing will. These scumbags. / []
“Keep your commitment’s respectful”? He doesn’t deserve respect / []
trump was epstein's best friend, up to the minute he had him...um...erased. / []
The interviewer did such a good job / []
What an arrogant,obnoxious, entitled turd. News Flash Andy its your hand & saying You've never been upstairs at Ghislaines because that picture was taken upstairs at Ghislaines.....what the What !!! It was fun seeing him bury himself . How horrible for her majesty th Queen. I think we all know he was stripped of all his titles etc. Shortly thereafter / []
😅😅😅 i had to end a friendship by staying at his house and walking with him / []
He nearly choked when the interviewer asked "would you testify under oath?". Guilty as hell. / []
my god this is my first time watching this.. The guilt is dripping everywhere!! Need a clean up crew. Like he's placed with a soft toned gentle woman conducting interview in the most chill calm way and he is a bundle of nerves. tripping up all over why has this man not been jailed :O So sad this Scun will never be convicted  with all the photos videos anything never will anything be done. disgusting / []
He’s lying. / []
Sad to seee how someone of his stature be able to get away with his sick mind . So shameful for the royalssssssss / ['Tip of the iceberg I’m afraid!']
Lmao the contradictions!!!!!!! He acts as if he barely knew Epstein only bc of the connection with Ghislaine, yet he felt the need to end the relationship with him in person?! After his release?? An honorable man would have ditched him after the first allegations. He stayed at his home in NYC for days and saw people coming and going constantly but never found anything suspicious?!! Didn't queen mummy teach you never complain, never explain? What a doofus. / []
Andy you are guilty o f sex sex sex with a minor 17 yrs old  minus 40 equals  you sir are a pedifile  she should have gone to the police .but that got taken care of right Andrew. Money how much did you pay for sex with this child. Shame on you . And don’t say you don’t Remember a picture with a minor d&a will get you sooner or later. / []
ANDREW  FIX YOUR TIE  IT'S CROOKED " Just like you!😮😢😂 / []
Pure lies and face of guilt utter nonsense / []
no iD.EA  i dont look like Prince Andrew / []
Holy smokes - I saw snippets of this during the Netflix docuseries, and it was bad, but I had no idea it was *this* bad. / []
What a moron 😂 / []
Before this interview  I love know what he was thinking, / []
Funny how they don't interview him like andrew tate / []
ANDREW TOUCHES KIDS / []
Wow, no words / []
Overdose of adrenaline from being shot at making him not sweat, priceless 😂 / []
You are guilty / []
You're a coward lad 😠 / []
The contacts were a little young, surely that comes before convenience. / []
that is why the French guillotined their royalty / []
a royal liar / []
if he didn’t do anything wrong why oh why has he gone dark!!?? BULLSHIT!!! / []
bullshit alarm going off the charts / []
All the body language experts are saying this man is lying and squirming in his chair / []
He said “ Einstein had the ability to bring extraordinary people together “. Wink wink. He dry snitching on everyone else. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Prince Andrew, just another elite pedophile! / []
I focused about the life of Prince Andrew February 2, 2022. So the item earlier . / ['I encounter this item again']
This video shows you a true reflection of Britain. Do what i say not what i do!    Another example of the "elite" being able to do whatever the fuck they want!    Worst of all... who done anything about it? Absolutely noone!!    Why do we even live by the rules now??!!    The peole have the power, the people have always had the power however they habe let yous buy houses n led you all to beleive you have something to lose!!    They want our homes then they will take them by way of the banks!!   The housing market was a way to keep the people in check! / []
At least justice was served. His nonna paid a fine with the publics money. / []
OMG, did not realise how bad this interview was. This fella is an idiot. / []
ACDC - Got you by the balls / []
His judgement was "clouded "by the need to  get his story fixed? / []
I winder if he went to see him to get his story straight😊 / []
Im pretty sure there was a full fire team on stand bye? Pants on fire?😅 / []
just another ROYAL PHEDOPHILE blue blood / []
Ah yes, he doesn’t sweat, doesn’t breathe, doesn’t walk, and doesn’t sin  I don’t mind his earthly transgressions, I mind him lying / []
Easily the biggest mistake any monarch has ever made on TV. / []
Only an idiot would believe this perverts story.  Just his answers and his body language tells you he is lying.  Only he believes what comes out of his mouth.  He may not remember because she might of not been the only minor he assaulted. / []
I’m so happy he decided to do this interview.  Without it, we might still not know what a disgusting, perverted old man he is. / ["Proves nothing. He was just nervous. Wouldn't you be? Innocent till proven guilty!", "He's been  perverted most of his life. Thinking!", '@fatpigsflybearsIs this the Honorable Prince Andrew’s fake account?', '@leonardmulrooney3806 no absolutely not', '@fatpigsflybearsI agree innocent until proven guilty … but he does nothing for his credibility in this interview as he is caught lying on several occasions (for example, there is a photo of him upstairs and yet he continues to say “I never went upstairs”).  Nervous or not … the truth doesn’t waver.   But in his case, the truth is wavering.   So while this doesn’t prove guilt, it does raise the likelihood that he is trying to hide the truth. And this the begs the question, why would one try to hide the truth?']
People may think I'm crazy, but I find Andrew quite interesting. I wonder if he has a sort of disorder medical science haven't discovered yet. He is educated in the Navy so he is hardly dull. Yet on the same time he shows NO sense of judgement and he has a 360 degrees blind angle. Royal commentators say he is entitled and very aware of being a special person - a prince. I wonder who is to blame for this. People who have met Charles, Anne and Edward say they're all perfectly polite and charming. If that's true, the queen and prince Philip must have done a good job raising their children - considering that no parent is perfect.  So why is Andrew like that? He is said to have been the queen's favorite son. Yet that alone cannot explain or justify Andrew being the way he is. / []
There was no indication apart from the the girl he supplied me / []
And he gave her 12 million and is still a free man / []
Also look at the amount he is shrugging and fidgeting a lot, playing with his own fingers and more body tells.  I would be shocked if it came out he was telling the truth.  He is 100 per cent under stress answering the questions. / ['What’s he actually guilty of?', '@TheOlzee forcing himself on a trafficked minor!', '@geoffbirchall7552 she was of legal age and there’s no evidence he new she was trafficked.', '@TheOlzee sorry, 18 is legal age for USA and for Uk if the person is of a particular position of trust. \n£12,000,000 paid out to the victim, he knew exactly what was going on!', '@geoffbirchall7552  you’re a liar though. Legal age in U.K. is 16 and New York (where it was claimed to have happened) is 17.']
He is showing all the signs in his body language of telling lies.  Look at the amount he blinks when answering for instance. / []
HE IS A .w.a.n.k.e.r. and a p.e.d.o.p.h.i.l.e. ❤ oh and a  .b.i.g  .f.a.t.. .f.i.b.b.e.r. / []
Just noticed, in the final 0.1 second, the beginning of a broad smile on his face, as in, "boy, I'm glad I've put all questions to rest!  What a relief i won't have THIS spot of bother to deal with any more!  I'm so glad i agreed to this interview." / []
This is so perfect, from beginning to end.  What a gift! / []
I swear, all he had to do was answer the questions and say no more, he just can’t stop incriminating himself 😂 / ['he may have been giving coded messages']
What a tosser. / []
I'm a royal ..I simply don't sweat / []
МОИ МОЛИТВЫ С ВАМИ , УВАЖАЕМЫЙ  PRINCE ANDREW.  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏✨👑🌳👑✨🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
Actually this is the first time I have seen this interview, what an arrogant liar, sorry he had every knowledge of the goings on in that evil house (Allegedly). / []
How is it that NOBODY in this man's "Circle" didn't stop Andrew from doing this interview?  Like NOBODY??? This is as CRINGE as CRINGE Can be!!  Like Come on Andrew! WTF were you thinkn Mofo! 😮 / []
Unbecoming / []
Shame on you and the royal family that protects a child abuser who belongs to the jail. / []
by a single look at his face , he's guilty / []
If he were not from the royal family,he would be in jail for 40 years, there is no justice when it comes to royal families, former presidents, like Bill Clinton , trump , bill gates and so on......, that's the hypocrite western so-called free world. / []
The most viewed news / []
You realsise there all paedophiles  And have serious issues  The royal family is corrupt / []
Another royal brainless idiot 10:40 / []
He should teach Trump how to do his hair. / []
Is he known to be a stutterer? I don't think I've ever heard him speak before. / []
This is the first I’m watching this and it’s puzzles me 😅 does he think he’s telling the truth?? Not even half way through and I hear contradictions in his account of what this friendship he had with such an evil and vile man / []
Epstein did not deserve his unhappy suicide     and Gislaine should be freed. The hypocrisy in this world defies belief! Many of us phantasise about the James Bond lifestyle    Hugh Hefner lived it! Many Many men would not turn down a massage from a nubile young woman     hence the popularity of Thailand! Dishonesty is the reason these people were condemned    dishonesty of the guilt ridden accusers! / ["suicide? You're probably the only person on this planet that believe that he killed himself."]
Andrew: "That photograph was taken upstairs." Also Andrew: "I have never been upstairs." Hilarious! / ['I thought that, but tbf in the photo he’s leaning on the bannister so you can see it’s upstairs. I still think it’d be easier to lead with “I have never had sex with her” than “I’ve never been in that part of the house”', '@willmc4403Does it even matter what he says? This man(child) will never be punished for any of his deeds. Going back to visit Epstein shows that he is a deviant. He and the royal family will live with the burden of shame but they will survive.', 'If he had been in Maxwells house a bunch of times he would probably know if the background in the photo was upstairs or downstairs. To me, that’s not a “gotcha” moment like you’re insinuating.', '@foxtrotthree569 it is if the two statements he gave were clearly contradictory as implied.']
I'd have conducted this interview in a sauna with him sweating his ass off, you'd know he was talking shit straight away. / []
He took leadership he couldn't walk a blind man up an alley / []
He wasn't sure the police was investigating Epstein what else could it be such a stupid dork. / []
How does someone pay millions to someone he doesn't know what a dense thicko he wasn't clever enough to go to university. / []
She never asked him if he knew Mr Brockman even if he didn't brockman knew Randy Andy. / []
This is still the funniest video on YouTube. So many laugh out loud moments!  It never gets old. / ['thanks']
The fact that he chokes on his own words means that he is lying everything for sure👌🏻 / []
Yeah you get chucked out of the royal family,explain that? / []
Interview him more BBC. If this was andrew tate you would’ve done 100s of interviews / []
The handlers of BBC went to that island as well. Don’t BS Us BBC. / []
What a lying fuck! / []
🤢🤢🤢 / []
In the future they will make Andrews nose grow during the interview. / []
How does Andrew get all the way to the end of the interview without expressing ANY concern for Epstein’s victims! / ['Because they are his victims too.', "He doesn't care"]
I believe him. He is being himself and he is being honest.  If he were telling lies his answers would make more sense and he would say exactly what needs to be said.  This is out of character to be giving such an interview and perhaps he was a bit nervous.  But the world wants to believe he is guilty because of his privilege and status.   The woman is a gold digger and extortionist! / []
Becky from Coronation street an interviewer now / []
Love that I'm not the only one revisiting this treasure. I appreciate BBC for never turning off this comment section. Let's continue to keep this case alive that way! Some moments that stood out to me during this revisit, this interview is just pure gold:  10:16 the way he corrected himself from "what I was doing" to "what he was doing" 15:28 "the fact of the fatter is" 16:41 his answer to the question if he regrets his friendship with Epstein (summarised but literally his words): "I still not, for the reason being that the people that I met because of him were actually very useful." you know his subconscious isn't thinking about business partners 17:16 just one of multiple times he tries to justify his whereabouts by saying he was there because of Ghislaine. Oh I see, that makes things so much better :') 27:43 "I can absolutely categorically tell you that it never happened" while also insisting that he has no recollection whatsoever, but oh, that's specifically the part that he does recollect and it's true :') 29:31 the confidence in his "yes" and realising it  36:32 is he willing to testify under oath: in his words he would be "duty bound to do so" (just one example of his ambiguous answers) 38:21 scornfully laughing when recalling the death of his friend and continuing to calmly describe what his inflictions were found to look like 40:35 about the same thing as previous     His most nervous and unsure moments are equally as funny as the moments where he seems to feel most confident. The fact that he's still out and about like nothing happened is such an insult to this undeniable display of accountability. I'm eternally grateful for how professional and decisive Emily conducted this interview, it's iconic and unforgettable. / ['The words "pizza" and "adrenaline" are most significant', 'Vote Republic UK ( Not My King ! )', 'Any “normal” person would have been in prison by now, or at the very least, arrested.  Boils my blood 😡', 'HOOOOOW could he get away with this, HOW??', "He wouldn't  know honorable  if it bit him in the ass"]
Prince Andrew does not regret his time spent with Epstein because of what he learned? He makes Epstein sound like some magical enigma. / []
"If you're a man it's a positive act to have sex with someone" Wtaf?! / []
Is was an 'Honorable thing to do' for his private secretary to affirm with him... "You did great, your royal highness" after this very interview wrapped  ;) / []
I wonder how many of the critics have ever been to Thailand? If men did not fancy the ladies it would be a dull world    and many ladies willingly chase the rich and famous! How many men do not dream about the James Bond lifestyle? I bet many do. The girl in the photo was smiling from ear to ear   hardly traumatised! I think our Prince had a good time, a taste of freedom and so what! The accusers were gold diggers I think     the sort of kiss and tell opportunists! They had already been earning money by plying their trade! I really think the whole scenario is a lesson learnt and a warning to any men lured in to flesh pots. / []
Look at this interview vs the one for tate, why cant the bbc be consistent! Had to hi / []
A born liar who, appears to couldn't care less / []
“You stayed at the home of a convicted sex offender.”  “It was a convenient place to stay.”  Absolutely insane. / ['He doesn’t sweat because he’s a real life living pig', 'In cahoots', 'Yeah, he\'s royal blood. I\'m sure he could\'ve got a place in the same town where he was "doing business"  or if he wanted out I\'m sure he could\'ve left. So it makes absolutely no sense. Then you remember he was there to "end the friendship" sounds to me like it was a last hoorah and it\'s disgusting. Since he could\'ve called and achieved the same thing. But I\'m sure someone else has stepped up to fill epsteins role.', 'VOTE REPUBLIC UK (  NOT MY KING ! )', "Just over analyzing it here, he did say he didn't know he was charged at the time. I feel like he was telling the truth- unpopular opinion indeed."]
I want to throw up on him. Disgusting rat. / []
He first says he and Epstein weren't really friends, that he was friends with Ghislane.  Yet, he felt the friendship important enough to personally go to Epstein's to break up with him.  Hmmmm..... / []
19:04 Timestamp Pizza Story, for everyone looking for it🤫 / []
He's fine individual / []
He was stuttering a lot. Looked like he was trying to hide something. Definitely not the behaviour of a squeaky clean history. / []
Why didn't they send Emily to interview Andrew Tate instead? She's very professional, not like Lucy who came in with agenda.  Interview would've gone better. / []
Greatest train wreck ever! I’m just sad no one asked him about the time in the Falklands, when he was on a ship and it was getting fired at. He told them not to worry because his mother was the lord protector of the realm, head of the Church of England, and they wouldn’t get hurt as long as he was there. Mummy made him immortal and invincible apparently (very reliable source) / []
So scary how closely affiliated the royal family are with nonces and rapists. / []
There is a world of difference how they approach Prince Andrew & Andrew Tate. The BBC is desperate and it’s so obvious when it comes to tate. Exactly so sad I don’t know why they do stuff like that. The Epstein problem is very big and dark. While Tate’s allegations are not sure even now. Like even if your not a Tate fan atleast let him tell his story and let him talk and let the people judge just like this interview. Be objective, that’s why we loved the bbc back in the days… / []
Pompous twit is that Prince Andrew. / []
In hindsight we now know it was the princes good friends Maxwell who was procuring under age girls for Epstein and friends….as it were 😂 / []
What an idiot not the full quid / []
I’m here watching this after some lady compared the Andrew Tate interview to this. I don’t see the similarity. / []

You would expect to hear "how did we not realise?", "if only we had found out so we could've helped those poor girls" "could I have done something?" Andrew refuses to take any accountability, even the accountability an innocent person has. There is no way he is innocent. His body language is also so guilty. When he says he didn't do it he is nodding yes. When he says he doesn't sweat he is shaking his head no. He also clearly still likes epstein by the way he talks about him. This is why the royal family don't do interviews 😂 / ['Exactly. He shows no sympathy and he never positively denies meeting a 17-year-old; he consistently says "I don\'t remember" because he\'s afraid more photos will come out.', 'Uma vergonha deveria tá preso.']
Dog / ['You?']
so you 'went to see him' to say 'I can't be seen with you????" OHHH DEAR.... / []
Honorable My eye." More like dishonorable ." / []
Wow. / []
Andrew Tate is targeted as the most negatively influencing person on the planet and Prince Andrew is let free after raping kids on Epstein Island. / ['Prince Andrew is a great man.']
Would he actually be so stupid as to allow himself to be photographed in those circumstances? / ['Yeah, it’s supposedly her camera so to pose for a pic with a victim on their camera doesn’t make much sense']
Highlights the obscene entitlement of the upper classes who think they can brush off their behaviour as acceptable when it clearly wasn't. Totally out of touch with reality. / []
People aren't as stupid as u think. All life's. PIG / []
That picture was taken upstairs, and I've never been upstairs 🤔 / []
Thick as a Brick / []
"My tendency to be too honorable".... " I had to take a leadership role" " my staff, my people and I" 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 / []
Remember, one of his daughters is in the room during this debacle....the most astoundingly STUPID HUMAN BEING.....and it crops up here....divorced Sarah, yet she still lives with him....🤷‍♀️ / []
Usually watch videos on 1.5x speed but this time had to watch this normal speed too see the facial movements of a known sociopath in action. / []
Prince Abdrew should have  confered with a lawyer before the interview. / []
Oh my God / []
Oh my ,there are pictures from the night club . / []
In typical TCAP fashion, he went to his house to tell him he wasn’t coming to his house. / []
I believe him. / []
Im wonder why didnt he get jail because of his dirty past with teenage girls? / []
You can tell when he’s lying he moves his lips / ["He's kinda cute tho"]
Oh my heavens, right off the start, he’s unfortunately moronic. Why would anyone say they are friends with a criminal? / []
Why didn’t one of his handlers come in and rip him out of that chair? / ['Because they were with ur mom']
Note that he never says he did not do it! He just says he does not remember. / ["Whoa!! He's clever. I like him."]
If there’s such an overwhelming amount of evidence against a supposedly big amount of people as is suggested how come there is no other big names accused to me the whole sordid affair stinks to the high heaven. / []
andrew Windsor aka #PrincePedophile / []
Stumbling over words having to think too much. / []
Three years later I know the case because of this video. / []
Omg i just cant watch. Hes ridiculous / []
Bullshit at its best.  Cant pissibly be that ignorant / []
13:42 Tells you everything / ["He's awesome!! So cool!!"]
Such a let down of a human. Such a person of privilege who completely abused that privilege in the worse way possible.   Party prince 🤴 yes even fergie showed the same party...ness trouble.   Boy he seems to forgotten he has 2 beautiful daughters a similar age as the girls he abused / []
No wonder the late queen kicked u out of the Royal family should call u Billy. BILLY BULL SHITTER / ['She kicked him out because she was afraid he would pop her in the back']
The people don't know me at all.Dennis know it's no marriage and judge Joe brown begging know that. / []
Shit why Erma got Dennis Sr from over there why I'm not worried about judge Joe brown begging self. I've made my income in America and I'm done that they tried to steal my life Erma has shared with judge Joe brown begging self. / []
That's Erma husband she ran away dewhite daddy. / []
It's insane that he basically got away with it unscathed. All of those involved - the names seen in PDFs of the black book - all got away with it. The world got a glimpse into the underworld of what goes on in the lives and communities of the ultra rich. And nothing happened. No protests, no backlash beyond social media, nothing. / []
What a liar. / []
Liar and criminal, end of! / []
It is shocking that he ruined his wonderful, rich life to be a pal to a paedophile...  how the cookie crumbles. / []
It is shocking that he ruined his wonderful, rich life to be a pal to a paedophile...  how the cookie crumbles. / []
This man he had a judgement call nah im sick asf / []
Lock him up 🥴 / []
💀 this is wild / []
yes     yes     yes     yes / []
What I find so amazing is that he has no empathy  for the girls Epstein had going in and out of his home / []
Bullshit, just to malign dignitaries.Feminism is good but don't sacrifice celebrities on the altar of feminism. / []
He is a bumbling idiot without shame, honour, self respect or the ability to be honest. SHAME ON YOU ANDREW! / []
What concerns me is that this "prince"- this man" is still working with young children. / []
Liar, liar, pants on fire! / []
Abolish the monarchy and compost the rich. / []
"My judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honorable. But that's just the way it is."  Sorry? Words fail me here. / []
He is too guilty of sex offences. He is a royal with a tainted life. A liar. Harry is million times better. / ['No. This guy is the best in the family.']
This guy is terrible liar / []
What a jerk / []
Pedofile … im sick of watching his lying expressions and the way he is talking blushit ! / []
Came back here to watch this trainwreck interview again 🤦‍♂️ / []
He yammers on and on. / []
looking at all the sick smut you see in the world today, maybe he threw himself or was ordered to show the world that the royal family stand for it. For all we know, he could be mi6 as a spook, and that could be why it came to light. He might be telling the truth. If there are hundreds of underage girls in buckingham palace, why would ho have to go through jeffery epstien. / []
Still not seeing a lot of majestic highness. Maybe I'm not honorable enough. / []
it is astounding how he can remember some events and be totally oblivious to the to the obvious. / []
Poor Prince! What a fool he looked! You don’t paid some one 10,000.000 million that you don’t know! Get you stuff together and be a true gentleman to admit whaT you did! He has two daughters! / []
Andrew is a babbling idiot!! / []
Freudian slips all over the place... / []
Um no.  Look into the Jimmy Savile story. / []
Galin maxwell was the daughter of a Russian billionaire who tried to buy the rights to Tetris and lost out to Nintendo. He squandered his fortune leaving maxwell and her brother nothing. / []
Damn.. He’s a classic psychopath 👀 / ["He's not, not a good enough liar", 'He a great human being']
Royal vampire / ['Who? Jesus? Yeah he turned water into wine. That vampire']
MAKE HIM TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST!!!!!!! HES A COWARD & A FOOL!!!! EMILY NAIKED THE INTERVIEW . HE'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WINGGLING  & SQUIRMING & STUTTERING!!!!!! LIAR LIAR LIAR.  I BELIEVE THE YOUNG WOMAN & NOT HIM . VICTIMS OF ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL ABUSE KNOWS  THAT ACT STEALS THEIR   INNOCENCE AND  THAT CAN NEVER BE REGAINED AGAIN!!! / []
If someone made a claim about me  my first thought wouldn't be "Oh thats a bit strange" !  I would be bloody outraged if i was innocent and doing all i could to clear my name...doing a disposition would be no sweat!   As far as I'm concerned...He is guilty by association at best and outright guilty at worst. / []
Let’s also understand that he keeps referring to his time in the Royal Navy – a clear attempt by his PR team to play on the veteran sympathy of a man who “served his country”. Appalling. / []
right, odds on it was andrew who killed jeffrey / []
Wow. What a tool. / []
Pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile, pedophile / []
Yes…only a SHOOTING WEEKEND…we all had water pistols aimed at the lit candles around her birthday cake.. / []
See what happens when cousins marry? / []
King's brother! Pay for the monarchy.  They will take all the privileges and the money to party, to get out of trouble and to escape responsibility. Rat hole 🕳 / []
He is too honorable. 😅 To be in a convicted sex offender's house is an honorable thing to do. Such a rat from the castle. / []
'I don't think it's appropriate that we should keep contact' what an imbecile! No: 'Im disgusted in what you did and I refuse to have something to do with such a rat'... no ..he can't be in touch because people are talking.. what a detached from reality liar. / []
Bollocks / []
Book him Danno ! / []
An accomplished comedy writer couldn’t have constructed this with any more comedic absurdity. It’s masterful. / ["it's not really  funny, pizza was code for trafficked children (remember pizzagate?) and adrenaline is the reason why vampires drink blood.. when the victim is terrified at the time of death"]
LOTS OF MEN IN HISTORY HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF OPPORTUNISTS WOMEN... / ["Prince Andrew is a good man. He likes children too much though. But that's not a problem."]
I like to pull this video up every now and then when I’ve done something stupid or embarrassing so I feel better about it / []
Andrew you were looking to hook up with a teenager and thought that you would never be caught because you are Royalty. / []
To think that people are not smart??????? Boy is he the idiot of the Royal family. / []
grave dug.... what a PUKE / []
Bringing academics,politicians etc together.  He left out trafficked children. Silly sausage. / []
Was epstein at sandringham when that young european girl was found unalived? a while back? / ['alisa dmitrijeva.']
Even if this interview is older, this non-remembering reminds me of our federal chancellor Scholz and this innocent dachshund look reminds me of our economics minister Habeck. 😅😅😅 / []
Hes a beast an absolute wrong un / []
Andy. POS... / []
When all your friends have gone to prison, and you're the only one left . . . / []
This video is "Exhibit A" why criminal defense attorneys don't want their clients testifying. / []
21:20  At least he's finally able to sweat. / []
Wow what at a terrible person!! He is deep in trouble.. this so calling “prince “ / []
I have been wondering for a while between Andrew (who by the way is NOT a prince anymore) and Trump is the biggest lier ever. / ['Hes not HRH. He was born a prince and will die one. Its his birthright.']
"I don't remember ever going upstairs, so I can't have been in that photo, because I can tell it was taken upstairs, where I have never been." / []
Liar liar pants on fire! / []
The fact that he isn't being tried and executed is a black mark on the national honor of the English. / ['Off with his head!!!  Or at least to the Tower of London to give endless tours.']
She died knowing her son was a pedophile!!! / ['Look into the Jimmy Savile.  The queen covered that up too for Charles..', '@emmap1159 wow !!!', 'Now look into the Kamloops School missing children  after the Queens visit.  Ignore the b.s. fact checks.  It happened']
Her look of utter, frozen disbelief at 26:20 is hilarious. ( "I'm not one for public displays of affection.")  Pure gold. / []
Rapist / []
Shame on him / []
If you have never been upstairs, how can you know the picture was taken UPSTAIRS!? / []
Liar, Liar, pants on fire! / []
Pobre Andrew , primeramente , ella no era menor de edad , eso fue ‘ una conspiración , para destruirlos  a todos , el mundo esta en peligro , ya que masas de sociedades organizadas en crímenes , quieren acabar con gente importante, de miles de maneras , .. y la familia Real es una de las carnadas más favorita de estos complosistas , y que pretenden arrasar con  los demás , por que la Pricesa  Lady D , fue’ una víctima de esos terroristas que se han adueñado del mundo , y USA es el blanco más grande , y El Príncipe Andrés es una víctima igual que el Príncipe Charles  ,y la lista que esas mafias  tienen en sus manos, y Ucrania es parte de esa conspiración para acabar con el mundo , …Eso se ve claro que es un complot para destruir y manchar la integridad de la familia Real ..Hasta yo que no soy nadie , soy víctima de esa chuzma, / []
This guy is lying😂 so bad.. I dont remember?! That photo you cant prove it but i dont have no remember that.. If u didnt do that you wouldnt say it like that... He did😂😂 / []
17 í above the age of consent in the uk / ['She was sex trafficked, which means what he did is still not legal', 'She was a procurer as well picked up underage teenagers and brought them to epstein.....so she was as bad as andrew', 'Im not saying what happened to her wasnt painful or upsetting im saying that she found girls to bring back to epsteins crowd so she needs to give them an apology.', 'And virginia needs to give them part of that settlement money she may have been manipulated sexually but was it truly rape?']
Never heard so many ridiculous lies in my life / []
The most classic royal clusterf**k of all time. There will never be an interview like it because the other royals are too media savvy to allow it to happen. Emily Matis harnesses his hubris for maximum effect and he repeatedly shoots himself in the foot over and over again. A delightful schadenfreude engulfs me every time I watch this hot mess play out. / []
Is this satire? / []
Sweet lord - he has the mental agility of a moribund amoeba. / []
I don't sweat... lol / []
Be a Better Liar. Your family has to much money to be this bad at lying / []
this buffoon has led such a life of privilege and has never been held accountable for anything ... he can even rape a child and  literally be allowed get away with it by paying millions .. disgusting creep / []
Royal wrong un. Urgh urgh. Urgh. In the United States doing things . FFS. Pop it off. Charles / []
The highlight for me is when he pretends to think whether he could sweat or not at the time / []
Brilliant interview … this should be taught at journalist schools ! / []
*I wish this girl would force DNA and shut this mumbling idiot up!* / []
LIAR !!! / []
Prince Andrew...The Royal Rapist!  Congratulations, douchebag!! / []
The fact that the PR of the royal family will have spoken to him prior to this interview just shocks me. It really just shows you how out of touch with the public they really are. / ['..perhaps he had some coded messages to transmit?', "If memory serves me, he didn't take advice. Someone pointed out how askew his tie is. Advisors wouldn't have let him do that."]
What I find the most odd is that two people that knew too much about the royals both died in very odd circumstances that still don’t have obvious answers.  Diana  Epstein (a horrific character much like Andrew)   Odd / []
How did he get away with all of this after this interview. / []
11:20 Wow,, just wow / []
Yeah that brother lying lmaooo / []
What a disgrace of a fool / []
Someone should make an um um um video here, it must have been close to a 1000 ums / []
A powerful individual that thought no one would believe the victim / ['There was no victim, she was a prostitute who knew what she was doing and is now cashing in on it.']
I can categorically say that i dont think i can remember if i ever met this girl Oh right cheers andy buddy that clears that up / []
No doubt he screwed the young girl and the reason he stayed with a convicted sex offender is because he wanted more underage sex.  Prince Andrew was probably getting a BJ from an underage girl while talking to Epstein informing him he can't see him anymore.. / []
I hope this woman finds out what it’s like to be lied about one day / []
I hope Gilain and her family rot in hell / []
Whos we / []
I love how he INSISTS that jeff was just a “plus one” friend, and then turns around and says “it wasn’t right to break up the friendship over the phone”. Which is Andy….??? / []
It's great to see vainglorious journalistic hubris, financial opportunism, pile-on witch-hunting via social media, elitist posturing, Royal incompetence, public lasciviousness, poor friendship choices, sex trafficking, a suicide, and randy billionaire ... can combine like Peaches does with Cream ... to unite us all in one great big spirited union of sharing a love for three things:  Vouyerism, hating the rich and great pizza at bargain prices in. Mine's a Triple Pepperoni 🍕 with extra ham.   It's not exactly Frost v Nixon is it?  ..More uppity sixth former Emily, versus dodgy Arthur Daily, Andrew...  Great fun. They should make it a series, with a different stitch-up each week . Perhaps call it 'The wagging finger' or 'Dare to bare'.  Xx / []
This guy.... 🤦‍♀️ / []
Such a nice man / []
Worst display of lack of sympathy I’ve ever seen in an interview. / []
He didn't do anything wrong / []
I keep watching this interview hungry, before bed, at breakfast, when I’m drunk, when I’m stoned … it’s all just mad / []
The 'I cant sweat' comment had me howling wtf?! Hahaha / []
13:43 John Brockman, really? 10 seconds later... I dont know Brockman. / []
you generaly pay out millions  when you are Innocent   lol / []
full of crap  and lies / []
I suffer from poor judgement myself so I've jotted down a couple of notes.   If you're Patron of a child protection charity, book a nearby hotel if a convicted sex offender invites you to stay at his house.   Yep. I think I can work with that. / []
I mean thank you.  Hope you feel better / []
Thank for speaking about it, Andrew / []
Couldn’t lie straight in bed ode Andrew 🙄😂 / []
His body language is quite  telling / []
You love xxx with underage females . Just be honest about it Andrew. / []
The red room brown night club... U was there / []
I want to thank my family and the press who stand by the story i gave them / []
bbc kindly please do another interview with prince andrew of york i watch the video from beginning until finish i also take break from watching it. / []
হেব্বি খচ্চর শালা! / []
😂😂😂😂 / []
Andy got played by Epstein hard! / []
It was a convenient place to have sex with 7 to 14 year old girls pfttt pathetic royal family or not you are still a piece of s______t / []
no thank you julia robert is scary i don't want to see you / []
Stupid liar / []
The photo is fake....and Lady Diana died in an accident, and of course epstein commitedt suicide, case closed..right? / []
what a bad liar. and this represents......what?, He can come to the US now,,,,,,,,see what happens! / []
"Prince" Andrew was swimming in the deprivation created by his mate Epstien and loving every minute. / []
KO / []
The most evasive answers  I've ever seen. I have no recollection of that. Give me a break / []
St st st stuttering.  Nervous, Prince? / []
Hilarious / []
I spoke too soon. He is now squirming in his chair looking down to the left and is obviously lying. Again I find this to be the biggest act of a complete lying moron I have ever seen. The rest of the royal family must be horrified at his mere existence. / []
This is unbelievable I mean that sarcastically. How stupid is he to give this interview and say the things he is saying? He is a sex offender and a moron protected by the royal family. He is a royal and that is the only reason he is not in jail. / []
this kind of people you can not trust   in thousends years / []
i saw him i hate him   he is a bad guy  no more no less   even he has a lot a lot a lot of money / []
to long   too sad   to bad   and to boring   he is a bad guy  no more no less   bad people are around the world  he is just one more  and he is a big liar / []
☺ both of you are beautiful and handsome / []
I can't believe he is not in jail... / []
Andrew conspired with others to have Epstein murdered in prison. Once Epstein was arrested, his fait was sealed. He WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT had compromising information on Andrew. He, and all other vested interests, could not risk Epstein spilling the beans, so they arranged his murder.   I know this is speculation but I'd be surprised if it wasn't true. / []
This interview is such a carcrash 😅😅 #didntsweatthen / []
Andrew You are biggest lying peace of shit! And You will Pay for That Soon ! / []
2:09 Yea he brought a lot of different people together all right  All with the same goal  To use & victimize little children / []
⛰️🚞💥Train wreck interview🤷🏼‍♀️ / []
CRINGE factor 1 million. / []
/hundreds of people associated with epstein, even heroes of yours, so why just slate andrew? / []
An “honorable” man wouldn’t have had anything to do with a convicted seggs offender, let alone go to “dinner” with one. / []
I cannot imagine how his victims felt seeing him call himself “too honorable.” / []
He insists no one who gave him a “massage” was trafficked, but how would he know??? An innocent person would question it and feel guilty for not knowing or helping. / ['This is what I was thinking. He could have escaped a lot of flak if he admitted to having sex with this Virginia lady, and say that he is horrified to learn the full extent of the allegations against Epstein, and had no idea if she was being instructed to sleep with him, Like bloody hell, I came up with this answer in two seconds. This guy has had years to sit on it.']
Liar! / []
Prince Andy Shut a girl up giving her 12 million quid / ['um the us justice system is very corrupt thats why he did it']
You would think that he would have done a practice Q&A with his team before doing this. I think it’s pretty clear that they didn’t bother. Countless inappropriate answers. / []
😂 so funny, had to watch again .. was even better second time over / []
21:35-22:20 is the best moment. / ['Best', 'Moment', 'Ever', 'How the hell does this comment have only 2 likes?\n\nShould be around 20,000z']
Thank god Charles is the eldest otherwise we could have had him on the throne! *Cringes* 😐 / ["Look into Jimmy Savile, Charles's special friend.", "@emmap1159 So what...??? And for the record Savile have been long gone! Besides there are many friends of Charles and having had one like Savile sure isn't a reflection on the new King's character! So your logic is utterly ridiculous! 😏", "@jettser17UKThat's exactly what the firm hoped people would say.  Jim was a procurer for them.  MI6 knew exactly what was going on and yet the Queen knighted him and gave him the keys to those mental hospitals complete with a private apartment. Then Andrew with Epstein.  It's people like you, dazzled by their pomp and posing, that allows them to get away with it."]
Who ever told him this was a good idea. Emily was brilliant !!!   I cannot stop laughing at his replies.   He didn’t fool anyone. He knows nuffing apparently. / ['His arrogance let him self do this he was advised by someone on his staff who later resigned cause she told him not to do this interview']
If this was anyone else, and not a prince, he would be hanged 🤷 / ['In an islamic country maybe!']
"Unbecoming?  He was a sex offender."   The disgust on the face and in the tone of the brilliant Emily Maitlis spoke for the whole watching world. / []
Uncle Jim taught him everything he knows. / ['Jim will fix it.']
6:38 he knew his time had come / []
This is a textbook psychopath. You can tell none of this has moved him in any way shape or form. These girls he quite evidently abused are not actual human beings to him but just pleasure objects. The way he’s pathetically denying the authenticity of the photo of him is mind boggling. / ['Psychopaths are far more gifted at lying.', 'I wouldn’t go as far to see he’s a psychopath. That’s the most extreme version of narcissism and sadism but he is incredibly arrogant, entitled, dismissive and that has stunted his empathy somewhat but he’s not a sociopath/psychopath. Just an arrogant and pig-headed individual.', 'Is it too late to get a refund on that textbook, by any chance?', "Proves nothing. He was just nervous. Wouldn't you be? Innocent till proven guilty!"]
What is this pathetic man talking about, convenient to stay at sex offend house? Your mum was the queen of Great Britain, Prince Andrew has unlimited money to stay anywhere but no he chose to stay at a sex offenders / ['It was obvious it wasn\'t going well when the first question was "How did you meet" and he talks for almost a minute and a half about he wasn\'t a very close friend and he had an extraordinary ability to connect people.  \n\nMost  people would awnser that question  by trying to distance themselves from the person but immediately he\'s trying to justify his friendship.']
Burn in hell mate / []
And yet we saw him at his brother's coronation dressed in royal clothing... as if nothing happened. Scum. / ["He wasn't on the balcony and flypast thankfully!"]
Andrew should be stripped of any titles he has been given he has disgraced the royal family / []
32 minutes onwards…wow / []
Lying through his teeth / []
‘it was a convenient place to stay’  BRUH.... 😳You could stay basically anywhere... and you’re telling me that was convenient and the place you chose... / []
Selective memory on purpose / []
🤦 - Watching this after the kings corination. / []
How the tax payer is still paying for this filth / []
And this is were your hard earned money  goes keeping this absolute shower of gangsters in luxury it's sickening its time to get rid of them and make them work on digging ditches / []
"I dont remember" vs " I didnt do it".. professional interrogators know the difference / []
"I didn't sweat at that time"😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
I just felt so shy and embarrassed watching it😂😂😂he lost it from the very beginning / []
"Tendency of being too honoroable". Bro wut. / []
Andrew is a pedophile and King Charles will have nothing to do with him or is involvement with Epstein. You are banished from the realm Andrew go somewhere else and rethink your life you sick pedophile. King Charles will not have you tarnishing the good name of the Royals. / ['Randy Andy was at King Charlie Coronation lol']
10:19 freudian slip parapraxis, in other words subconsciously admitting to what he's been accused of. / []
Does anyone know exactly what it is that the British Royal Family does.? / []
This man was stepping into high level meetings with foreign dignitaries, negotiating big stuff and he can’t stop digging this grave ….Wow, astonishing! / ['He was given this job because of his position in life']
End the monarchy, it's time. / []
Sick monster / []
There is nothing wrong and bad with this at all / []
Andrew is innocent until proven guilty / ['Sure thing. When something walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, swims like a duck... its usually a duck\n\nAlso a duck that pays out over 12mil but was innocent. 😂', 'Why would he pay off someone with £12 million to avoid court if he was innocent. ?']
26:56 how does he know the photo was taken upstairs, if he never went upstairs? / []
He is so entitled. Horrible man . Complete embarrassment to the crown. Glad Charles is sorting him out and taking it all away / ['Look into Jimmy Savile.']
Lieing through his ole crooked teeth !!!😮 / []
The monarchy needs to be held responsible if he even steps foot near the coronation of the new guy. / []
Just gives himself away every single time.......Thank Andrew....Just thank you..... / ['thanks you welcome']
His brother Charles ain't any better   WEF / []
She said lies about André because someone else whants tô destroy his faith tô.God.I believe in what Duke of York is saying in this intervew. Who knows that he hás someone from his family that does not like him take care.Ask God for your protection. God May be with you / []

I am ex HM forces and  saw him several times, even when he was being interviewed on a Falkland street in a pristine flying suit whist we all looked like worzel gummage dragged through a hedge backwards..He  was an arse then ….. he’s a lying arse …. What a saddo / []

This guy… 🤦🏼‍♂️, just stop talking mate. Slag / ['Lmfao']
16:38 you can see how uncomfortable he is / []
Your judgement was colored by a life without consequences for personal decisions. / []
he went from: "i dont remember her" "no recollection whatsoever" to it couldn't have happened because the "date that's being suggested" is wrong bc he absolutely remembers that on a precise date twenty years earlier he was at a Pizza Express in Woking. LMFAO. Its a good thing he isnt testifying in a criminal trial. He'd have been in prison now for several years. / []
A PRADATOR PIDOPHILE! PTEWWWW...not even Christ pardon his dubious person! / []
28:01  I have just watched an interview with Prince William about mental health, then I watched this interview. All I have to say is please get rid of this waste of space , Prince William  will be an amazing King. / []
He sweating for sure now / []
Guilt is written ALL OVER his face.  The stuttering though…. Wow / []
The fact that people in the UK get more upset about Harry and Meghan stepping down from working roles in the Royal Family than Andrew’s self-serving, horrific attitude and behavior is beyond me.  He shouldn’t be allowed to benefit at all from the Royal Family property or money. / ['Well, on a grossness scale Andrew is an 8. H&M maybe a 7.', 'Distraction.']
He looked SO GUILTY at the Russian foot massage question! / []
um um um um um a sign of being thick. / []
Guilt written all over him / []
Doesn’t matter now / []
Did he just wing it? He seems to have done absolutely no prep for this. Does he not have a media team? So bizarre / []
GUILTY body language, answers ect kick him out of the royals lingering narcissistic loaf / []
4:37 “epstein is dead” “Yes 😂 “ 😂 😳 / []
10:21.. the proof!! U welkome 😂 😊 / []
"he was in and out all over the place" I wonder if Prince Andrew knew what he was saying lol / []
He may never get prosecuted but the public humiliaiton of the hollow shell of a pathetic coward is at least something. His vile to everyone in his presence. What a vile vile human. / []
Apparently once this interview was over the Prince was chuffed with himself - says a lot about his delusional nature / []
😂 / []
He is a simply dreadful man, entitled and obnoxious. / []
Only ten mins into this facade it’s obvious he’s lying. All of it. / []
I remember  Prince Andrew , when  I was in high school, back in 1985 and I thought he was so handsome and wished I was his princess.   .. now no way, no how. . 😅 / []

Prince Andrew has done done nothing that is predecessors haven't done before him / []
"I'm too honourable" / []
If time goes by and people start feeling sorry for Prince Andrew and want to let him back into the fold and carry out royal duties. Re watch this interview as it shows a man who has literally been caught out and literally throws everyone else under the bus to save himself. Who the hell stays with a convicted pedophile because its a convenient place to stay. Wow millions in the bank tons of hotels who would have rolled out a red carpet to have him stay over all the other contacts who would have given Andrew bed and board. Disgusting man / []
Epstein was taken out because a whole lot of bricks were about to fall. And fall on the heads of many powerful people. / ['The veil is slowly being lifted']
These people are sick and are not held accountable for any of their actions. No wonder they continually do unethical things and speak freely because no one holds them accountable or let them pay. / []
"strange and unpleasant activities have been going on" really? that's how you describe, rape, sex trafficking, abuse, grooming, coercion, ruining young girls' lives with trauma they will never forget? even if he was not a part of the "activities" himself, he certainly does not seem to have the moral compass one would expect any kind of decent person to have / []
This is brutal / []
He doesn't know what he doesn't know, and consequently, he is devoid of self-awareness. Thus he presents to most people listening to this conversation as a pathological liar, something he hasn't figured out how to handle and/or be accountable for in the scheme of things. He's not very intelligent... / []

He should return the shovels because  he's just keeps digging  his grave deeper and deeper  😂😂😂 / []
He is contradicting himself over and over again. He did everything he was accused of but its because of who he is why he got away with being an abuser. Shame on him 😢 / []
He's just a slimeball.  Funny he labels himself as " HONORABLE".  DIsgustingly laughable. / []
Emily: "...you could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on." Andrew obfuscated his response, not knowing how to extricate himself from the soft and pungent he has brought upon himself. He / []
Body language, voice timbre, convoluted answers and the gibbering guffaw he blurts out 44:42 indicate his lack of veracity. He strikes me as a borderline imbecile. / []
This man acts like being friends with Epstein's right-hand woman, the same woman who is also accused of the same sex charges like Epstein himself.  Makes him look less incriminating....pathetic. / []
Someone who doesn’t like him, encouraged him to do this interview 😆 / ['😂😂😂']
fk me this is a trainwreck / []
He is the best of human  kind let's ring the bells😂  we are fuckt get ur helmet 😢 / []
Not to make light of a disgusting topic, but I've shown this to my friends enough times that it's useful to timestamp the more ridiculous train wreck bits.  2:20 "I never have really partied." 4:50 birthday party? "No it was a straightforward shooting weekend (???)" 8:30 Was it the right thing to do? I had to go there in person to tell him 'naughty, naughty' and that I couldn't be seem with him, in person, since he got caught. 12:00 Staying with a convicted sex offender because it was a convenient place to stay. Hindsight 20/20, just a mistake because Prince Andrew is "too honorable." 18:22 Roberts discusses allegations of being sex trafficked to Prince Andrew. Literally impossible, Andrew doesn't know where the bar is in Trampt (?). He also doesn't drink. He also knows by date that he was at home with the kids.  20:23 He went to Pizza Express, super memorable, weirdly distinctly. "Oh yes I remember that." 21:20 "She was very specific about that night. She describes dancing with you and you profusely sweating." Andrew has a medical condition from being shot at because he had an overdose of adrenaline that makes sweating literally impossible. He's since recovered from this condition. 23:30 Photographs of photographs of photographs - no recollection of the photograph with Virginia Roberts. 30:58 For a man, sex is a positive act so he would totally remember having sex with Virginia Roberts but he doesn't. 33:59 "You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on."  47:57 "Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." Andrew also cannot bear the idea of not using Epstein's American connections because Epstein was effectively American royalty. / []
It was a shooting weekend, I forgot that bit. / []
Staged, orchestrated, practiced to no end, let’s admit he’s a pedophile, watch his eyes and body language it’s lies, he said he was in the navy they came to port, lies upon lies he knew about it all the royal family has investigators that investigate in matters to keep the the royals out of the spotlight, he lies cause he was told to avoid certain occasions, orchestrated, staged , coached / []
I wonder, if Epstein was the only one who provided him underaged girls. I can’t imagine that this phaedophile, sex offender did nothing else. Makes me so angry. / []
He just adds words to confuse u / []

He reminds me of Pieter Overmeire the peaodphile from Gelraton West Australia using his power. / []
He can certainly still remember every business relationship agreed upon at dinner, after all he has forgotten everything else and without the influence of alcohol a lot of things would have got stuck. A book title for this prince: "How efficiently business relationships come about at dinner". By the way, why didn't anyone look for his fingerprints on the "upper" floor, there must be thousands of them there... / []
Since the prostitution of numerous children has been clearly proven, there is really only one question. How can it be that with the number of people who have visited the islands over the years, no one wants to have noticed anything about child abuse? According to Andrews, week-long binges were only held on the island to entertain business contacts. With Prince Andrew's fat face, I could almost believe he was just stuffing himself there, although his face could be so swollen from lying. / []
His guilt is seething!! / []
I still can't believe he did this lol WHAT an idiot. / []
Paul Page says Andrew is not very bright.....really?? Lol / []
Destroyed the image off the royal family this bacon / []

The arrogance of the man, with his brazen dissembling takes my breath away. I met him through his girlfriend (Maxwell) like she was an acquittance rather than one of his best friends. / []
The only client on Epstein's client list to come forward and admit he stayed on the island many times and in others of Epstein's houses. / []
When I go out in London I wear a suite and tie, so it can't be proved that it's a real photo 😂 he is such a tool. He withers my colon hahahah / []
He thought he could just snigger an tell his bs lies and walk off. I love this interview for so many reasons, this scumbag should have got jail absolute disgusting how he didn't get jailed / []
I don't know him so I don't know what he's talking about. Everytime I watch this I come across more lies from this scumbag / []
Just watched this,feeling bored,always knew he was a snidey person,his body language and facial expressions,give it away. / []
What a cringe fest of an interview from Randy Andy! he will never come clean about this as the lie has gone on for far too long and to say that he wanted to tell Epstein in person that he could not be friends with him anymore is an absolute joke, anyone else would have just severed ties, he's just trying to explain away why he met up with him there in the park, the public is not that guillable to believe him, Surley!!! / []
Deny everything.What a liar! / []

It infuriates me how the media focuses on Harry and Meghan but stay completely silent about Prince Andrews. His poor victims deserve justice but with how the media is behaving it seems like they’ll never receive it. Absolutely shameful! / ['But he said he never had anything to do with it.', '@LoveMusic-nq7pi He was pictured with Epstein multiple times and was caught leaving his apartment waving goodbye to a young female. He’s guilty.', 'he is scum...', 'He’s now had everything striped, Henry and the wife have not. They’re  next. Don’t piss the Reigning monarch off.

He served bravely as a pilot he has always had a eye for the ladies he was born a prince born priveliged and Rich protected he dropped a clanger with Epstein and it backfired big time but at the end of the day who among us hasn’t dropped a clanger got it wrong did he know the girl was trafficked.Ultimately it’s irrelevant it’s finished him as a public figure but it shows one slip at the top it’s a big fall. / []

Which golf course begs the question in  Epstein's  mind what was in Epstein's mind and (why) is that a very good resounding question?... He certainly must have been courting him as a customer.... Unless there was somehow a gay side to this discussion.... Hum..... considering a private polygraph test to see if it can be passed.... But of course it can... then another one public polygraph exam... To sweep all this nonsense under the rug in the name of the family... And why does one tilt their head to the side like that I wonder... Giving off such an energy and facial expression  for us innately to suspect or realize something?... Jimmy did you take the cookies from the cookie jar????? / []
I couldn't of done this interview, props to her for keeping calm and keeping her poser! Just watching him and listening to crap that is coming out of his mouth gives me chills so I couldn't imagine being in the same room as this sorry excuse for a human being.

He lied and said he cut all contact then trips inselve up about the visit in 2010, been a part of the Royal family you should have known better. Why would you want to face such a sick man. No excuse. / []
Well this man's got his own problems but what I would like to know how come nobody has ever said anything about the fact that Bill Clinton visited that island over 65 times now he didn't go there To play golf or swim in a pool.. So he needs to be indicted and explain why he was there that many times and there must be some girls come forward and testify as to the fact what he was doing there as if we didn't No.. That would have been Donald Trump they would have already investigated this is swiftly as a possibly could.... / ["eriwn monti\nIs you one of them there illiterate moonshine swillin' yank rednecks, girl?"]

It was so ridiculous, I couldn`t understand why he said that. But you are right: He is a narcissist and he was offended. He couldn`t bear the idea of him "sweating profusely", so he made up a medical condition.

He’s blatantly lying about something. He’d be better off coming clean. It just sounds terrible. / ["And he's not a very convincing liar either. He'd be better off had he just stayed silent, but it really doesnt matter. Unfortunately, it's likely nothing will come of this anway."]
There was no reason for him to stay connected with Epstein when he saw how young these girls were. He’s a huge lier.. He like that kind of thing for a very long time. / []
Good gracious, this man is a buffoon, full stop. Not to mention a liar. So gross....blech. I'm going to scrub myself in the shower until I feel clean. That's going to take a while. / []
Watching this for the fifth time. I love it so much! / ['what do you think of the references to pizza and adrenaline?']
So a call girl wants more money, and exploits Me Too to get it. Horrible world. So what if the dear prince had sex with a young prostitute? - He was much younger 20 years ago. No harm done. Why doesn't he just say "Oh, yeah, true, there was a young prostitute, very expensive, and she came to me a couple of times". / ['Because she was below the legal age.', "@controllerbrain So she earned a lot of money, knowing she was below the age, and now she wants more? Poor prince. She looks old enough on the photography, old enough to say NO to the prince. But she said YES because he was royal, and she wanted the money. And now she milks him even more. She is the culprit, not the prince, and you know it. The prince was stupid to say yes to her, he should've known better.", "Maybe because she was underage?????? Hellllloooooo.... that's illegal here in the good ole US of A!!!!!", '@DawnSmith-hg5kx It was HER who offered her services to thhe prince - I guess Epstein said to her "Go make the prince happy" or the like. She then started massaging the prince, and gave him blowjobs and such. Yeah, stupid prince should\'ve said "Hey stop, how old are you?" The girl on the famous pic looks old enough to say to Epstein "I\'m not going to do sex stuff with the prince" - but she did it happily and proudly, and now, after 20 years, she suddenly heard of "MeToo" - and she thought: "Wow, NOW I\'m going to famous  and celebrated and rich. This is very prestigeful, wow. It turned into a prestige project to her, and the money that comes along. What a brat. \n\nIf I were the prince, I would tell the truth, and have my solicitor make her look like a cheap gold digger in court.']

A room full of party goers, orgies, threesomes oh………and Andrew. Imagine all those years that went by & not one word was said! That’s where those that hold highly regarded titles cannot risk their reputations being soiled in any way shape or form. Are we honestly to be believe that certain persons within the royal family weren’t made aware of a situation that could cause irreparable damage to the monarchy.   Let’s face it…………any human being that had “allegedly” raped a minor, would almost certainly fear themselves being exposed within the community they live in either by the victim, eye witness’s or by word of mouth. Would Andrew have taken that of shaming the Monarchy. Of course not!! Therefore I truly believe the royal family protected Andrew all them years ago by using their wealth in return for peoples/victims silence.  It’s an absolute insult paying a woman off that’s made an allegation of rape against you & not only that he should of been charged with the crime, investigated then tried in a court of law.    The king then disciplined his brother in the most punishable way possible. Removing his title & banning him from Buckingham Palace.   That should do it Charlie!!!   I know I’ve rattled on a bit but I was so passionate about this family keeping up our British heritage, Andrew basically revealed the real him in this interview, fiddling around if he were a little boy playing with an elastic band in his hands. Fibbing his way through the interview. I wonder how he feels now knowing the famous photograph has been proven to be real.   The queen will go down in history not only for her time spent in service but for the downfall that followed sadly. / []
Andrew’s association with Epstein ensured that he will will never emerge with his reprehensible reputation in tact. Since then Andrew hasn’t  aged well. Additionally, he gave a convoluted interview. / []

Who dressed this man ? He was probably sacked when "dodgy Andrew" viewed it... His tie is all over the place.. 👔 Deary Me !!! / []
Such an honourable explanation by prince Andrew, yes yes🤣🤣🤣 believable indeed. Someone else said it was just a dinner for charity and he is dead now;  and one another mentioned that he visited  island just for shoulder massage. Such an innocent bunch of humanitarians with wealth. / []
"I wasn't good friends with him.... I only saw him 2, maybe three times a year....  I was friends with Ghislaine, not Epstein....   I felt I had to do the honorable thing and tell him in person that I couldn't be seen with him any more. I owed him that...."  If they weren't good friends, why would Andrew feel obligated to go and speak face to face to  a convicted sex offender and tell him that he couldn't be seen with him anymore?  Oh, and Andrew, if you're not going to be seen with someone, don't go for a walk in a public park in the middle of New York city in the middle of the afternoon.... / []
Bu bu but Meghan, b but Harry 😂😂 / ['I know the public and right wing media always having ago at Harry and meghan but never Andrew', '@James_Doyle83 British media can’t go after Andrew. They have been threatened with lawsuits from Andrew himself.  In fact they can’t even show that picture of him they discussed here. British laws are not the same as we have in America.']

Seems like he’s gay 4 him / []
I do hope Andrew Mountbatten does write a tell all book and he exposes all those “elites” that have been sexually abusing children and women.

This deviate can make all the excuses but the world sees this cowardly PERVERT for who and what he is,a member of an international sex ring exploiting,abusing,humiliatating,trafficking children.No excuses Prince Andrew take responsibility and ask for forgiveness.Prince Andrew 'S lies are palpable ,he doesn't drink?  Then why is he in nightclubs he is so disgusting bringing his children 'S names and activities going to Pizza Express with his underage daughters,is so slimy.Bringing his war experience is not a pass for his PERVERSIONS.Prince Andrew is a disgraceful excuse for a human being.Prince Andrew and his part in an international sex ring focused on trafficking young girls for purposes of sexual activity,orgies,ritualistic sex activities.Prince Andrew is a godless,soulless,out of touch,deformed,out of touch MONSTER.Prince Andrew is forever a PARIAH his ex wife is a money grubbing,lowlife,the extended members of his family Royal or not have proven to be craven,destructive,exploitative and evil.The British Monarchy is over it is a facade made up of entitled,nasty,deviants that don't respect other human beings.It is all about their own filthy appetites and aberrant desires.They are DEVILS,DEMONS and should be shunned by humanity! / []

Why doesn’t he just speak the truth?  He’s been caught.  Pedophiles are among the extremely well known and wealthy too.  He’s already been stripped of his royal title and navy status.  Coward.  Just be honest!  He is just like Jeff.  Denial, denial and more denial.  Thank goodness Epstein is gone.  He was trash.  Nobody believes you, Andrew!  A worker at one of Epstein’s estates, said he saw Andrew with that same girl in a pool, and he was rubbing against her.  It’s all on Netflix. / []
He never once describes Epstein's behaviour as naughty!  "He has an extraordinary gift to bring extraordinary people together"...you know, like royalty, bigwigs & teen hookers?...."well, you must understand that I asked myself these very questions...and it was the ONE time I was proven to be at his house party, that I was JUST ABOUT TO TELL HIM we shouldn't be friends anymore!"  What a coincidence!  "But I think  that's a rather stark way of putting it....I wouldn't say I went to his dinner party...I mean, I WAS there, and there WAS a dinner, but...!" / []
No you're making shit up  Andrew / []
Almost  impossible for me to sweat  , so his lies and hers feck doctors who say it b 🐂 shit / []
He has the cheek to  mention the N SPCC / []
Thick as Sh t / []
Its not the royal family's fault that they have a disgusting family member as long as they don't cover it up ..I would respect the royal family more if they let him get locked up for good in a real prison / []
Check out what his driver and security team think about old Randy Andy it's on youtube they said he is uber arrogant aggressive and rude and completely condescending to everyone around him / []

He reminds me of Alan Partidge 😂 / []

Abolish the monarchy. / []
I wonder how many loves he has ruined / []
Thank God we ain't in medieval times / []
Thank you very much indeed ! Wtf says that / []
He admitted to staying on his island for God's sake 6:30 / []
Imagine all the dirt they have on him / []

I would of hit him with the “YOU KNOW YOU DINE FUCKED RIGHT, YOU D  OK NE FUCKED UP” movie Menace to society 😂 / []
The first two minutes was enough for me them damn blinks and head shaking would of put me on the floor with laughter😂😂😂😂 I couldn’t have interviewed this man. / []
odd / []

I come here for a laugh every now and again 😂 / []
What a creep / ['I love my own thing .']
Mad how our government funded propaganda has actually decided to ask some important questions / []
What a A1 class moran!!! Cannot believe this guys crap! / []
Oh what a sickeningly greased degen / []
I went to see him with the purpose of telling him it would not be appropriate for us to see each other.  I thought it was the right thing to do sometimes I am too honorable .. Lord jasus this lad is a clown 🤡 / []
I wish Andy had employed me as his advisor before this interview. My fee is astronomical but I could have saved him a lot of grief. Lie enough to get you off the hook, about things that can’t be disproved. Tell the interviewer that you met Virginia, went dancing with her but you two never had sex. Drop all the stuff about never meeting her, never having been upstairs in Maxwell’s home, not sweating and being at Pizza Express. It makes you look ridiculous. If he took my advice he would have gotten a home run. Look me up next time you are in trouble. / []
How is this man still in the royal household / []
If someone is falsely accusing me of committing a crime, you bet your ass I will call them a liar. Why sugarcoat it? / []
A straight forward shooting weekend LOL 😆 / []
"Who ate all the chocolate Andrew?" "Well, looking back at it now, and having the benefit of hindsight. I couldn't have possibly eaten the chocolate, because of my medical condition at the time of that incident, when as far as I was aware I was literally a dog, and eating chocolate would've probably killed me". / ['Underrated comment', 'Emily: "can you elaborate on that comment?" Andrew: "I\'m sorry, but I have absolutely no recollection of what I just said"', 'This is not a funny situation but this comment is hilarious', 'I am also far too honorable to consume the chocolate', 'Would have been a better lie 😂']
Spitting Image probably won't have to parody any of his dialogue. The real thing is way more hilarious. / []
They probably had the AC set to 2° Celsius so he wouldn't sweat. / []
Epstein died in a prison cell where the cameras were off and the guards sleeping. This was obviously staged to silence what he knows about western leaders and people just rolled over like the sheeple they are then people ask the government why they have crappy jobs, high inflation and their lives are miserable and getting worse. Soon, you will all have your 'rights' taken away and will all be chipped and sent to concentration camps to be eliminated. / []
Disgusting man who required maids to ensure that all his cuddly toys were arranged in the right place according to a laminated photograph. Why do we have a royal family?! We are bootlickers to these morons. / []
My man was blinking like he was on ,,how to catch a predator,, with Chris Hansen / []
His children know he is a scumbag. Job done. / []
Arrogance is staggering / []
Arise people are you going to take this shift / []
And he's still alive / []

王子はどうして投獄されないのでしょうか　 少女の人生を台無しにして、どう償うつもりなのか / []
Who doubts Trump was involved in there somewhere. / []
just like dim Harry, he contradicts himself every few minutes - example:    [0:56] "I met him (Epstein) through his girlfriend (Ghislaine Maxwell) back in 1999 and I'd known her since she was at university in the UK and it would be to some extent to stretch to say that that I think where we were close friends where we were friends because of other people"  Then he goes on to say he kept interacting with Epstein becasue of Ghislaine.. he went to Palm Beach Florida house, to see his friend Ghislaine, the invitation to Sandringham for a small shooting weekend was to Ghislaine and JE was her "Plus-1", he invited Ghislaine to Windsor Castle for Beatrice's 18th birthday party and she brought JE as her date.  No wonder I waited 3 years to watch this.. that moron is guilty as heck, and his entitlement and his communication style gave me a migraine! / []
It was the wrong decision to befriend a rapist and human trafficker. You didn't realize that becausd YOU ARE THE SAME AS HE WAS....A NASTINESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!You are disgusting! Interviewer probably had to decompress after this! Her level of self control is flat out AMAZING! / []
Stink dirty Liar! / []
Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie Lie ...Lie...yuh hear lie..dat is lie...teacher Murphy say if you tell ah lie you going to hell as soon as yuh dieeeeeeeeee! Man does lie...man does lie...man does lieeeeeeeeeeee. OMG / []
I thought he was nicknamed the Duke of Pork because of his waistline not because of all the porkies he told. / []
Emily staying so calm let Ponce Andrew open up and keep BS’ing his way through this train wreck. / []
This is up there with the Nixon, Diana and Monica Lewinsky interviews / []
Unbelievable his PR team let him even do this. Clearly they are all Effin fired now ! / []
I think I must have something wrong with me because I believe the Prince in this interview totally. He is not very good at defending himself but then, Royals rarely have to and it in no way means that he is lying, quite the opposite in fact. He gets so much terribly bad press these days and it just seems to get worse, poor chap, I wouldn't want to be Royal  for all the riches in the world these days. / []
Then why the out of court settlement. Ask him. Closer to guilt than. / []
As Prince Andrew did he had an out of court settlement beyond court and legal judgment so he is guilty against the monarchy and the monarchy should except the legal requirement of the act of law application. Words are hard to apply logically so. So surely if a out of court agreement is applied that is not absolute law of uk law of a functioning citizen of uk law requirements. King Charles should correct law correctly. Or who justice lord secretary. / []
Hahahahaha, 'I was head of the N.S.P.C.C.' ?  Wow! set a thief to catch a thief, lol. / []
As soon as Ghislaine Maxwell's 'little black book' is discovered she is safe in prison. Once that leverage is gone, she's history. / []
Literally the whole interview I'm picturing a little boy explaining away why he was caught res handed in the cookie jar....it might as well be animated. His body language, demeanor, speech, tone, everything is just like; IM LYING. / []
This is the dumbest interview anyone has ever given / []
The guy is an idiot hands down morron / []
" my tendency to be to honorable" / []
What a piece of trash!! This prick lies as though he believes that everyone will believe his lies!! The Royal Family must have fallen to the floor when they watched this!! / []
love his poker face every 10 seconds 🤣 / []
This interview makes me want to 🤮 / []
The nightclub not have cctv? / []
I can’t help but think of our late Queen, and how she must have felt. / ['she was definitely in on it wdym she’s just as gross as him', 'Pissed that she had to pay out all her luverly taxpayer-gotten gains to the victim, probs.', 'She paid out the money for the settlement, instead of making him face the music. So, she was complicit.']
Gifted interviewer. / []
At 31minutes and 32 seconds into the video the answer he gives to the question he's asked is just ridiculous - what the hell is he on about? / []
Am I the only one 2 years later still watching this video and thinking from the first moment I saw that crooked tie 'this man is a duck' trying to look calm on the surface while paddling like furious chaotic hell underneath. / ["What a great mental image you've created."]
Boo hoo babe / []
I love these spoof type interviews / ['Not a spoof', '@AmusedKayak-fx1lu Never ha ha']
body language experts dinner / []
If anyone from now on asks how honest I am, I can gladly say, I lie like Prince Andrew....... / []
Wtf ? Have you got Any brain or did you loose it at the Falklands ! You are guilty as hell ....you are just like all other Monarchs . They all had many " wemon " just admit you like young Girls. This interview will go down in history as the worst for you Andrew ! And to do a 12 million Pound deal with one of the young Girls you have taken advange of makes you guilty as f... / []
this interview is able to be so funny because there is no understanding or acknowledgment of the gravity of this heinous crime. All he has to say is:   i was shocked and horrified that a person i considered a close friend did such evil acts. I thought I had such fun experiences with this man and now everything seems suspect. I so wish I would have suspected something was off and helped those victims. I think about those women everyday and will do what I can to make sure this crime never happens again.  obviously that is a lie too - but at least it seemed a more human response. / []
Positive action…wtf? / []
Watching again. It’s disgusting. Imagine living in a country where some people still hold a dysfunctional family on a pedestal. A mother who shielded him and paid $$$ to keep a victim quiet. Sarah Ferguson not mentioned and she knew exactly what was going on. / ["I totally agree. It's also been discovered that Epstein loaned Sarah a lot of money to bail her out of one of her many money messes. She knew. They all knew. They must really think we're all idiots!", "Well, it's removed HIS pedestal!", '@intercommerce true!', "Andrew funds Sarah's life.", 'Oh yes, and I remember how they treated Sarah “Fergie” at the time and let her be portrayed in the media, then framing the divorce as her fault. She’s hinted about stuff like this over the years so yes I believe she knew and the royal family threw her under the bus to discredit her.']
He ended up on a 12 million settlement, my question is, who payed for this? The queen? / []
Has he done anything different than millions of men do paid for sex. Did he even know how old she was. Did she say I'm under age I doubt it. Its 16 in the UK 17 in America would he have known was he told maybe not. / []
Sweaty jackass. No sense of self awareness whatsoever. / []
Not one expression of concern for the victims / []
Public displays of affection are not something I do - lol, just got to google him all over women out and about on holiday haha / []
"it was inappropriate for us TO BE SEEN together" - not, I didn't want to be his friend anymore because he's a filthy sex preditor! / []

Me when I lie / []
All that energy and time I'd put to learn English has finally paid off :))))) man this is too good. / []
Watching this makes me feel he's lying a lot but not about what you might think. I think he slept with the girl but didn't know her age, he can't admit he slept with her as that will destroy the royal reputation so he had to lie about knowing her. However I don't think he knew what Epstein was fully up to, seems he just turned a blind eye and they roped him in as a scapegoat to shield from their real clients who we'd be shocked if we knew. The Queen probably didn't disown him because she believed he genuinely wasn't part of the racket, but he did do a lot of questionable things. He got those leg massages for sure. / ['You are a fool if you think that he didn’t know about the girls and their youth, they were likely the reasons it was «\xa0convenient\xa0» to stay at Epstein’s']
That's it wa.nckers / []
The royal family killed Epstein so he didn’t out this pedophile / []
prince andrew is such a bad liar i am astonished he did any interview or will ever do one again. what a loser. what a fool. / []
He thinks he "too honorable"...riiiiiiiight / []
I know this has been said many times but Emily nails this interview. An absolute masterclass from her. / ['she is a good women. the fat guy is a pervert', 'He deserves a prison sentence in México on death row ( basically see how long it takes him to get killed)', 'A train wreck for Andrew', 'A train wreck for Andrew', 'A train wreck for Andrew']
Gotta say fair play to him for thinking we are as thick as him / ["Or...you might have said that he doesn't know what he doesn't know...a trait that distinguishes him from those of us who do..."]
This is like schadenfreude ASMR, I come here regularly now just to relax... 😊 / ['LOL i kr ']

What a series of utterly bizarre answers and replies. It's insane that this exists. / []
I DON'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY TELL ABOUT PRINCE ANDREW, IS ALL A TRAP, AND THAT FOTO IS FAKE / []
The Royal Pedo Prince and his extremely cringe-worthy gaslighting. He is an embarrassment to humanity and the King Douchebag of the UK. / []
What a loser! / []
Wat arrogance,all about him blah blah,and general public have a go.at Harry more so. megan,but yet this creep.hides away,.I find that strange / []
He is despicable - arrogant person having sex with young women the same age as his own daughters and then he has the gall to bare face lie about it. He should never be allowed to show his face in public again with anything to do with the royal family. LIAR. You just put threw yourself under the bus- the worst LIAR ever. Revolting man. / []

It's awful that there are so many people who are able to lie so shamelessly and skillfully in front of the whole world about such awful deeds.  Real estate agents are bad enough but they're rookies compared to this guy. / ['Not sure about the skilfully part, as everyone can see through the 🐂💩', 'Definitely not skillfully 😂']
And this political activist, not a journalist (because journalism pursue & report the information as it should be), not to put poo on people to try to sway the system as this woman is doing it, trying to put poo on the royals. Anybody told this silly political activists fetid Leftist woman, that men don’t menstruate, they have needs, & clever women aware of those needs is why they go prostitution, regardless if they are married or have a profession & this guy, single in his youth, tonnes of woman would have wanted to banging him free not charging him any cent? Also tonnes of women knowing that rich nice looking males were having parties in Epstein house & get paid for sex, which is called prostitution, which was legalised in England in 1161 they would have fought to go there & have a go to the personalities. I cannot believe it how this hypocrites fetid leftist woman (who arrogantly is mistreating the person like she is a grumpy mummy), is virtue signalling around the world, like we the leftists “we are the right people & the royals are the perverts ones only”. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
This report it’s absolutely sick, racist, grossly discriminating & patronising. This is just high moral grounds whinging, by the most corrupted party in the world, the CMs Democrats LGBT, Jews warmongers, who started in 1950 the disintegration & infiltration of the western Christian world by a German Marxist Jew, H Marcuse, due to with the useless Marxists economic system the proletariat, enjoying the toys & features of capitalism, they wouldn’t go to fight in the streets against the conservatives. With the infiltration at all levels, especially schools & Hollywood, they made all wrong right & vice versa, so bestiality, prostitution, homos, drugs was all okay. It’s not the problem of Epstein who paid prostitutes aged 17, who lied with their age, called minors, which is ridiculous, Netflix it’s paying 11 years old girls for twerking  & bunging the floor? The virtue signalling of this report is so corrupted, that shows only Epstein, Trump & a prince, they don’t show Clinton & other corrupted Democrats, who flew all the time in the Lolita express? And the other thing, we had this CMs Democrats LGBTQ Jews perverts, that one of its paramilitary secret services FBI & the DOJ, have classified & is persecuting as terrorists, all those parents who complaint that their little kids has been taught homosexuality at school, not the school curriculum. And this suckers whinge & cry foul because a guy full of testosterone & money, hired prostitutes, in circumstances that porn in Hollywood movies is legal? Incredible. The girlfriend of this guy should never had been jailed, especially convicted in a New York court which is fetid with CMs Democrats LGBTQ, full of perverted Jews & the suckers don’t jail real criminals, especially blacks, due to Social Justice rubbish, system that protects & glorified LGBTQIA’s & is converting all little kids in homos, in the most discriminative action ever & allowing Male trans to get into girls & women showers, & a big scandal because a guy pay a prostitute? Are this people mental sick? Cannot believe it. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
I love how Emily Maitlis made this fool squirm. / []

Sick as a sick could be,mfsob. / []
Take him to jail he can has a big party there / []
His "tendency to be too honorable" WTF ? / []
“If you are a man , sex is a positive action” and hence be remembered. Hmm. For women it is not positive? / []
He had the most extraordinary ability to bring 7 to 14 year olds together. / ["Yes, he was a mover and a shaker, Mister Epstein. There's never a good moment to talk about him. That's what I always say. Then I talk about him in a taped interview for a hour.", 'Not sure what mumbo jumbo he is making up to justify what he is suppose to do in life at the end of the interview ….bringing young people together : aye right 😬']
1. “Public displays of affection is not what I do” . Ah.. it’s NOT public, stupid!!! 2. “That photograph was taken upstairs and I had never been there..”. How did he know it was a photograph of upstairs if he had never been there? Right? / []
In his own words ‘ A bit of a stretch’. How to destroy your reputation and credibility for the rest of your life in one easy lesson!  Why he did not agree the Q’s before hand and had them checked by all the Royal aides?  Dumb and Dumber. Andrew, like most Royals are so deluded and arrogant that they think what they say is good enough. Photo shopped photo.. notice the red eye and reflection  in window of the camera flash. / []

LIAR! / []
Hes such a dick, poor old fergie got all the blame , but she was so strong now thats wat u call bullying can u imagine if megan markle had all this hate just like Sarah fergie she wouldn't survive / []
Randy Andy has no sympathy or empathy for anyone but himself. Poor guy has never partied or felt the need to. Bless him and his twenty odd teddy bears. And the woman who took money in court to wrap it all up should feel ashamed. Instead of preventing others becomming victims, she took a payoff. Tragic state of affairs. Another royal escaping justice. What a surprise. I had to laugh when he states the house was like a railway station. He must mean there was a lot of human TRAFFIC. / []
The Royal Prick is so screwed over this. Only option for him now is the Met Police force. After all they employe murders and rapists / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender", her reaction was my reaction wtf 😅 / []

How much did they offer you to delete the footage and not air this train wreck?? 😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
Is it true that when her Majesty died, the Corgis were given to Andrew because he is good at grooming? 😂 / []
It’s unlikely that he’s not lying. / []
Sounds like they barely knew each other.. / []
What was with his reaction at 13:41 lol / ["He probably didn't expect Brockman to speak to Newsnight for some strange reason"]
Hahahaha / []
13:40 is a nice highlight. / []
Did he go to a party hosted by Jimmy Saville ? / []

Can this lady please interview Harry and Meghan??  She's so good! / ['What about?']
This looks like he is about to explode like R.kelly / []
The fact that he doesn't remember doesn't mean he didn't do it. He probably assaulted so many girls that it wasn't new for him, and he forgot. / []
Digusting entailed man, he should be behind bars. Notice how everytime he shakes his head he's lying. / []
Happiness is a warm gun..bang bang shoot shoot.🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
This interview will age well as wine / []
It's when he says he didn't sweat at that time isn't that him saying he didn't sweat when he was dancing with her / []
This idiot wants to challenge the settlement.  He forgets that we’ve all seen this sadly hilarious train wreck.  “It was his (Epstein’s) girlfriend” that was the attraction.  Yeah, the convicted sex trafficer and rapist Ghislaine Maxwell. / []
All white men are ped0s / []
This case goes back to prophecy we have been enslaved and human trafficked they are attempting to kill the king / []

We will see when it's claimed in English law there is two sides to every story / []
This is cringe making to watch. / ['Shup']
I support Prince Andrew. I've been in that situation. Sometimes, you just stay where it's convenient. I used to stay at Harvey Weinstein's mansion all the time. I mean, sure, I could hear all these people crying for help in the next bedroom, but I just thought it was the TV being too loud. You would hear, "Sir, please call the police", but I just thought it was a movie on the TV. Who would have ever guessed a reputable man like Winestein would do something like that. I'm a member of the British royal family, so I have to stay somewhere nice. I once stayed at Mar-a-Lago, but decided never to go back there because there where all these paper's all over the place marked "CLASSIFIED". You literally had to crawl around all that paper all over the floor. / ['Spoken like a true paedophile 😡', 'you are a liar and a blowhard']

Are all of u swallowing this bull shit something is seriously wrong with this picture / []
Liar. / []
Looking back. The Prince and others may have been tricked.  Best outcome for any innocent ones who could have been played by Epstein & his accomplices. / []
The things he lies about is the oddest thing. If you had a partying past, own it. Apologize for it if need be, but don't deny it if there are photos proving it. Idiot. Edit: Ok, but the way this man is wording things makes me think that he and Epstein were having an affair. He went with him for a walk in the park to "break up their friendship". Maybe its just me, but that just seems oddly personal. Especially when, "he was just a friend of some friends." / []
Why would a person that was going to to tell a "friend" they didn't think it was a good idea to be seen together again or be associated with the said "friend" go to a public park to tell them they shouldn't been seen in public together. Very very logical. / []
BS so much 🙄  BS... / []
Anyone else notice how “Your Royal Highness” was cut from the very start of the video? / []
Andrew, being the Spare to Charles.... Seems as reckless and resentful as Harry. / ['No, he has not been the "spare" for decades. That\'s why we have a new Prince of Wales. Got that, have we?']
Unbelievable. Is that guy so stupid or did Dame Edna put on her double chin and speak??? / []
The pedo prince / []
So SO glad this piece of 💩 has been exposed like this. Good job maggot. / []
There’s nothing’Honourable’ about being him / []
You can't polish a turd. / []
The picture of Prince Andrew and her is a fake. / ['I just googled it, there are still conflicting reports about it']
Wow I’ve never seen someone dig a bigger hole for themselves. Clearly never been held accountable for a single thing a day in his life. He has the lying skills of a 13 year old boy lol. He settled out of court because he knew he couldn’t win 😂 / []
He can’t even fix his tie.  You see the lies spewing out of his creepy mouth!! 🤮🤮🤮He should be water boarded  or given a lie detector test.  He is evidently a horrid person. Documented by all!!! / []
Came here after the shambles of a story on the front page of the Telegraph today trying to discredit the claims of Virginia Roberts. The accuser he never met yet gave £12M to silence her. They done this by sticking two adults in a bath, one with a Prince Andrew mask on and one with a mask of his accuser. His PR team’s ludicrous attempt at rehabilitating his image has only reminded the British public of this car crash of an interview where his mendacity is apparent for all the world to see. / []
The problem with throwing mud is that it sticks sticks sticks sticks, guilty or innocent.  There could never be any other outcome on such a sensitive, ugly and dreadful subject, trafficking of minors.  There was never going to be anything that he could have said. / ["He could have said he was sorry and he was setting up a charity to help abused women. I think that's what was expected."]
Wow no wonder Harry and Meghan left the Royal family, racist sex traffickers / []
13:43 his face right here was legit. He was shocked that Brockman said that. He is such a piss poor liar. / ['That face screams "FUUUCCKKK!!!"', "\u200b@mechengr1731His body language moves SLIGHTLY but it gives the game away because it's the only time that happens"]
It’s hysterical how the royal family lives under such a strict set of rules and protocol.. yet, they allow Prince Andrew to dig his own grave on national television 😂 / ['😂😂😂', '..they made him do this before kicking him out, he may have been sending coded messages to the rest of the ring']
Sick chronic liar / []
Talking about education???????? / []
He is such a bad liar and the royal family used taxpayers money to pay off a victim to keep her quiet is a disgrace if he was not a royal he would be in jail it makes my blood boil. The royal family or not above the law they should be go to prison if they do something wrong like this it’s disgusting. If this was 200 years ago he would have been be headed same with Megan and Harry. How can they protect someone who hurts kids it’s all disgusting / []
Not 9nce i heard him say to have any remorse for the victim...they guy is guilty  philphy little pedophile / ['Oh please! Those girls knew what they were getting themselves into.']
guys i think i believe him.. he said he was TOO honorable.. Hard to argue with that / []
Hi pedofile u should be in jail !!!u should be newer aloud to pay of your crimes with tax payers money!!! How stupid is uk people letting him get a way with! U should drag him down ! Make protests against the evil monarch ! He use young girls also in America! Together with his pedofile friends Clinton,bill gates and Emstein!!! / []
He has terrible lawyers to allow him to do this or at least not sign a contract on editing or if it can air depending on things / []
He makes my skin crawl! All that expensive education has gone for nothing, because he’s also thick as two short planks! / []
Disgusting behaviour / []
He was better off saying he didn't believe the allegations against Jeffery at the time, just as his allegations where fabricated but now can't believe what was happening. Damn that was hos only defence and shouldn't have done this video / []
He is saying oh it was his wife who i was really friends with as if no one would figure out she was in on it to. / []
Why is someone born into royalty extraordinary? They are just born into royalty that did nothing to deserve it… just saying. / []
What I would describe as !!!! a load of Bullish  Andrew, Big Shovel comes to mind / []
We still HERE We ain’t forget ! / []
This guy is disgusting.  Why was he allowed to keep his title till Prince Harry got in trouble? / []
Royal Idiot / []
*If I were him I'd never show my face in public again after this interview!!! It's PAINFUL & PITIFUL!* / ['He wants to come back - \n10 out of 10  for tenacity', 'Do not judge the book by the cover even if it comes with holier than thou cover']
The key question should be why isn't he in prison yet?  The answer is: because  Mommy didn't let it happen.  A privileged criminal. / []
I think  Prince Andrew was honest in this interview. Its unfair and unjust for to interview a Prince in this manner. He was a very very handsome man if he wanted a woman  I think he most certainly would not have chosen a prostitute.  Prince Andrew should now take this back to court .Get back the millions he paid during the late Queen's  illness . Not allowing this to ruin his life. / []
Great interviewer.  Very prepared and he made a complete ass of himself and proved to the world that he was a "player" on the Epstein plane and compound.  Here's a nice 15 year old for you buddy - enjoy her. / []
The, the, the, ass hole…shame!!! / []
Pizazz was a code for that prick and he even used it in the interview for using the young / []
Pizza… / []
If you watch the body language guy..its proven now the photo is a fake as photo experts have found multiple anomalies...it is totally clear this mani s innocent...even though hundreds of other rich and famous people attended epsteins house Prince ANDREW WAS TARGETTED BY A GOLD DIGGER WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ACCUSED OTHERS BEFORE HIM OF THE SAME ACCUSATION...DO THE RESEARCH AS THE TRUTH IS IN PLAIN SIGHT / []
Eppstein didn’t kill himself, but Andrew sure did commit suicide on national tv…  He could’ve just said ,,Millions of people take pictures with me, anyone can point to a random photo and make up a backstory for clout“ and be done and over with…or you go with a…fAkE hAnD story. / []
Break up a friendship 😂more like breaking up with his boyfriend!!! He had already told him once so why the second time? He was so committed to the “friendship” why was the visits so far between?  The walk in the park was to plan their story/lie!!! I’m sure he had NO idea that the media was not close to sickos house with all the publicity that was going home! This dude is beyond stupid!!! Again we weren’t that close but it took 2 x of breaking up the friendship!!  He just said he didn’t know where the bar was then said just the opposite!!! / []
for the first time since Ghislaine and others pointed the 'fake' foto, once you see it you cant unsee it, and watching the interview again, totally different perspective.....i wished he pushed back more rather than using the 'i dont recall' line which clearly comes from lawyers.... / []
Bahut Badi Choot - BBC / []
"Well you see now, there's a problem with the Tramp story....I've never been to London"  Interviewer: "You were born in Buckingham Palace, which is literally in London, England"  "Well now you see,  my people have looked into it and they have categorically concluded that i may have been born in London but that does NOT mean I have been to London...but I don't recall being born at all, so how could I have been to Tramp nightclub?" / []

Dirty little Nazi pedo Prince , hiding in his palace so he can't be prosecuted in N.Y / []
Sex abuse young women is criminal / []
I still find it unbelievable that this person subjected himself to this. I also find it amazing that he thought it a success immediately it ended. The sheer arrogance of these kept people. / ["It is a success. What makes you think it's not?"]
U go and meet in person so no one can listen in on ur conversation. / []
Interviewing a paedophile on the BBC, SHAME ON YOU. lock him up / []
In the late 1980s in NZ, our whole school class walked a kilometre or so into town to line up for hours to watch Prince Andrew and Fergie drive past. After watching this I regret it. I'd love to believe him, I like the Royal family, but I just can't. He's lying, it's in his eyes - lying about more than just that one girl too I'd wager. / []
When you say "there are a number of things wrong with that story" surely you mean to present objective facts that would hold up in court NOT "I don't know where the bar is" or "I don't sweat".......We need something better than that crap Andy. / []
He is now trying to overturn his settlement he made to Giuffre. What is going on in his head. Says he wants back into public duties. Whatever the truth is most people don’t actually want this guy back into public duties, this fact just doesn’t seem to compute in this guys head / []
Prince Andrew has always been an arrogant, rude jerk.  I'm so glad that KARMA finally got him!  He's and embarrassment and a disgrace to the royal family and all of the U.K.! / []
He embarked on this as a P.R. platform to set the record straight with an attitude of lofty heights - far above any unpleasant, tacky accusations - his Royal aura & status will be recognized  w/o any need to explain for "people like me."  The interviewer let him take the long rope, stammer & bumble on then threw out dates, witnesses, facts to the contrary w/o being abrasive or combative, but left him struggling in his web of deception. His head bobbing yes when he was " categorically " spewing  "no"... or " I can't remember ".  What a disaster for Andrew: a masterclass in interviewing!  ( 3 rd time watching, it's brilliant!) / []
Six million reasons why I'M NOT guilty. I'M A ROYAL, I'm a Royal, I'm a Royal , I'm a Royal etc etc etc,etc / []
That weirdo creep is a liar and disgusting 🤢 🤮 / []
He denies everything in this interview / []
I have watched this interview like 20x🤭 / ['😂😂😂😂', 'what do you think of the references to pizza and adrenaline? Both significant in the world of people trafficking']
I see his accuser backed out of allegations against another guy ..  bit odd that.......🤔 Is this woman actually credible? How many of you here commenting have ex friends/friends etc who have committed crimes..... Did you know about it?  This has been a utter stitch up . / ['You are a total Prick to have this opinion! Are you on Andy Pandys payroll???']
Andrew probably let him Epstein fiddle with Beatrice as return payment for Virginia. / []
this interview is full of spinning, while his credibility sinks. / []
Father in Jesus Name remove the privilege from those who have hurt the citizens of the world in Jesus Name.  Lord vengeance is Yours, Lord Jesus reveal all the wrong doers and let them be jailed for their crimes with the appropriate sentences in Jesus Name........ / []
After seeing police video of the insides of most of Epstein‘s properties, I find it hard to believe that Andrew did not “ have a clue“….. Full blown sexually explicit photos and paintings of nude and semi nude young women everywhere! Some of them quite vulgar. He is such a liar. / []
Deny everything Baldrick / []
Absolutely disgusting. Entitled POS who thinks his title and position affords him to behave grotesquely. No body fooled here.  Sickening charade. / []
Hands up those who believe MI5 in conjunction with CIA or and FBI fixed Epstien's 'suicide' all in an attempt to cover the asses of this piece of style and others just like him. We all know damned well that the customers of this circle were well documented byt Epstien, yet it's all disappeared! / []
Entitled Pedophile With A Title´......F-U That shitshow,send him to jail... / []
What a pathetic loser. / []
Big thanks to the BBC for not turning off the comments / []
As an American who just watched this for the 1st time,I've never seen a man so thoroughly destroy himself during an interview. It enrages me that he still managed to get away with it even AFTER this interview. As an american,  I truly feel sorry for the British people who have to pay taxes for THIS guy to go through life with no consequences. / ['@Stefon I reckon I meant REAL punishment. Like the kind he would get in prison.Sent up the road.', "Amen 🙏 Buck Fo Jiden 🚳🚳 C'mon man", '\u200b@Stefon He still lives in a different world from the rest of us. His old pals will back him due to his position everything back to normal', "it amazes me how child r%#ping thieves are honored in the UK. I don't know how any moral person can be proud to have that as their history.", "Andrew may have  been very naive and stupid, he's been lured into an embarrassing situation involving prostitution.\nProstitution is illegal in America but there has not been court action to prosecute the prostitute involved .The prostitute was of consenting age at the time.Why the fuss?"]
What a liar ! And a disgrace to the Monarchy! / []
Very interested I am 5 minutes in, and he’s being very dishonest!!! 😮 / []
This man can’t lie to save his life 😂😂😂😂 / []
Problems at the gates. / []
how much more will the UK pay to protect this pedophile? / ['he is a disgusting abuser but i dont think he is a pedophile. pedophiles dont have interest in pubescent girls or boys. pedophiles lose interest when their victims get in puberty.']
Guys he’s really the hero in all this . He’s such an honorable man that he had to go party with a child molester to tell him they couldn’t be seen together anymore lol / []
I don’t care if he did this or not they should have him drawn and quartered anyways god what a prick! / ["Exactly mate the fact he isn't and the public allows him to be able to pay off Virginia with their own tax money means they deserve to be too", 'The peon masses allow this sadistic game to continue.']
Disgusting how he not in prison dirty sad man / ['He paid £12m']
pathetic, this guy is so pathetic. / ['Is he lying?']
🤣🤣😂🤣 GO ANDY! GO ANDY! / []
I react the same way when I’m lying to my gf / []
As someone who reads body language... This is laughable. No wonder why they keep him locked away from media now. This moron lies like a 12 year old / ['Is he actually lying']
Wait…..does he still get to rape children? What about the orgies with 14 year old girls? What about drinking the blood of babies? It’s still a “small penis” it wasn’t hurting anyone! This isn’t fair.  At least he still has Hell to look forward to. His parents are eagerly waiting for him down there. / []
If he wasn’t close to him why even bother to “end” the so-called “not close friendship”.. / ["He did explain that. He's an honourable man", '@jakehyams8659 imagine you are “not” close to someone and they got charged with a crime such as Jeffrey. I would just keep my distance.. lawl', '@jakehyams8659it’s like telling an acquaintance you can’t be acquaintances anymore..']
😡 / []
This remains the standard that Harry, Meghan & all the rest of them will aspire to / []
I bet he wishes he never agreed to this interview.🤐 / []
Regarding the sweating, there’s an old saying in The Deep South that applies perfectly and it is: “I don’t think I’d atold that.” 😂 / []
"My judgment was probably,...... Coloured by my,...... Uhm......... Tendency to be too honourable!",.... / []
IN THIS INTERVIEW ANDREW BASICALLY SAID  “IM A PEODO GET ME OUTA HERE” / []
PEODO ALERT / []
2 years later and I still cannot believe this thing thought stating It only cut ties with a CONVICTED sex offender was because their ties were made public. If the media hadn't shown this connection It would've continued It's friendship with the sex offender. Calling Andrew anything other than It's legal name would be an insult to that term. Can't call It trash as that would be an insult to trash. / []
A bag of pop corn appeared in my hands while watching / []
Jimmy saville and Jeffery Epstein both close friends of the royals ...  Mm .. somewhat questionable eh.. / []
Nonse / []
Arrogant like the rest of them get rid of them all in foodbank uk / []
I can't sweat = get out of jail free card / ['Lmao literally. What an idiot']
I've stayed on his island, in his home, used his money and planes but I wouldn't say we were good friends / []
So you mean to say that one of the most secured and important locations in all of Europe (Windsor Castle) doesn't vet it's visitors? / []
The fact that he can get away with this is so sad. / ['Get away with what?', 'pizza and adrenaline', 'Get away with what']
This is one of those videos that you can rewatch time and time again. / ["Yes, it's hypnotically entertaining, innit.", 'Not really he walks free', '@jackybogues2495 he was never lockup, so how can he walk free?']
So what are we, the collective going to do about it? Or shall we just giggle in the comment section as this man walks free? / []
The Royal family is people living on welfare with no intention to get a job. Y'all not mad because they are white...smh the irony / ["You're an Open Racist."]
I’m afraid to say that there’s a medical condition that says I didn’t do it 22:15 / []
12 million pounds later and we're still having our taxes spent on this "Man". Disgusting. Abolish the monarchy. / []
What a lying " royal " PIG  . 🐖 [ 🤣] / []
Can we get the death trifecta of deviouts? Epstein  Pell ......? / []
why he make this interview? he lies for everything. he doesnt remember this , doesnt remember that. trush person / []
You already know he was remembering the horrors he did on that girl , man deserves jail / []
When you feel down  and demotivated with your mediocre life, this reminds you that from time to time life will give you something to live for 😊this interview is this to me / ['Amen', 'A shame he hasn’t been convicted though', 'Scumbags like this get to live a life of luxury whilst the rest of us hard working decent people get shit on our whole lives', '😂 good therapy']
1.54 “ He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together”. What do you mean by “extraordinary” you jumped up, Fecking Cant. I’d love to be in a room with him for 5 minutes, no holds barred. / []
Mummy, I have just finished the interview. It all went splendidly well. You don't need to worry about a thing. I have put the entire horrid nonsense to bed once and for all. / []
Positive action???😂😂😂 And when he said he'd never been upstairs (after being pictured up there with the young girl) because the lounge was downstairs. he was defo telling on himself😂😂😂😂😂 / []
The British Royal family protected a pedophile. i'm no David Icke fan but he might have a point when he claims they are reptiles. / ['Not reptiles lol they’re satanic']
The Most Gullible Person On This Earth Could See He's A Blatant Liar!. / []
I love how he keeps deflecting by saying "I was just friends with his girlfriend...He was merely the +1".....and now Ghislaine is convicted and proven to be accomplice to Epstein. So none of those answers hold up now. / ['Yep!']
13:42 "Another guest is John Brockman" Andrew's reaction said it all. He almost died. He knew he saw him getting that massage. / ['I agree! I think it speaks volumes his reaction when Emily says ‘Another guest was the author John Brockman’. The way he reacts suggests that he was thinking ‘really - John Brockman’ - like he knew exactly who John Brockman was. But then a couple of seconds later, he says ‘well I don’t know who John Brockman is, so I don’t know what he’s talking about’ - completely contradicting the look he gave when Emily said John Brockman’s name!', "13:47 his hands move SLIGHTLY but it's a massive tell", "13:51 through to 13:58 he says he doesn't know him but nods no meaning he does know him", 'It seemed to me he was indeed shocked', "Prince Andrew's eyebrows and face dropped faster than a facelift, Definitely knew Johnny boy! 😂😂"]
Wait-he is a Prince and he can’t get a hotel room when he goes to NYC on Royal business?  😂 / []
He on a video sat at a pool side on the documentary with a young girl how can he lie about it and worse still get away with it / []
If you don't remember you must have been high or you just full of bull shit / []
He should be in jail 100% lies all way through it he should be banged up like anyone else / []
Yup yup yup there we go / []
Weasel / []
Anyone else here watching this interview to take the load off harry and his book 😂 / []
Can we as a world promise to never forget what he did? Its been a while now and I am concerned that we have forgotten what he did. / ['Yes man', 'People forget what was done. People forget what was said. People NEVER forget how it made them feel. 🤢🤮🤬', 'lets hope he never have sex with any more children. he should be on to catcha predator', 'By relieving him of working royal duties, Queen Elizabeth insured we won’t forget Prince Andrew’s poor decisions. Can you imagine paying all those millions to bail your son out? While she didn’t show it, QE musta been steamed!', "I never watched the interview in the first place but started digging this morning after seeing a bit about it in a YT short.\n\nI'm sure it will have a nice surge in viewership again. Just too much happening in the world to absorb all of it."]
i don't remember, I dont remember, I dont remember, of course you dont remember. / []
Well, you do not have spine...... / []
Terrible liar. / []
You are, what l would describe as, a liar, at the end of the day. / []
I'm sure  we've  all  had friendships with   people  during  our lives,  who have only ended up diappointing   us ... invariably we learn and move on.  I think  Prince Andrew was foolish to  discuss this  with  anyone but his advisors legal, et al. Of course the Court. I am not going sit in judgement.  Also, I'm  turning  it  off  now. If he answers to  the  Court lets hear the judgement.  It must have been  very distressing  for our late Monarch ... who has since departed this life. That is my primary  concern.  Now you're  behaving like a dog with a bone. I'm  waiting for all legal outcomes not trial by Media. / []
His mother coddled him from the day he was born and demanded everyone around him do the same. He was never held accountable nor suffered consequences for any bad behavior. He learned to lie, manipulate, and con, and demand from the time he could talk. He was taught to believe that he really was a prince  among men, that ordinary people are less than human deserving no respect. That he grew up to associate with evil people and commit the crimes he did comes as no surprise. One has to feel some sympathy for him as he was basically groomed to become who he is. Sadly his parents lived to reap what they sowed. Even after all he did his mother still couldn’t bring herself to sanction him as she should have. It has taken Charles to have to complete that job. For Charles having to deal with his brother and now go through what he is having to with his son, I don’t see how he has his sanity. He has aged so much since becoming king. What a shame. / []
Dirty old men.. / []
What an ugly ugly individual / []
Prince Andrew: "It was me, im the guy dont even glance at the Royal Family. They werent involved in any way. It was me im the guilty looking one who did nothing and it had nothing to do with the FAM......can i go now"? / []
So epstein provided underage children for god knows what to the royal family and Prince Andrew is the fall guy? Am i seeing this right? / []
I don't sweat🤣 / []
Give a royal enough rope… / []
Would you be willing to take a lye detector test ? / []
He doesn't sweat... / []
Pizza Express is so good that it wipes your whole memory for a decade and it's the only thing you can clearly picture in your mind / []
the photo was taken upstairs but i've never been upstairs - then how do you know that photo is upstairs if you've never been there / []
The english royal family is a disgrace. First Charles marries his mistress. Then Andrew is charged as a seksual pedofile. Then Harry rewiels embassing things about his family. / []
His crime according to some is being found out / []
Ah randy andy got caught and stripped of his royal duties, sucked in cant... / []
Ohh its definitely a picture of me,...but i cant explain how it exists / []
Between Harry and Andrew, wow.  Can either of them possibly be any more imbecilic?  One is a foolish buffoon who thinks his shit doesn't stink, and that he can get away with anything.  The other keeps on digging himself into a deeper hole together with his wife, with no possible way of "winning" in the end. / []
Is this man crazy? / []
For a guy that holds the " highest standards" he sure studders a lot / []
Imagine the level of delusion required to actually think this interview had gone well. / []
He shudda started from the off by saying , years ago whilst playing polo in the back garden , Charles hit me on the helmet with a mistimed swing , and since that day , , blar blar blar. Yes total crap but better than the shit he waffled / []
Royals/ rich people live by different rules, even a blind person could see his guilt / []
He was staying with the Consul General down the street. / []
Sniper? Anyone? Please? / []
Let’s get aggressive folks. Otherwise these snakes will continue to exist / []
And this pedophile is free and clear folks. Cause no one did crap to push harder to put this demon behind bars for life. Wake up folks / []
for a start he suggested he couldn’t have been upstairs because he didn’t know what it looked like but then said he couldn’t have been upstairs and had the photo taken because it looked nothing like upstairs 😳 / []
As always people in power canc get away with anything even though we can all see its all a pack of lies / []
Never met her but pays her millions to stay quiet 🤫 / []
Qween must  have been pleased she was an old lady and not have to witness anymore of her family's embarrassing comments I know it's not nice to say but she must have . / []

Oh the royal burden of being too honourable... / []
Gislaine the last alibi standing 😂 wonder how long will take for this high profile pedophiles to wack misses Maxwell and fabricate some BS like Epstein suicide 🤔 / []
What a terrible liar. The fact this nonse isn't in prison is a disgrace / []
Prince Andrew is relying on plausible deniability.  Except it doesn’t seem plausible, that’s why this totally bombed for him. / []
This was literally one of the best interviews with a public figure that the BBC has ever produced to date. Emily Maitis' professionalism and deliverance paired with Andrew's delusion and fumbling is amazing. / ["It's comfortably the best. Utterly legendary", 'Absolutely!', '😂😂😂😂', '😂😂😂😂', 'Andrew is probably guilty of poor judgement and being a bit of a cradle - snatcher, but that’s about it. 17 is not below the age of consent, and there are 17 year olds (and younger) pushing prams around all over the U.K. and the US and nobody is chasing after the fathers.']
He seems to be stupid. / []
I'am sorry, but for me people who don't drink are always suspicous. / []
Jeffrey Epstein definitely had dirt on him and others. That’s how he got all his money in the first place. These were NOT his friends. It was all business for him and Ghislaine Maxwell. / []
Liar liar pants on fire 😂😂😂Prince Andrew😮 / []
@18:50 is my favorite part of this interview: Prince Andrew has NEVER been held accountable for his actions in life. So what happens when you’re not held accountable? You lack empathy. You also become a terrible liar. He’s God awful at lying. When someone asks you “have you slept with a teenager” you’re supposed to say “NO! I would never do such a thing. That is disgusting. How dare you ask me that deplorable question!” This guy said “I have no recollection.” Meaning it did happen. He did not deny it happening. He specifically said he didn’t remember. He’s a terrible person and a terrible liar. We ALL see right through his bullsh*t. 😒 / ['genetic propensity towards narcissism +, growing up in a lack of control environment can make a narcissist. \nHG Tudor knows about these things', "19:18 says it didn't happen \nLooks at his body language \nNods to say no", '19:22 proves this \nWhich I genuinely laughed at', '22:20 to 22:30 same thing', 'Actually 22:36']

Jeremy "rottweiler" Paxman would have torn him apart 🥊 / []
His “tendency to be too honorable”, what a laugh / []
Liar. / []
It would be so refreshing if he just said, Jeffrey enabled me to get access to young women.  I slept with Virginia when she was underage and I should to be punished for this rather than this cringe fest. / []
How dare he drag NSPCC into it. What a scumbag. / []
The lies begin almost immediately about his friendship with Epstein. / []
Watching through my fingers! / []
Pedophile 🤮 / []
And the sick racists would rather talk about Harry and Megan Markle smh / []
Where are all the body language experts to pick this interview apart? They didn’t miss telling lies about Meghan and Harry. / []
It's  strange how he says epstein used to bring a strange collection off wealthy, intellectual,Intelligent,professional powerful (peodofile) people!!!!!....why has him and these people never Been investigated!!!!??????....But they lock up a man called Andrew tate??????????? / []
Disgusted, my grandparents and great grandparents worked hard to support this, I feel ill / []
Aaah yes, just a straight forward shooting weekend 🤣 / []
1 Corinthians 15:33 33 Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.” / []
He has every reason under the sun to justify why he was in contact and stayed with Epstein. I don’t believe anything he says. What a disgrace. / []
The structure is still there and exist. Fetishes and productization of humans is something we didn't agree on when we chose democracy. / []
An absolute nob, rude and obnoxious bully, he should be kicked out of the royal family / []
Cringeworthy / []
Cringeworthy / []
Epstein described Andrew as "a useful idiot" . Love to know about his naval career, opinions of crews. / []
Horrible vermin / []
damn liar / []
for someone who is supposed to speak english better than most he stutters so much. / []
Man, this guy is a totally pathetic liar. / []
Appalling that the British hate Meghan more than Prince Andrew. / []
Can't decide whether he's sweating like a Cucumber in a Nunnery or Gary Glitter in PC World 🤔 / []
Does he have a speech problem 🤔 / []
I wonder who he payed to assinate Epstein so he wouldn't snitch on Andrew in court / []
For me the most important part of this was his talking of his need to to tell Epstein that it was not appropriate for them to have further contact. Amazingly, he never says that he does not want to spend time with a convicted sex offender. Seems to me that he is in complete denial of own faults. / []
Oh we've all had a straightforward shooting weekend!  No further details required.  Keep yourself focused on that black women that's trying to destroy the RF! / []
"We were not that close, I just stayed in Epstein's house". / ['It was a convenient place to stay', '\u200b@Jake Hyams  yeah he tripped inside and tried catching himself on a little girl and accidentally pulled down a little kids pants']
This guy was so unprepared it’s ridiculous… it’s like he didn’t know the information was out there. / []
Very contrite and humble 😂😂😂 / []
He makes me feel sick / []
Why did the Queen strip him of his royal duties? I'm sure it's not because of the free accommodation at Epstein Island / []
Why isn't this on the front page every single day? / []
Why isn’t he in prison (aside from his status)…statute of limitations? / []
He's finding it soo hard to believe everything he says it's hilarious / []
Reminds me so much of the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire coughing major... / []
I fell asleep with YouTube playing in the background and it obviously did it’s thing and went from video to video until this interview started playing (even though I saw it when it first came out).   I woke up a half hour into the video, after having a weird dream about this creepy old guy who was trying to hurt some children, and I just knew that he was a pedophile, so I tried to get the children to a safe place and yelled at the guy to leave them alone while he droned on and on and tried to justify his behaviour. And then I woke up to the sound of Prince Andrew talking, droning on and on, and trying to justify his behaviour.   His creepy voice affected my dreams. / []
Skum! / []
He’s not that close to him!!! Sees him 3 times at most a year, the guy stayed in USA / []
He’s not the partying prince ie he doesn’t party. His chat of tramp night club says other wise / []
completely out of touch with anyone's reality but his own. He has no clue how he will be perceived by the world saying those things. I wish I could obtain that much privileged, and I hope that it would humble me to the point that I would never do anything as embarrassing as this interview, it's clear it bothers him that he is being accused; he called himself a "we"; Americans that do "go hunting", what is a "shooting weekend"? A party?  What? Now that the person he claims as his friend has been convicted, this looks even worst, and he admitted he was "using" Epstein", he might have been in the company of this girl and does not remember her, but his real problem is he lives in a different reality, and he thinks he can say anything to the normal people, and because he is the "Prince" they will buy it.  All I can say is I hope he did something, because it has cost him a lot. / []
Who's here after the musical? / []
This guy is full of shyte, why has he not been sent to jail. / []
This very immature, niece individual should be banished from every firm of charity, public life, remove any titles, and public money! / []
It is probably difficult for people in Britain to understand the  rise and wealth of certain people like Epstein. The financial world as we have now seen with Bitcoin is odd. In Britain I think that parentage, school and university as well as the newspaper you read would give one a good idea about people, their ideas and their lifestyle. Epstein had tiers of friends..There were carefully cossetted people whose social standing and wealth brought kudos to his enterprises and then there were others who perhaps were not so innocent or pleasant and were only too happy to enjoy the fruits of the seamier side of the Epstein business.  It was interesting that The Duke of York was offered the use of houses when in America. A famous American lawyer fell into the same trap. He stayed , at Epstein's invittion at one of his mansions. Later he was accused by the same person who accused The Duke of York. He decided to write a book about her allegations and document exactly why and how she was lying. His book is called " The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of MeToo" by Alan Dershowitz.  The young woman who accused both Alan Dershowitz and The Duke of York has now said in a public news conference that she was mistaken. A bit late, having detroyed The Duke of York and left a smear on Dershowitz. A disgrace.  Before anyone criticizes The Duke please check out the facts.  The case against  Maxwell will hopefully come to trial (she is in prison now) and then we might find out what, who and when all this took place. She will presumably want some sort of clemency and therefore will 'spill the beans' on what was real and what was simply defamatory make-believe for blackmail purposes or merely to disguise the real trafficking in young women.  It has to be said that President Trump rescued one of the young women who worked for him at Mar a Lago, from the Epstein trafficking or whatever it was that was happening at his neighbour's mansion. He said, cryptically that he had not spoken to Epstein for 15 years, that was presumably when he was told about the young woman  who worked for him and when he rightly intervened . / []
He sure stutters a lot.  He tries to look royal but he’s scared! / []
Andrew glitter stand up / []
Seems legit. / []
Man a ruff criminal who like dem teddy bears! Man bat em eyes continuously. Man got access to best a dem education an em sound like em fail every class! Brilliant! Cheers mates!! / []
It is not worth being a coward. God always forgives but you have to be honest with him. / []
what a car crash / []
This man is Not Of Normal Criminal Etiquette / []
this guy is pure scum. he needs to be prosecuted / []
Is he just that obtuse or a pawn? I really want to know when will Emily interview Meghan? / []
Finally decided to watch this. I find it hard to give the man a benefit of a doubt. / []
Comedy gold / []
A shooting weekend yeah I bet / []
He was friends simply because of their shared interests in under age girls. Scumbag. / []
Andrew is clearly as thick as shit. Who advised him to do this interview? Lol / []
Everybody knows how disgusting & obnoxious this prick is. Hopefully karma will kick up your ass one day... / []
He is a disgusting terrible liar … … he needs to be accountable for his action!!!!! You are a disgrace for everyone next to you!! / []
🤢 He has to face the music … no matter who he is… disgusting 🤮 / []
Disgusting  / []
How anyone can confuse a party with a straightforward shooting weekend is beyond belief. The sheer level of callow ignorance and unsophistication of the general public is breathtaking. / ['Hahahahah']
Give him a hiding and he'll sing in minutes. He clearly did it. / []
“I can’t sweat” / []
This interview is an amazing social observation of how someone can deflect the truth and also not take responsibilities, no doubt social engineers will be looking at this for years and showing how unconvincing his arguments were, quaking in his boots comes to mind, im still surprised to this day this interview happened, its just a pity that that hierarchy still cant be touched by the law, but deep down they do know what occurred, along with the dogs on the street. / []
I do not understand for the life of me why Meghan is soo hated! When you have this person. He is by far the worst human being in the royal family. / []
One can imagine thousands of royal years of lying about indiscretions...a person would get pretty good at it.  Andrew is an exception. / ['narcissists often believe their own confabulation']
"That photo was taken upstairs" "I never went upstairs" !!!!!!! so how did he know where the photo was taken then ???// / []
I’m off to pizza express tomorrow night. / []
Dear Prince Andrew, now you'll see who your real friends are! From Ms Diana LaFleur / []
Those photos were photoshopped that means put together via computer, you were framed Prince Andrew and that little lying witch pimped your mother out 10 million dollars and caused all this wrongful stripping you of your titles, patronages,and salary, as well as damage to your character and livelihood . Prince Andrew you need to assemble a legal dream team and sue! From Ms Diana LaFleur Oakland CA USA"Clear your name"! / ['P.S. I am the mother of Alexandria Sims, I am 63, Iam very concerned about Prince Andrew, keep your chin up! God is the ultimate judge, only God can judge you, not Charles, not me , just God! Keep your head up Prince Andrew!', '@Soda3000Pop weirdo']
Prince Andrew should have not given this interview, he should stayed silent and in the back ground! I'm an Prince Andrew supporter I believe he is innocent! / []
He reminds me of a Nounce. / []
We were not that close but I had to go see him to  explain why i need to dump him...Okurr / []
OMG what a Pratt!!! 😮😮😮😅 / []
Accused of being a sec offender—DUDE he ran a ring and supplied you with underage girls that were vulnerable and held with threats of physical harm, financial ruin and family violence / []
Funny that he had already been to jail for underage sex—RAPE when Andrew kept hanging out with him. / []
Infamous tantrum thrower says he isn’t competitive but cooperative. 🙄  How about collaborative, as in a collaborator with sex offenders and slavers , IS a sex offender, got the Lockerbie bomber off because of his Momar Gadaffi and other despot relationships.   This guy is attracted to evil becuase that is where the pleasure with no one daring to say NO is, that is where the illegal and quick money is, etc / []
I can’t give sensible answers because I can’t tell the truth and the lies sound funny—I wish they sounded better. / []
Doesn’t even see how he hurt his own mother / ["He just didn't care"]
This bugger needs to be in jail / []
He was supplying me with young girls—how did this happen, I just don’t know how he did it!!! / []
One of Andrew daughter s is dyslexia I am but did not know till li was 34iwent  through hell at school Prince Andrew daughter  was brave and did not  hide the fact that she was dyslexia  she came out and brought dyslexia out in the news and  helped miions of dyslexia suffers  hope fergie and Andrew should  be proud of theirs daughters they are excellent mam and dad / []
Pedooooofile / []
Prince Andrew was born the same year as me 1960 he is no angel he made mistake s  we all have  he does not  do royal duties now  but why does  king Charles leave him out of  family events Andrew two daughters are a credit to him he is a brothers of king Charles  the king should show compassion to his brother he supposed to be  head of the Coe so why does he not forgive his brother I fell out with my brother my mam would have wanted us to be friends  as  Jesus  said  to love  one another those without sin cast the first stone also to Harry and Megan they are family no Matt er what my family forgive me  so  learning by our mistake es is a start / ['Andrew is a Paedophile and involved in sex trafficking. No, he should not be involved in any family event or be in the public eye, so keep your ridiculous opinions to yourself!']
Andrew is LIAR....filthy Pedophile....you need offing !!! / []
As if some one photoshopped sweat patches on him not knowing this guy don’t sweat 😂😂 / []
He’s quite mad and dangerous to young women 🫢🏥👩‍⚕️ / []
Absolutely amazing peace of comedy 👏 👌 🙌 / []
That 7.5 million he "spent" decorating the cottage was money given back to him yo pay off Virginia guffrey. The British RF laundered that money otherwise they would have had to explain where it came from / []
I cannot watch this filth. It's sickening to know he got away / ['With what?']
I nailed it! / []
Who belonged to the "cosmopolitan group of US eminence" that were at these parties, mentioned at the top of the interview? Name names! / []
I saw one of the Palace security officers who said that Prince Andrew was Queen Elizabeth's favorite -- he also said that Andrew was the worst of the Royals - said he was a very nasty abusive man towards the help -- Andrew saying he had no idea what Jeffrey Epstein was up to is like when George Clooney says he had no idea about Harvey Weinstein -- / []
I watched this live when it aired and sat in shock, back here now for a laugh. / []
What a train wreck and he is a Royal?? Just what I would expect from a narcissist like this clown. / []
"Uh, Um, and, Uh"  You can always spot a liar. This man story is all over the place that proves him gulity / ["He always talks like that, stammering, Charles too, it's a upper Brit thing. It grinds on me but besides that, he is full of cr@p.", "Still not proof. A court wouldn't accept it."]
When he will die there will be no ROYAL  status to protect him and truth will come alive when the gates of HELL will open for him. / []
He actually chuckles when answering a question about his suicide.  "Epstein is dead....Chuckles.....how has this affected you?" / []
😆 / []
How did he know that picture was upstairs in that house / []
He’s saying we will overlook the nasty stuff because of the connections he was making, that in its self is a low down puddle / []
It would be a great interview if she had Charlie on chatting about his friendship with Savile 🤷‍♀️🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
"Absolutely no to all of it... " 😂 / []
13:43+ Sure looked like he knew who Mr. Brockman was to me! 👀 What was all that?!? / []
GUHL not him having such an interview in his mom’s house while wasn’t home! / []
Andrew should get checked for early onset dementia coz he can't remember shit / []
13:41 Busted😂 / []
My god absolute disgrace the lies and constant denial were painful to watch!!!  It was convenient for me to stay even after Epstein has been proven to be a sex trafficker and paedo ..... its more convenient to stop at a £40 pound Ramada Jarvis you paed#  And then it gets settled out of court disgrace to the already disgraced monarchy £12 million pounds for something he didn't do....and doesn't remember 😑 one of the dirtiest paedos on the planet trying to buy his victim!!! / []
Disgusting man, and the Royal Family walked with him to the church on Christmas Day, nah family my arse, to some family members you don't give them even the time of the day. / []
Interviewer: When was your last contact with Ghislaine Maxwell? Andrew: Earlier this year funnily enough. In the Summer. Spring/Summer. Interviewer: After he'd been convicted? Andrew: No, no, no. This was early Spring... I think. When was he arrested? Interviewer: July. Andrew: Nope, before then!  What an absolute clown this man is. / ['Spring summer is April /may', 'He is lying !!  They let him get a way!!', 'Spring is before July, Sherlock']
why is this man not in jail?????? / []
ive never been upstairs / []
remembers every time he didnt buy a drink? remind me never to go on a night out with this idiot / []
I love coming back for a laugh 😂 / ["it's not really  funny, pizza was code for trafficked children (remember pizzagate?) and adrenaline is the reason why vampires drink blood.. when the victim is terrified at the time of death"]
if he had any honour he wouldnt be here. / []
duke of york ?and I thought I'd fucked life. / []
all he had to do was keep his mouth shut,this idiot couldnt do that! / []
Oh, these royals... Where do we find a well sharpened guillo-T these days? / []
All I see ...... is a paedophile........nothing else .. / []
I have a feeling he knew who Mr. Brockman was based on 13:43😳 / []
I have heard ex personal protection officers saying he's the most arrogant person they have ever come across, know one liked him. / []
one of the good things that oaf Clarkson has done is punch Piers Morgan in the face,going of course here but I cant hear you Piers.Andrew is a nounce and what work do the royal family do?We do not need them they need to leech of us! / []
PA "I can't sweat after the adrenaline Rush from the Falklands War when I was shot at" BBC "Well, to be fair, you look like you're sweating right now" PA "I don't have any recollection of that, madam" / []
Classic.  Hilarious. / []
The more detailed a story is, the more likely it is to be made up. / ["@Ego_Sum_Nemo People who want to make up a story can spend as much time as they want beforehand thinking of what to say, so they tend to make up too many details because they think the more details, the more people will believe it.

No details even needed.']
Can not believe that all this people are still free!! Justice!! / ['She is a liar.']
A pity he wasn't asked on why he treats people so poorly and is an out and out bully because of his priveleged position !! / []
I don't sweat,overdose of 💩 / []
Rapist / []
And he is still a free man,oh boy,the privileges of being a part of the royal family / ['just the privileges of being rich tbh', '@Barra5122 Now to proceed to give lectures to third world countries about corruption. The irony.']
He is in the dark like everyone else. / []
The woman who is accusing him of this is a fraud and phony.  She just wants money and thinks if she makes these claims, she will be able to sue these wealthy men for a lot of money. / []
Not the ‘sharpest knife in the box’ is he / []
Lying Pettaass😛 / []
Wat  a  ffing a hole and utterly sad  human being / []
And now he’s banned from the royal family. This interview is a trainwreck by itself but now the king banning him is the nail in the coffin for this pedo / []
Why did prince Andrew settle for a Multi-Million £ deal?...Mmmm...Smells fishy children... / ['I believe the money went to a charity for victims of sex trafficking.']
GUILTY!. / []
Gotta love how the emphasis that the invitation was mainly for Ghislaine has aged pretty terribly. 😑 / []
Lock him up / []
I think Andrew is disgusting / []
This guy thinks we are idiots. The  photo of him is real but his hand is fake, anything about her he can’t remember but everything else he can remember, he looks so nervous when being asked about her, she’s proof against his lies and another person saw him getting a massage from a young Russian girl which he also said isn’t true. / []
Okay, let’s say he didn’t know of things Jeffrey was doing before his arrest and conviction in 2008…. But after Jeffrey did his prison time and was released, Andrew still remained his friend. WHY? Why would you remain friends with a convicted pedophile if you believe abuse is wrong? I just don’t get how he can sit there and deny what’s so damn clear.   He did sleep with an underage Virginia and he full on know what Jeffrey was doing. / []
Performed in a way that’s unbecoming. So, you think sex offender is just unbecoming? / []
I’m not a confrontational person but I went to confront Epstein face to face to end our relationship. / []
There are things now we face, that we didn’t face 25 years ago. Being caught for sex trafficking you mean? / []
How has this effected your family? It was a sore in the family, we all knew him.  She wasn’t talking about grieving for a sex offender you dolt. / []
40.23 oh wow I wonder what he was about to say at this mark 🤣 quickly checked himself the big old jowley creeper / []
There was nothing to talk about, we wanted to move on. But there was nothing to talk about cos he hadn’t been arrested at that point. Why did you want to move on then? / []
When was he arrested?  July. It was before July.  You said it was Spring/Summer, so you know when you had contact with them. But you waited for an accurate time before saying. / []
I'm autistic so struggle to tell these things but DAMN his lies are crystal clear 😂😂😂😂 like how did he know the photo with Virginia was taken upstairs if he was edited into it? / []
A nasty man.. / []
You wouldn’t need to think about it. You either did or didn’t. You’d remember. So, yes, you did it. / []
If you’re a man, it’s a positive action to have sex with someone.  So, men can’t be raped? That’s just insulting to suggest that male rape victims consented/let or wanted it to happen. / []
“I don’t think it happened at all”. So it could’ve done then? Think you’d remember yes or no if you’d had sex with someone. I remember every time I have, both good and bad.  So… / []
“I don’t remember a photo being taken”. So photos can only be taken of you if you’re aware of it?  You ever seen all the photos of celebrities on holiday or in street? You have journalists and paparazzi everywhere, all the time. / []
For something that wasn’t memorable with your kids…you remember it well. / []
Do you regret your friendship with a convicted sex offender? “No”.  🤔🤦‍♂️ / []
If you’re innocent. Why you stuttering so much? / []
He never went into detail about what I…he was doing.  So, you were involved then. / []
The way he talks about 'Mr. Epstein' makes it almost look like they more than friends rather than 'not even very close'. / []
Lying get / []
If the Epstein tapes were ever released, we would find that Prince Andrew is 1 of hundreds of powerful, wealthy people who engaged in activities with underage children. / []
Having watched this interview I felt so embarrassed at his squirming to try and get out of his association with JE.heaven knows what his ex wife and his girls and the royal family felt. The interviewer held it well as he was denied everything about the parties and comings and going’s in the house. What a sham! / []
Epstein was a guest at the palace??? 🙄🙄🙄🙄 / []
'Lair liar pants on fire' / []
First time watching this but it’s obvious he’s lying: he flashes too much with his eyes and looks downwards. / []
If he wasn't a royal he would be locked up / []
...I bet loads of Under-Age-Girls was Fucked-Up-The-Arse... / ['Wha?']
I cannot believe that he and his friends think this interview was a success.  This interviewer is a wonderful Rottweiler.  Andrew is not a match intellectually with her.  He deserves everything he got and gets.  He has gotten away with all sorts of poor behaviour all of his life.  And now … the fecal matter has hit the fan.  And why did he settle for bijillions of dollars with this poor wee girl?  Pathetic man. Mistake on his part to do this interview. / []
Oh dear.  Not the sharpest knife in the drawer.  Not unlike Harry … .  Poor judgment?  Tendency to be too honourable?  Ummmm. Thick as a brick.  This interviewer IS the sharpest knife in the drawer, however.  Poor old Andrew. / []
Shut up pedo / []
CRINGE.......!!!!!!!. / ['i agree mother']
Disgusting 'hiding behind privilege'!! Mummy bailed you out "'As always"!!!! / []
A man who disappoints himself in every single way. He has a strong need to conquer Lolita before they understand what sex is all about. It's his little secret. / []
If he did have sex or foot massage etc,. In Epstein house and island you can bet Epstein recorded it / ['Will Ghislaine be -offed- .......sorry commit suicide in prison?']
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍👍👍 / []
I can’t believe he thanked her at the end. This man in nuts / []
He did such a terrible job lying throughout the interview everyone knew he did it just minutes into it but when he started laughing that was the cherry on top he cooked himself / []

He wouldn't have done this, without his mothers permission. Which shows her contempt for the intelligence of the British public.

Andrew really believes if he could wipe the memory of her out of his mind he thinks he actually didn’t abuse this underage girl 3 times. What scary is he must of had 1000’s of girls he abused if he really cannot remember Virginia. He does remember exactly what happened but he can’t recall. Saying he doesn’t recall means he isn’t denying the allegations against him he just can’t recall the incident. What an absolute child sex offender kits like his friend Geoffrey. He should be locked away now his mum Has passed away but I guarantee the queen new about his abuse of young girls. Prostitutes were called to palace on the regular and Andrew would snort high grade cocaine and then have 10 to 15 minute sex with prostitutes as a retiree palace policeman who worked at the place witnessed most nights. Andrew cannot hide from the British public he face justice / []
Shame his nose doesn’t grow like Pinocchio’s 🤥 / []

Giving this interview was a massive mistake by prince Andrew. He behaved evasively with certain questions and he probably shagged some of the young WOMEN and you don't ask for ID before sex. The woman who said they had sex was 17 at the time so it was perfectly legal so he would have come out better if he'd owned having sex with her IMO. The woman in question was sexually mature and experienced and she was perfectly happy to sleep with anyone because she will have made good money with free drugs and private jets and yachts mixing with powerful billionaires.  I don't class what they did as trafficking because to me that's forcing women and girls to prostitute themselves without them getting paid. These young girls knew what they were there for and it wasn't their scintillating wit and stock market advice. They were mixing with people who could give them good jobs and expensive gifts. / ['This woman is making the whole thing up.']
It is easy to see he is lying through his yellow teeth / []

It’s funny that he’s steady trying  and failing miserably to explain away all his encounters w him inviting and hanging w Jeffrey as “it was all for Ghislane” “he was just a plus one” but Ghislane was just as big of a monster as Jeffrey if not more! So like how does you using her as a leaning post make you hanging out w either of them any better 🤷🏻‍♀️… 🤣 js… 💅🏻 / []
What a fn train wreck. Whomever told this idiot to do this interview ought to be thrown in the Tower. / []
His tendency to be “too honourable”🤣 / ["@Kellie Jackson I didn't laugh; I cringed..."]

Unbelievable!   No moral campus and so he couldn’t pick up on some really obvious cues, to condemn Epstein, to express regret, to show empathy for the victims.   Losing titles is not enough for this loser! / []
Harry and Meghan are hated more then this guy 🤣🤣😂 / []
He tried to distance himself from Epstein and pal up to Ms. Maxwell only to be brought down with her also. “Going to Jeffrey’s was not about a party.” Oh okay Andrew😂😂😂 / []
I knew i will be  Protected  How dare u I can do anything  I am a apecial / []
Lol his judgment was colored by his tendency to be “too honorable” / []
That neck has a zip code all its own / []
Watched this interview so many times. Just a brilliant bit of television, how can anyone be such an idiot 😂😂😂 / []
And they're saying that Harry and Meghan are destroying the monarchy...Please. / ['Destroying the monarchy is a good thing though', 'They are. As is Andrew.']
What a bumbling, stuttering mess... middle aged spoilt brat!!!!  They weren't very good friends, but hey, here's the keys to my home!! / []
He almost seems to be proud of the title “Partying Prince”. The reaction is similar to a narcissistic serial killer when a cop goes “you deceived us… what other murders have you committed?” / ['Yes. You put it in the right words.']
I did not realise that NYC did not have decent hotels for royalty. Maybe the add on extras were not convenient enough! / []
Drug addict and pedo / []
Funny enough... / []
Oh dear. He's not the brightest / []
he kept it quite about spray tan markle and epstein yacht  he needs speak F.B.I. / []
This man is so detached from reality and so arrogant that he actually thought the general public would find this convincing lol. He must be amazed we even know how to tie our shoes / ['😂', 'He was raised by his Mum.', "Well, yes cause he doesn't know how to tie his own shoes!", "@agatakozowska8320 yes, but no. He was raised by nannies that never disciplined him and had to bow and keep their heads down. \nElizabeth ll was first The Queen and then the mother and wife. And it's known that she was constantly absent in their children's lives.\nThat's why Diana princess of Wales never left her kids behind.", '@lauraklein4756 Do not look for excuses.']
now spray can markle  come out pedo Andrew epstein yacht   poor ginger uncle been there with spray can markle / []
My god this guy isn't the brightest. "That's the upstairs of the house". 2 seconds later..."I have never been upstairs in that house". / ['🤣🤣', "Borderline imbecile, I'd say..."]
In the olden days i think he would have lost his head. / []
Why people aren't so mean towards this pedo, as they are with HARRY AND Meghan.  This is vomiting, disgusting, this person should be in jail. When? Why the tabloids don't talk anymore about this pedophile, ah because he is the queens favourite son 💩💩💩🤮 / []
Bone in his neck 😂😂 / []
Objectively, who remembers “exactly” what they did, when wasted (drunk)? / []
Convenient amnesia -fast forward to 2021  when your mother the Queen paid £12m to bail you out of Potential PEDO CHARGES ! / []
You lying PEDO ,just like your father &  brother -all Scummy entitled lowlifes / []
He’s not a LIAR IS HE 😅😂🤣sweaty  qunt / []
SWEATING LIKE A RAPIST LOLO / []
This interview was hilarious, he should audition for SNL / ["it's not really  funny, pizza was code for trafficked children (remember pizzagate?) and adrenaline is the reason why vampires drink blood.. when the victim is terrified at the time of death"]
He shouldn't have done this interview though.... / []
Interviwer comes across as rather arrogant / []
Well whether or not she was 17...not an offence in the uk. Also this roberts girl was found to be lieing... / ['You are a disgrace to survivors of sexual abuse!!!!']
I will say though he shouldnt have done this interview... Never complain.... / []
Wasnt this roberts girl 17??? Not an offence then.... Legal age here 16.... / ['He stayed friends with a pedophile']
Shame on you.... prince andrew. You have no ethical morals. What's incredible is, he paid $20 million in settlement to the victim. But who's money is that? The British people, the hard working tax payers. feeding these luxury life style of so called the Royal Family...Its shocking how an entire nation support such cause???? Who needs it? / []
Guilty / []
Watch Filthy Rich Jeffrey Esptein the truth is there about Andrew. / []
Just lies after lies, disgusting / []
The British are cowards / []
Im guessing he was trained for hours for this interview by a team of public image experts. You can tell he was ready for many of the questions but truth is truth and you can see at the last of the interview how the awesome journalist shows his real side and he says epstien was indiscreet or inproper something to that effect, and she corrects him saying "inproper.!!..  he was a sex offender" the whole world was not there to witness any of the allegations but I am guessing nine out of ten people giving human nature and body language can see the evidence in his face and manurismns and I think its so shameful he walks around a free man. What kind of world is this where disparity of justice is granted to the rich and powerful. My heart goes out to the victim, my respect and admiration goes out to the reporter, and my disdain and discust to the prince of creepy. / []
Dear Andrew, You belong in jail / []
Great example of narcissism in action / ['I agree. You only have to watch the interview of his ex-protection officer. The way he spoke to these men, who put their lives on the line for his security, is an absolute disgrace. It shows how he views himself and us lesser mortals.']
When probed on why he chose to stay at a convicted sex offender’s house *Prince* Andrew replies “it was a convenient place to stay”. Because the queen’s son couldn’t have found residence elsewhere 🙄 / []
Throughout the course of this interview, he refers to the depth of his relationship with Maxwell. Now that she is convicted of child sex trafficing, will there be another interview with Andrew? / []
He can't have been at Tramp club because he doesn't know where it is. And when he has been there, he never buys drinks 😅 / ['Exactly. There’s pictures of him in that club drinking and sweating. Such a liar. It’s obvious he’s used to getting his own way and being “believed” regardless of what he’s done or not.', 'He’d have been loving The Chasers..\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28']
They are also humans.They also have weird attitudes like any of us. / []
Hmmm  a complete load of bullshit. / []
No shame no honor no moral compass disgusting disgraceful human behavior.... / ["He's just a derty nons like the rest of them. and he should of got lockt up and the hole world nose it. He let he's mum down big big time and engaland the people", '.']
The loyal royal sexual predator.. / []
The royal sexual predator.. / []
The favorite son doesn't have Mumsy to protect him anymore..... / []
Ah, but the true question is where did Epstein get his money and why did he blackmail Andrew as well as many implied others, most of whom we shall never know. The public is not as stupid as the Epstein killers like to think.  It's just an obvious revelation for many  as how the world is being run by greed and corruption. / []
I'm fascinated how famous people, political figures and other powerful men can seem to unconsciously sabotage themselves. Its like there's an unconscious part of them that want to be called out or exposed for  their dark secrets. Andrew had the perfect cover to keep silent as the royal family have a history of not commenting on stories in the press. He didn't have to do this interview but did where we all realised that this idiot is lying and that the allegations were probably true. / []
One of the greatest slow motion train wrecks in history. Thanks Andrew. / ['Great call…\nThis is what I saw:\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28', "Pity liar's don't have implanted air bangs", 'He’s very slow fortunately', '......lololololol......."I hadn\'t grown any feet then so I couldn\'t have been dancing!"\n.....and AS IF....." it\'s a stretch to say he was "close friends with Epstein".  HE WAS SO CLOSE that Epstein "kindly paid off"  P.A\'s ex-wife Fergie\'s HUGE debts though!', 'I know. Still so good!']
Such a bad liar...easy to profile, dance around  , he learned well from Eptstien / []
Nobody can touch him . His mother queen Elizabeth owns the court and prison. Also he paid money to the victim. We live in a horrible world and the rich famous get away with it. / []
This is a Set Up no Matter what you think! Prince Andrew is Innocent and Should be King Not Charles who doesn’t care about Britain or People. Charles was a friend of Epstein and I am looking forward for Harry telling the World! / []
but with Meghan you guys turn around faces just because is a woman and black. ipocrisie.just many people see a man lying. / []
You don't want to pull the thread of Ghislain Maxwell and her father, maybe one day the rotten core of the elites will be exposed / []
Smug .arrogant....lier ....nothing worse than this piece of shite ..thinks he is untouchable...and the sad thing is ..he basically is ain't he.... doesn't sweat ....haha I've heard it all.... hope the guy gets what he deserves.....he plays the poor me card...and it is so obvious..... he got caught out and can't own up ...the whole royal family is one big dodgy cult .they should have got rid of him ..but they don't..Says it all to me / []
This family- other than Harry and Meghan - are absolute garbage. Useless British welfare family, the phony "Windsors." Junk humans. / []
Watch an ex security detail police officer talking about protecting this piece of work. He was the Queen’s favourite. Had 74 penguins on his bed and the maid has to put it exactly in a way he wants. Verbally abuse to anyone. Rude, obnoxious and gapping A hole. Just tells you UK was a really unequal place. / []
You are who you hang around or surround yourself with / []
Yet Meghan is the one that destroyed the royal family 🙄 he didn’t get the hate as much as Meghan did and still is for doing absolutely nothing other than falling out with her in laws for stepping down as a senior royal. The math ain’t mathing / []
The Queen was even worse, I wish I could say RIP, but instead I say Rot in hell / []
this interview makes me feel so angry, because he got away with it! / ['And probably had part in Epstein not snitching']
This is why Harry and Meghan are the scapegoats. / []
The photograph was taken upstair, I dint think I ever went upstairs .... hahahahahhahahhaaha / []
If there was ever a bare faced liar ,,, here it is / []
15:29 "the fact of the fatter" / []
And these are the people being worshipped by no of people and govt is spending tax payers money for their luxurious lifestyle / []
I had to stay with the sex offender because my other friend the axe murderer was out of town / ['Lovely stuff!\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28']
His judgement is clouded by his tendency to be too honorable..... Ummm what? a / []
What a piece of lying shit. You are worse than Epstein. Arrogant fool / []
She is rightfully relentless yet elegant, mastery of interview <3 / ['As good as any top KC, if you know what I mean...If anyone out there does know what I mean, they will realise that my reference to a KC is something of an oxymoron in the circumstances.']
How was he found out???? / []
The fact the Elizabeth (queen) herself payed for him to be exempt from trial is the reason I'll never have respect for Elizabeth. / ["That's the nature of every mother in these circumstances. Her Majesty, the late Queen, did not prevent her son from donning the mantle of being a pariah in public...", 'You\'re right. She should have refused the money and insisted he gave a deposition - as he said in this interview he would be "duty bound to do". And she was all about honour and DUTY.']
Nnno. It was a shooting party. A straight forward shooting party. / []
Sometime I like to believe peoples lies.  Its easy to get by in the moment and not caring about their repercussions.  I imagine many people let lies reign as truth just to get by in the now.  This guy is a clown. / []
Make it public, Prince Andrew was hanging out of you early 2000.And he'll just give you 20mill.hahaha.lying basyard. / []
This makes me sick 🤮 / []
I think he just wanted to be friends with his good friend, or his friend gave him opportunities too good to say no to. I don't think he knew how old these girls were, but he's lying because it looks bad. / []
cool, so he dont know nothing, didnt see nothing. easy breazy. ur free to go. pedo! / []
Liar / []
Whoever alouded him to do this interview got beheaded l bet,, / []
WEIRD FETISH of Prince Andrew, his biggest "turn on" was being a human toilet for partners.  This dude is sick / []
It's pretty obvious that he is lying A LOT, just try to analyze his body language. I think the concept of royals is immoral, there shouldn't be such thing in our modern world. It's time to get rid of them. Not only that they live from tax payers money in insane and wasteful luxury but they also can't even behave and be human beings. It's beyond disgusting, his place is in a prison cell. / []
I am not British, aIam looking at this from the outside. Andrew was set up. Why is Meg not questioned about her time as a yacht girl with Epstine. Wasn't she providing  her services? What kind.? To who? / []
We should cut him some slack. He just wanted some girl scout cookies. / []
He's a bad liar. / []
The Royals cost the taxpayer £102.4m during 2021-22 – an increase of 17% from the previous financial year. That figure does not include security costs. Cost of Living Crisis?! / []
😂😂😂😂😂 this guy is such a liar. / []
Russell Howard s take on this is hilarious. / ['‘I bet he’s sweating now’. Golden line!\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28']
The instruction from Mummy is very clear: "Don't you dare implicate the Palace".  e.g 04:17,  10:53 / []
I'm 55 years old.. live a very quiet life, but if I was one on one I'd have to tell this mutt that he needs to go into a deep cave and stay. Reading about his behaviour towards staff and security at Royal homes is child like. He has his bed garnished with 70+ teddy bears that have to be put back precisely once bed has been changed. / []
I can't beleive he took him for a walk to awkwardly tell him that he can no longer be friends because it doesn't look good on him. Not "I can't be friends with you because you are a convicted sex offender and this disgusts me" / ['He stayed in his house to tell him they can’t stay together. LMFAO.', '“I can’t be friends with you because you are……… and this disgusts me” is such a cliche response. \nTruth is we’re all probably friends with someone who has committed a sex offence but just wasn’t caught/reported.', '@waynexl2641 Well no, I am rather certain I’m not in the company of anyone who would engage in such behavior. And “cliche” is so odd—would one not express disgust if a former friend was a convicted sex offender?', "As I've said before,  he should have said he just couldn't believe that Epstein would do such as thing, just as I'm accused. That would be a better lie", 'You have a good point there!']
This interview is the gift that just keeps on giving. It will never get old. / ['Same, I revisit this every few months lol', 'so true!  lol i havent watched it in a looong time so i decided to watch it again', 'Honestly mate, I come back every other month or so for a good 40 minute laugh!', "Haha that's a perfect phrase for it 😂\nIm glad Im not the only one re watching!", '@FreeKarenReadxxx Should never worry about what other people think. If it works for you enjoy it 😎']
snap in its finest   guilty as shit     nice try    regardless bless you Andrew Amen. / []
What an absolute sausage!!! / []
When he mentions that Epstein has the ability to bring people together including united nations people my thoughts 💭 were  I want the united nations to be run by the public and be a general people's organisation and not run by people who control the world. / []
Its difficult to believe this man. Esp when Jeffery isn't alive to say otherwise. / []
Another bad decision to do this interview...doesn't know the bar in Tramp ?? but yet confirmd he never bought a drink in Tramp... / []
What a nasty bit of work , shame he’ll never be accountable for his crimes! Did enjoy watching him sweat though, I mean squirm 🤔 / ['I viewed this entire interview through the following filter:\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28']
Have a look at the fat, loser. At least he’s mummy’s favourite. / []
This is a Titanic disaster of an interview, many years in the making, iceberg right ahead, it didn’t take 2 hours for him to sink, he was taking on water quickly because he forgot to close his watertight compartments he then clearly forgot to launch his lifeboat 😂 let’s get the violin out / ['Have you seen that film, Titanic? Just kidding- loving the comment 👍🏻.\nYou may enjoy this take on the shipwreck:\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28']
It's a bad idea when cousins marry. / []
Disgusting. And the fact that the media only prints news about Megan and Harry and nobody talks about this pedo!!!! / []
A convenient place to stay? With his money he could’ve stayed anywhere, instead he chose to stay at sex offenders home! Great people, eh? / []
U had to go see him🧐red flag straight up....would of love to of been a fly on the wall......how much shit did they delete another thing I believe he is was heavily involved with operation yew tree and I believe that's how he was caught / []
Dont particular like the royal but that scum bag took a couple of years off his mums life period / []
He's quite the smooth talker... 😎 / ['Really? Would you like to borrow my hearing aids?']
Andy you are a terrible liar / []
21:23 my favourite part lmao / ['🤣🤣']
The man is a liar look at the way his face n voice changes when she says certain words towards children and his connection with Jeffrey / []
how this man lies / []
Just goes to show the Royals would have nothing to share if it wasn't for Princess Meghan and Prince Harry they add spice to a rather boring lot :) / []
this guy is an idiot / []
You can see the evil in his eyes / ["Yeah you can also see the evil in the mousy looking bitch's eyes too (aka Ghislaine maxwell)"]
He is such a lying toe-rag. / []
Funny how noone who he trafficked to has been named.........hmmm I'll just go back to sleep / []
I find it incredulous that Prince Andrew says that he couldn’t have danced with Virginia As he “couldn’t sweat at the time”, and yet his medical and legal team could find no evidence of his “condition” in his medical history/record. I can imagine the ridonkulous medical care the royal family have access to, surely there’s no way this wouldn’t have been recorded. / ['Added to the unfortunate pictures that emerged right after this interview of him in various night clubs during this time frame absolutely dripping in sweat.', 'Ridonkulous?..', 'it could be code for something,  like pizza']
40:38 when he laughed at journalist's words that Epstein died...  🤯 huuuuge relief / []
Lying is a visual and this m’fer’s in ULTRA HD / []
He is simply a disgusting individual / []
BBC sugarcoating a paedophile,  Andrew belongs in jail . / []
I don’t believe a thing / []
It's like a sequel to a bad movie. Call it JIMMY SAVILLE  2 / []
I am  not saying he is guilty or not guilty but why did he not fight his corner  why did he pay her and do that interview why did he stay for 4 days after the debacle he knew that he was a peado and why did you not just phone him and tell him you wanted nothing to do with a person who was a convicted pedophile  I mean the. Sweating bit how come other soldiers that's Been shot at didn't get it its a mystery / []
47:59 / []
If an 8 year old showed this type of disposition while explaining why they didn't turn in their homework, the punishment would be dealt before they finished the excuse. Matter fact an 8 year old might've handled this interview better 😂 / []
Blagger / []
You have to remember Andrew had a lot of women in his day and there was one every week. It’s all very well knowing what we know now but he wasn’t into kids that age hell no he was pictured all the time with girls his age. No he wasn’t a peodo I don’t believe it for a min and he knew where he stood in the royal family. Even his ex wife lives with him and his two daughters til they got married. No I don’t believe it. Epstein had many friends. And because he’s royalty got dragged in. Media liked that shit. Pin it on him. She said he said / ['Then why was he hanging out at the pedophiles house for 3 days… “it was a convenient place to stay”', 'How did he know that photo was taken upstairs in Ghislanes house ?']
Wtf this man really thinks we are believing it lmao / ['@CancelRevival are you deaf or did you not watch the interview']
No sweat 😲 / []
He is nothing but a British Bill Cosby in my eyes...   They both got away with it. / []
Creepy, deceit fool should have kept quiet. Now we know. Obnoxious 👹lizard. / []
15:06 "Again, new information has come out since I had him killed..." / []
This guy would be a police interviewer's dream. He's the worst liar I've ever seen. / ["@CancelRevival Good evidence is the  prosecutor's dream. The interviewer just needs to know they have the right person and the more lies they tell the better."]
he looks like a naughty school boy when he was blinking when asked stuff he done it / []
Henry the 8th proud of this man, he continue the great heritage of power. / []
blinking eyes Andrew / []
Prince Andrew on my eyes full of lie to the Queen / []
This interview is spectacular.  Prince Andrew is the smartest man in the room. The gravitas is deafening. / []
Fascinating to see how his manner changes from the start to the end. But when the interview is wrapped up, like a small boy allowed to leave class, he seems to think it's all over... well, it was. / []
I don't believe him / []
Iv seen a clip from tramps of there cctv HE WAS THERE / []
HE IS KING IF CHARLEY IS ILL. WOW. / ['No he isnt']
liar / []
lol oh my why would he do this interview? / []
If he didn’t have anything to do with this, the dirty work, he would have brutally honest about the details even if that meant throwing others under / ['Not just that, but he would’ve spoken to the FBI… it’s been over 3 years and yet he’s still dodging the FBI and avoiding flying into the US because he knows he’ll be detained.', 'If I was a friend of Epstein but didn\'t know he was a criminal, my first words in that interview would have been "screw that guy, I\'m glad he\'s dead". Andrew can\'t even bring himself to say he regretted the friendship.']
it was the wrong thing to do  but was the  honorable right thing to do ,   inside the mind of a lieing peadophile / []
him and jimmy saville  patrons of royal society for protection of children, thats how sick and perverted these peados actually are / []
when he says  and when he was thier was no indication, but if thier was ... yeah / []
who actually advises these royal persons? / []
Just watched the interview with the police security head. Andrew sounds like a totally horrible person! / ['What interview is that ?']
What a theatrical compulsive liar he is! An entitled mommy's boy brat who got away with minor assault. / []
"UPSTAIRS????" / []
But i will use loads of money to pay her off. Because i can..... DISGUSTING.................. / []
"In the Navy?????" He was the one in the barrrel.............................. Disgusting Worm. / []
How come hes not died in a tunnel?...or some other accident????? / []
21:35 ... this moment just speaks for itself. / ['The desperation jumped all the way out.', "Haha he's never been called out on his lies and it shows.  What a rubbish liar 😂", '@boahnation9932 you’re exactly right.

I'd bet he has done things to young ladies probably even on his own staff sick MF'er! Definitely there's more women he's done this to times he's not even been around jeffrey.. So sorry to all you women that they did this to, I'm sorry and stand with you! / []
He didn't sweat at the time lol 😆 😂 really dude really "atleast back then"😅 😂 He was embarrassed of that?? why tf he felt he had to make a statement on it instead of trying to convince us he didn't sexually abuse this child is soooo crazy! This man is disgusting everything he says is just disgusting!!!! Also I didn't hear not one thing about how he was disgusted or ashamed to be friends with jeffrey either shame on you and your lies!!! You P.O.S.! / []
Big fat liar / []
What an absolute legend / ['She’s awesome isn’t she 😎']
WTF??!!  An employee of Epstein's saw Andrew engaging in foreplay with a young girl  at Epstein's private island.  Is he on drugs? / []
Okay - what an ASS! / []
What a great actor an Oscar fantastic / ['I disagree the acting was absolute rubbish', 'How is this good acting? It’s atrocious acting', "@steverobinson9836 pretty sure he's being sarcastic 🤣"]
get rid of the monarchy , they're a disgrace / []
He is absolutely disgusting! / []
The rule since 1969 was "What happens in Tramp stays in Tramp' Oops / []
He went to see him in 2010 to try and cover his own rear. He was concerned about what Epstein might share about his involvement and wanted to talk to him in person. It was total self preservation. Andrew deserves much more than he has received so far. The man is a predator. / ['Good point.  I wondered why he HAD to go talk in person.']
This interviewer should receive some sort of medal and also a security team so she doesn’t get in a ‘wreck’ in a tunnel somewhere.  Actually she should probably just move to the US. We will gladly accept her with full citizenship.  She is iconic / ['Tin foil hat alert!', "@balalunga1 People have gone missing for less, ain't that farfetched", '@carlbennett2479 If i’m not mistaken Emily Maitlis is still doing fine.

This interview is like fine wine..It gets better with age... / ['Ikr xD', 'Consider this some bubbly on the side:\nhttps://youtu.be/zO7CP8W1P28', 'Unlike girls, amiright']
He’s a bad dude / []
He is a sleezy liar. / []
He knows everything and he was as much a part of this ring as the others / []
He's a lying,cheating snake and should be in prison in my opinion. / []
You are a rude, self centered , spoiled piece of crap! How your Mother chose you as her favorite child baffles me. What an insult to her other children!! You are an ignorant, embarrassing, fool who brought shame to your Family! You were always the self centered, hateful person who really thought you were above everyone your entire life!! Just fade away, you won’t be missed. / []
12.28 - the look when someone gets caught out and you can see the smug little expression creeping in. What a slimy little man he is. / []
Oh ffs.. Wtf / []
He's disgusting he should be locked up! / []
Why do you guys still a monarchy over there? It just sounds like extra taxes and extra steps. Also, immunity for those within that sick circle. / []
Why is this bloke not in jail? Why is this bloke not getting the ol' french treatment? / []
"There was no indication about that at that time, to me or anybody else". How can one be so sure that other people did not know about it, unless you're trying to get yourself out of trouble? / []
One of Prince Andrew's police security guards describes what it was like to work with Andrew in Buckingham Place on a day-to-day basis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY-Jk3Ubs4U -- it's eye-opening stuff. Andrew is rude, dismissive and obnoxious! / ["Just watched that interview and it's very eye opening how much was known at the time about his actions"]
Epstein died in jail supposedly committed suicide , the camera on his cell went down and the guard was missing ) course he died with secrets of the rich perverts he knew all about) a man like Epstein ?? Would really end his own life ) don’t believe an ounce of it . / []
End taxes bring reform and stop taking money off the public to pay these layabouts spoilt brat so called “royals” UK government are a disgrace to keep it going. / []
This stupid slave puppet servicing her masters was very kind to the "royal pedo" yet hard and infinitely bias against the free self determination of Hungary... No surprise https://youtu.be/q8itF62yIJg / []

Would love to hear a DING go off every time he lies. I predict a lot of dings. / []
Has he had Beatrice?? / []
He loves underage girl's / []
Look at the bags under his eyes lol / []
Why aren't all convicts released from prison if he and Bill Clinton Bill Gates aren't imprisoned?? Nonsense / []
“ white man’s world”- 2pac Shakur / []
End comment " I think you dragged out".  Strange words to say. He probably needed a foot massage after this😁 / []
Terminal Leave from the navy. He phoned mummy and said I can’t finish my whole term here please get me out!!!!! / []
Ah yes I remember the pizza express!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Look at Andrew what an idiot. He can’t even lie convincingly and his excuses are laughable. / []
What he was saying about the media near the end was the media isn’t a print media now and he can actually get caught doing sexual activities with all the new technology with the modern media. When he said because if that you have to have a thick skin really meant he knows he will get caught today today but he will just deny any allegations. That’s why he had a tough skin. Years ago you couldn’t get proof 25 years ago no pictures or people to testify their abuse. Andrew and the royal family have a deep deep rabbit hole that most normal people will not let their brains digest. Look at balenciaga now how they have used children to use their satanic cult. / []
Loooooooool so he went to stay with him just to break up the friendship with Epstein 😂. Insulting the public’s intelligence. ‘It was a convenient place to stay’ 😂 / []
The fuck is this shit. / []
"Just a straightforward shooting weekend"  Oh, well if it was just a shooting weekend.... / []
Borat has more self awareness. / []
Wait..he had just said he had already told epstein he would not be in touch with him again because  he was heading to jail. Then he must have got in touch with him when he got out of jail. Then he decides to go over to spend 4 days with him to tell him  once again, he wasn't going to be friends with him. He had already cut ties. Knew he was a criminal. But wanted to be with him again post jail. Liar. You don't spend 4 days in a known pedos home waiting to speak with him for half an hour. Convenience. Liar. / []
not really human, hes a lizard person / ["I've got a feeling you're not being ironic"]
I'm ARRIVING, I'm ARRIVING,!!! Oh paahdon Me, I must have been DEPARTING.  I just can not recall. "I've never been upstairs because as you all well know, as a Royal, we absolutely do not use a staircase, but rather an elevator and If I'm correct, I do not believe my (not) friend Epstein has an elevator in his abode".  What an absolute disgrace to humankind.  This guy is a dirtbag of the worst kind, a lying sack of feces. / []
Horrible, vile, narcissistic lying prick who thinks he can do whatever he wants, hope one day he is held accountable for his actions. / []
Jimmy Saville was a good friend of the royals,says it all really.Horrible individual. / []
He''s a horrible person and horrible liar / []
He’s so fuckin’ vile! YUCK.  in solidarity with the victims! / []
I don’t understand why he doesn’t just come out and tell the truth. It’s the only thing he has left. This man is truly pathetic. / ['Jail time', 'death by the same way JE went..']

A first class liar and a truly horrible human being. / ['If that’s a first class liar I want to see what a bad liar looks like😂']
He's lying 😂 / []
Her: How guilty are you?  Him: Yes / ['he dined and had sex with the girl']
How the interviewer didn’t laugh during the Pizza Express and sweating lies is beyond me! Give this woman a huge journalism award! / ['Hahaha 💯', 'It’s because Prince Andrew has a tendency to be “too honourable”.', 'I cudda swore I seen his nose go longer n longer n longer, , , , ,', 'what is it with pedophiles and pizza? thats their perfered bait', "pizza was code for trafficked children, don't forget he had an overdose of adrenaline too, which can be/is taken from the blood of people who died in fear, so I've heard"]
Watching this again November 28, 2022 and JFC he's lying his ass off. / []
He comes through as someone who is lying and been counseled extensively as to what to say. He NEVER shows any remorse to the young girls who were sex-trafficked. He even stayed at Epstein residence after he was convicted on these extreme offenses!  Everyone will remember his connection and his reputation is ruined forever. / ['..they told him to mention pizza and adrenaline I think']
His face turns red. He is definitely lying. / []
🔔🔚 / []
Why this man has not been arrested? They are all talking about "horrible" Megan Markle and this teen molester is still living his high life. Beautiful world we live in. / []
Absolutely innocent.  So many people do anything to get a bit of notoriety and cash. / []
Taking a walking in the park, in the public eye talking about "We can't be seen together " / []
“I’ve never felt the need to go and pah-tee” 2:55 / []
What the hell is he talking about. I can't believe that he thinks we could believe that we are not being hoodwinked by him. / []
the body language, the breaking of eye contacts, and the facial expressions say it all. / []
He is NOT a very good liar! / []
Why no inquiry , if innocent nothing to fear ! but he chooses to continue to live in a world of suspicion was the truth worse ?. / []
He coulda stayed at any hotel. / []
Lies / []
He can remember 2006 but can't remember V Robert's. / []
Ugh he's such a liar / []
I'm just too honorable 🙄🙄🙄 / []
UR a  Is pedophile keep talking.. just another example  Of  Elites of the World 🌎 who think  they are Smarter than all of Us & Were All Stupid Yeah Keep talking  straight into UR  jail Cell.. Only Excuse he doesn't say is  "Ask my wife  if  I sweated  in 2010." LOL / []
*I find it funny how he keeps saying "because of his girlfriend" when we now know that Maxwell was just as guilty as Epstein! if not more because she would traffic the girls* / []
*Electric Chair* / []
*I would have asked if Andrew would leave his own daughters to stay with Jeffrey Epstein!* / []
"I flew to tell him we couldn't be seen together"  And then...  Snapped in the park together.   You couldn't make this sh%t and his other countless contradictions up. / []
Andrew =     W⚓️ / []
He knew more than what he's letting on and he did more than he's letting on. He is just as guilty as Epstein!!! / []
What an arrogant jerk. / []
Wow it's all about him. Doesn't see the shame he's brought his family or give any regard for the victims. / []
He blinks too much, and looks at the floor and laterally, but never really faces her for long enough.! He speaks slowly, carefully choosing  his words, tries to hide behind  selected words,  suggested doubt rather  than lies, as, " He was not sure that he attended" then, "it being a dinner" and "not a party" when he was  the guest of honour!   He was lost for words, saying that , " I had to show leadership"  when there was no one to lead, as  he acted and he went alone!!!    His mental age is far below his physical age. He knows exactly what he did, was caught and is now acting  like a puppy with his tail in between his legs, feeling somewhat guilty, but not fully guilty, as his lack of  inherent human sensitivity  does not permit  him, and it seems to be a congenital mental disorder,  Being somewhat spoilt and blinded by his Royal benefits and upbringing, he misinterpreted his role in society  and he lived his life using  uncalibrated  non standard social measures.  When questioned he is behaving exactly like Bishop Peter Ball and Cardinal George Pell and all those that assisted them!!!. Many people sailing in the same boat of "social power" react in  the same manner when they have to face the social storm of their own doing.! It is a pity that many "grown ups" think that they can behave as they do, without being recognised by the more sane people around them!!!  A Sane Mentality is not achieved through Power , nor Richness, nor Royalty As the court said in cases like this, " There is Evidence but there is no Proof!" and the Higher Archy, including Parliament, House of Lords, Church members and King, who supported the people mentioned, tried to get out of it by saying, "We have been misled!"  A centralised system has its darkest side. / []
Dismal turd. / []
This video has semented the public's opinion of this awful person's privileged life! / []
'Considerable stretch' is exactly what this dh  deserves  - at his majesty's pleasure / []
Interesting that nary an attorney was in earshot of this interview. This was the brainchild of people doing their own thing without any input of reliable council. / []
And we thought like a Prince he would charm his way out of his long line of lies, but really a pretty scared dude is sitting in the chair right now / []
Prince Andrew is 🪛🪛🪛 ed / []
I'm sure the Queen cried buckets because of him and his acts. / []
"i'm a victim of being so honourable - I gave up 4 days of my time to tell someone i am not going to have anything to do with them, someone who i am not really friends with in the first place - i was just friends with his girlfriend. So, the basic order is:  Eps got convicted of sex trafficking, when he got out of jail Andrew went there and had 4 days of sex acts and attended a dinner CELEBRATING A SEX TRAFFICKER BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON, then getting caught out later one ... then, we get to see him having no idea how to cook up any kind of convincing fake story but, for some inexplicable reason, thinking he will ace being interviewed by Newsnight. / []
Someone should have turned up the thermostat to 90degrees to test the sweating excuse. / []
lying to his back teeth / []
Who would remember having pizza one night a years previous 🤯 this is like watching a child trying to worm his way out of getting told off / []
These people who speak up about what Andrew was up to, should be afraid for their lives. Sick a** peds / []
Entitled arrogant no class piece of crap. / []
As a German, I really don't understand why you all play "Hang him higher" with him. That girl is not really an "innocent" victim, but took a bunch of money for having sex as a slightly underage girl. Ok, it's illegal (if it happened), but worse things happen. And to all the witnesses telling "I saw Andrew being massaged by an underage girl" or "Jeffrey's home was an obvious children bordello" - where do you have you information from, why did you not intervene yourself when facing such inappropriate manners? Of course, Prince Andrew could have been prepared better, there were some inconsistent and funny excuses and defenses, making the Prince a nice meme. However, he did not deserve this kind of contempt. / ['Someone needsa to check your browser history', "OMG!!!!!!!     You are a total idiot and loser! Are you on Paedo Prince's payroll???"]
Liar / []
"My tendency to be too honorable" 🤣🤣 / []
HA HA HA HA HA Mr Wonderful trying to look so innocent, What a total disgrace / []
There you go. He doesn't remember so it didn't happen. Case closed😂😂 / []
Him and his entire family are repugnant, as it were. / []
Is there anyone anywhere that believes this guy? / []
Oh he is so full of BS. / []
What a liar. / []
Omg! Seeing a guy who lives an ocean away, 3 times in one year would not be a very good friend!…they would be as close as family.  My daughter lived 3600 km away and we only saw her 2 - 3 times per year. The guy is unbelievable. / []
Around 9 minutes,when he speaks about his walk in the park with JE was probably when there were arrangements made for bribary payments to JE. What a joke this person is / []
6:01.  Freudian  slip?  " getting rid of abused children" / []
Andy has gotten away with shit all his life.  Feels he can talk his way out of these things.  We see what you are. / []
It seems as if he was coached thoroughly before the interview, lest it got out of control and he flies off the handle. / []
Ghislaine Maxwell is going to have to testify. She might throw Prince Andrew under the bus. I'm sure she will share who was involved in abusing minors and trafficking girls to try to get a better deal for herself while she rots in prison. / []
Sex addicts are very good at "forgetting" things.  "I can't remember" is a super common response. So convenient.  They lie to others. They lie to themselves. And they've lied so many times to themselves that they start to eventually convince themselves the lies are the truth.  It is very easy for sex addicts to forget the "sex acts" they participated in because it goes against every single moral code they say they ascribe to uphold. It's a delusion of self if that is even possible. His interview is classic.  He got caught holding the bag but yet he's gaslighting everyone.  It's the ultimate form of reality manipulation. And, it's abusive behavior any way you slice it.  He proved he was lying by paying out money to keep his victims from testifying in court. Absolutely pathetic. And, Prince Andrew won't get better until he checks himself into a sex addiction treatment center. His legacy is ruined. But, at least at this point in his life, he can save himself by getting help. Unfortunately the same can not be said for Jefferey.  His addiction was so entrenched he would rather take his life rather than face the whole world and feel the shame of what he had done. But for any sex addict, it starts with being honest with themselves. The addiction bubble needs to pop. He needs help. He is leading a double life. And he won't get well until he gets into treatment. Period. / []
He says he's an honourable person. He's even lied to himself. Pathetic. / []
OMG - this interview is a bunch of complete lies.  If he was hooked up to a polygraph he'd FAIL at every single question. What a loser!   Liar. Liar. Pants on fire.   Don't we wish his pants would catch on fire?  How come that never happens to liars? / []
He's gaslighting the whole time!!!!! Sex addicts lie. They lie a lot.  The prince is a sex addict. / []
This guy is so full of Sh*T. Spoiled brat thinks he's entitled to everything and can get away with everything. He's as guilty as can be. Every question from the interviewer made him drown in his own words... Gloobluhhlawblooh!  Prince of nastiness! / []
This is the interview equivalent of what Jeffrey Epstein did to himself in that jail cell. The permanence of that action will last for eternity. And for Andrew, the enduring impact of this interview will continue to remind humanity of his inhumanity.   I’m glad his victims found their voice and their resilience to out survive them both. / []
This man looks and sounds so dumb! / []
This is truly awful to watch. Prince Andrew should not have done this interview because he looks very guilty. / []
What a nob !! / []
Plain and simple this guy is a pedophile thank you for the upload we love you in Peterborough Ontario Canada😘😘🇨🇦🇨🇦😘😘 / []
“He wasn’t a good friend of mine. But I had to do the honorable thing and fly to New York to break up with him in person.” ??? Such a joke. / []
I’ve watched this interview so many times and it’s still so cringeworthy. *ArrogantAndy* digs himself a deeper hole every time he opens his mouth with his obvious lies/ stuttering. / []
Conveniently out of the  headlines / []
10 sec looking at this mug you can tell he ain't good / []
You where guest of honour at a party? 🤴No no (I wasn't there) it wasn't a party their where only 8 of us having dinner. I had a scotch egg and cress that made me fart and follow through. Then I had some jelly Trifle while playing footsie with someone's wife. I then had a cheese board coffee mints and a Havana cigar. But I don't recall being there in 2010. Oh yes I was there yes that was the night after my trifle I tried to get one of the young maids to give me a handjob behined the dinning room curtains. Mmmm I didn't get one though as epstien was getting one from maxwell. Only so much curtain to hide behined so Jeffers got first pull. / []
I didn't watch this at the time... cause I really don't care.  But, I will say... If you have never been upstairs at a house of a friend of yours... how can you then say with total certainty that the picture in question was taken upstairs at that house.  How would you know?  He says it repeatedly.. and I quote..."It was taken upstairs at her house"  Really, if the picture was "doctored" and that was not really you... and you have no memory of the picture ever being taken... how can you say WHERE it was taken then??? / []
You could have just about any high ranking official, celebrity, elite business man,  etc in the chair. That's the game . HRH Prince Andrew actually said that anyone who was anyone was at the "parties" and that's why he went. To meet the industrial and political elite. / []
We're is the footage of Andy waving the girl good-bye. That was deliberately set up. Terrible Scum this man / []
Why He's not angry at this girl is a mystery!! / []
Immunities cost is the suffering of others at their cost. / []
Out of touch Out of order Out of time / []
"Just a straight forward shooting weekend...." Of course, we completely understand! / []
How many lies can you cram into one interview? / []
Love watching these entitled individuals dig there own graves, it’s like watching a blood sport 😂 / []
So he had royal security everywhere in the park and no-one could possibly have come near him, yet he stayed in a large townhouse described by him as a 'train station' because people were coming and going. From a safety viewpoint, that doesn't add up. / []
Prince sxdrew / []
"My tendency to be too honourable" is quite a narcissistic statement. / []
The fact that the interview was his idea shows how deluded he is. Glad he did it though. Did himself no favours at all. / []
Can’t these royals conduct any charity business without having another dinner party? / []
13:40 lmao / []
A man who never had to explain himself finally held to account. Love it! / ['Held to account..... Really', 'Held to account for what, exactly? That woman has since been proved to be a liar, and even if he did have sex with her 17 is not below the age of consent. There are 16 year olds pushing prams around everywhere in the U.K. and the US and nobody is chasing the fathers around. Nobody would even be interested in this if he wasn’t a royal.', 'he was giving coded messages', 'Vote Republic UK ( Not My King ! )', '\u200b@davecanly7535 He got kicked out of the big royal house. Wow what a punishment lol.']
17 = “sex trafficking” 18 = “meh, it’s ok”.  He should have postponed his visits for a year and he would have been fine. 😂 / []
This is a police interview without a lawyer / []

The question was asked ..Do you regret becoming friends with Harvey?  🤴 answered squirming, stuttering, adjusting in his seat. an just them,  it came to him. As his mind remembered the endless orgys he experienced. 🤴  mind said,  Shhhhhhhid.  (If it wasn't for you meddling kids.)  I'd still have my good thing.🤨    🤴  you too much!!! 🤣🤣🤣 / []
I'm sure that recollection is Andrews favourite word. / []
Liar , what an evil soul. Look at his face these no bit of light or brightness just totally dullness, If someone Accuse me of a crime like this and I knew I was innocent I would  certainly not believe like this “desensitized ”  I would be absolutely Furious and I’d tell the world how the crime is disgusting and evil it is. makes me sick to my stomach ,  There’s not bit in the interview where he shows a little emotions for the victims instead he’s so smug caught up in his own lies what a disgusting person . A person who associates himself with friends like Epstein Will NEVER make you an “honorable” person in the first place, what is he on about ! May God expose him , to think we have people like him in power no wonder things are the way that they are in the world .   “Enjoy what is good and forbid what is evil”   -fellow humans don’t forget about this criminal - forgetting about is way they get away with it. / []
Dirty disgusting peado along with the rest of your sick racist family., / []
The way he turns his head and stares back at her in his final response at the end, is terrifying / []
He’s so full of shit it stinks / []
this interview completely exposes his lack of responsibility for his disgusting actions and his total disregard for other people, his disgust in being questioned is undeniable, he should have been locked up!! how the privileged live / []
hah the teddy bear royalty / []
His dumb answer is covinent place to stay there was no hotels in New York / []
This idiot never prepared for this interview. Thought he was the smartest person in the room.  The arrogance….. just keeps digging the hole deeper and deeper. / []
He says, “that couldn’t have happened because I don’t know where Tramps (nightclub) is”. Then a few sentences later he says, “I don’t think I’ve ever bought a drink whenever I was there” (at Tramps nightclub). Very convincing. / ["Didn't he mean Working?", '@Emma-dv2yh No and you mean Woking \nyou spoon']

Total liar / []
We all wonder te same / []
Trump can do a better job than him in responding to the reporter. / []
“it was a convenient place to stay”….priceless delusion from Andrew / []
He has such a bad Memory, how many times did he say I dont remember 🤣🤣 Just because you don't remember doesn't mean it didn't happen. / []
I heard somewhere that Fergie talked him into this interview...that woman played the long game of revenge to the point of it being an Olympic marathon, if that's the case. / []

Very bad Andrew did all he did. I will never support such an evil act. But how old was Prince Andrew  at the time he commited the offence ? Not too many. How many men or women could throw a stone they never committed an act such as Andrew did?  What was the responsibility of the parents of the so called minors expecially their mothers ? Why are the minors keep gping back for more ?  Why waiting so long to open up ? Why is it ok at the time the act was of benefit  to the minors and not ok now ?  The normal instinct for every minor is to cry for help or run away from what they do not like, so what happened ? Perhaps, their parents are enjoying the gifts of a bramd new phone or their children supplenting grocery or house rent. By the way, when a woman commits the same offence, who talks much about it ?  Karen Ellis and Mary Kay Le Tourneaux got 6-24 months in jail for even worse act with a 12 and 15 years old boy and were allowed to reunite with same boys. What is the society teaching our children ?  There are more to be highlighted than this interview. Shame on Andrew and more shame on those who refused to focus on the essentials that will train our youngsters in identifying the right path. Period. / []
Honestly I feel bad for the Queen.. absolutely worthless sons.. Charles and Andrew should have been born to Indian mothers - they would have been straightened in a day… / ['Haha soo true..']
This is the first time I’ve seen this interview and I’ve heard people say how bad it is, but I never really imagined that it could be that bad. I was like people got to be exaggerating.  They weren’t. Its 10 times worse. This is the equivalent of a car crashing and a train hits the car and then someone blows the car up with a rocket launcher. / ['I was the same….just thought people were making a big fuss of nothing.

You are liar this is sickening / []
No indication RIGHT🤣 / []
Why this British taxpayers put up with this dont get it!!!!!! Doing work hahahhaha / []
“I don’t remember this,” is very different from “I didn’t do it.” You can tell from facial expressions, contradictory statements, and every sentence that he’s lying. I’m shocked he even approved this video to be aired we he looks so blatantly guilty. / [".because he didn't really want to do it, but he had some things gs to sat regarding pizza and adrenaline"]
What if your or my friends were turned out to be one a pedo?   You wouldnt be interviewed, but probably by the police with the same questions.  Elitism sucks in so many ways / []
So is he really, really a pedophile or not? Just saying. / ['PEDO    !']
40:35 Sounds relieved he finally died / []
The amount of times he goes "umm" or stutters his words is astounding. / []
The fact that his ex is still covering for him / []
It seems he is unaware , i believe it is not unbelievable. Wwe all do hindsight guessing....i did it yesterday  i thought out something and it was not as i thought..... / []
"There was absolutely no indication! And if there was....."  Ick / []
Clearly the fake-not-fake photo was taken to memorialize that important milestone in a decades long friendship where you truly open your hearts and step into each others’ second floor dining rooms for the first time. Real inner sanctum stuff. That also clears up the “I’m wearing traveling overseas clothes not going out in London clothes” conundrum.  Everyone knows the dining room friendship ceremony is business casual. / []
" I have this peculiar affliction whereby I can only remember things when they happen in Woking" - Prince Andrew / []
So he wasn’t that close of a friend but he HAD to go and see him to tell him why he could no longer be associated with him and stay at his house. Yep that makes perfect sense. One day this guy must face justice as well as all the other “extraordinary” people Epstein brought together. / []
This guy smells like a pedophile from a mile away. / []

You don't need a lie detector or truth serum, this guys body language tells the whole story. He is a bald faced liar! / []

And did he face any consequences? No. So what was this interview? Who really decided this could take place? / []

“Hello Prince Andrew, I’m a convicted sex trafficker now, so I suppose you won’t be wanting to stay the night here”  “Naaaaaah will be fine, convenient innit” / []
He's desperately trying to remember all the lines they've told him to say. / []
Both laughable and embarrassing. He is really not that bright, why did he ever agree to the interview 😂 / []
I know how they child traffick.. / []

How Dare you! You went positively there, disgusting / []
Prince Andrew should never be allowed to be around young people again.  The Queen was not amused with his behaviour. / []
You disgust us. Go away and disappear.  You hurt the monarchy more than promiscuous  Margaret, Chester and the lier Charles!!! / []
Hands down at 21:36 in my opinion is the most iconic part of the interview when he said there's a slight problem with that then he goes on to say he got some kind of condition where he doesn't sweat and clearly in the interview you can see he's starting to sweat from the questions LOL what a disgrace I'm so glad he got called out and I hope he faces whatever he's done and if it's true he should also face the courts along with his old pal and the woman who is just as bad as them both she helped them and participated in the sick scandal meaning Jeffrey Epstein's girl or whatever she wants to him she just a big player as the rest / ['what is the significance of adrenaline,  or pizza?']
40:35 😂😂😂 / ['“YES! 😂😂” \nEvil af…. God knows all and has seen all. Repent or good luck Andrew']

That girl who is accusing him is imo a liar. She's suckered alot of ppl. She wasn't brainwashed she wasn't intimidated..she kept going back time a d time again whereas if she was truly scared she would reported him ASAP. She was enjoying the high life and was gladly giving it up to these men. Fast forward till now,  it's about money not helping others.i bet she keeps all that settlement and does not put one dime  into safe houses and towards trafficked girls. She had every chance to run but went back again and again. / ["She actually gave a proportion to charity. How do you know the girls weren't brainwashed? As a fact, many were threatened that if they left, their families and themselves were in danger. And, you watching this interview must be the only person on this site who thinks Paedo Prince is innocent. Are you stupid????", "@helenmenzies1819 Hes a pedo theres no question. Both are at fault. DO YOUR HOMEWORK SHE GOT A SETTLEMENT out of it. One has opportunity for gain...Her. If she was told her family would be hurt dont you think her pic with him would show a less smiling face...perhaps a face of worry?? I think before you call people stupid you should think before you run your chops. You're exactly what that opportunist wanted you to believe. Are you an idiot?????"]
Liar / []
Sttttuter / []
The Queen Favourite son and the most corrupt one in the family, sometimes its hard to see the monster some kids turn into. / []
Oh big deal, the guy likes to fuck women as young as his daughter, who doesn’t? she was above the age of 18, she wouldn’t have been allowed in the nightclub Tramp otherwise, as she said that’s where she met him, anyway she took the payout, which as far as I’m concerned makes her a 14million pounds call girl and slut. / []
Bumbling fool 🙄 / []
He’s guilty all that stuttering. Face of evil. / []
My 1st time watching this.  He's a monster. The non sweating, is that even possible?  He HAD to see Epstein to end their friendship??  For four days!!  Pray Charles throws him out of mini palace.  He showed no remorse for what those poor girls endured. Awesome interview. / []
How funny the prince not only went to Epstein’s pervert townhouse to say “he can’t hangout anymore”, but then spends the night? Fully grown adults don’t spend the night. SMH. / []
Got me thinking, "where is the many photos that would have been taken of Andrew in that Night Club". / []
I'm not driving around the corner to end a friendship let alone fly across the country to end a friendship. / ['Across the ocean lol', '@8647LasVegas 🤣🤣']
41:05 (about) sounded like a Kamala Harris reply. “ I’m doing what I’m doing I order to carry out what I’m doing.” / []
He is a fuckin liar!!! Bodylanguage says it all. / []
it looks like he loose his memory. He says" I dont remember...I dont remember...I dont remember.." / []
You don't pay someone off if your innocent / []
This is painful to watch!!! He’s a horrible liar / []
British comedy, absolutely brilliant 🤣 / ['.yeah, the entertainment industry is in on it too, so I gather']
When he said "it was a convenient place to stay" my jaw dropped. This man can stay anywhere in the world that is more convenient than a convicted sex offender's house... The fact he knowingly chose to do so is repugnant. / ["That's the word- repugnant!", 'he is a sex offender and pedophile himself.', 'Right??? At BEST it shows incredibly bad judgment and complete disregard for the victims. And that is putting it kindly.', '@cindakeirsey9555 I could not agree more!', 'What a sick response and it shows what a cheap creep and privileged  moron he is!! I guess he expects freebies wherever he flops his lazy ass!!']
@11:49 he looked evil and sinister! / []
In the end, this man still was not held to account for his actions.  Most of us do not own fancy Swiss chateaus that we can sell to buy our way out of our crimes.  The entire episode reeks of privilege.  Andrew should have been prosecuted and imprisoned, but his class entitlements saved his ass. / []
🤣😁😁😁 / []
Oh well the Queen was good at covering up everything and yet Prince Harry was punished for marrying a coloured girl and moving away / []
And poor Harry is a spare 😘😘😘😘 / []
Ghosts inside / []
Everybody can see the lies coming out of his mouth / []
dirty old man / []
This interview is borderline laughable ‘or I didn’t sweat at the time’ absolute joke / []
"It was a convenient place to stay." / ['He’s basically saying “you caught me red handed and I’m not admitting it so here’s my bogus answer”']
Ugh why does he still have his title?? / []
Dirty pedo / []
PERVERT / []
this is like a car accident...its hard to watch but i cant look away / []
What can you say every country has there dirty laundry. “It was a convenient place to stay” this guy is ruthless. Suppose he was getting all the foot massage’s under the sun. / []
omg .. he is a war-hero that never sweats as well!! / []
i broke up with him, but then slept over one more time, for good ol’ times sake .. / []
epstein taught him ‘business’ and he taught the girls ‘biology’ / []

The queens favorite SLUG! 🤣🤣🤣 / []
He's a sex offender. He's been enabled his entire life by "yes men" around him. It only shows how corrupt the entire royal family really are.. / []
Price Andrews body language and facial expressions suggest to me that he us lying 🤥 / []
Does he get a Youtube plaque for reaching over a million views? / []
HOT MESS!!! / []
If this man's mum wasn't the Queen he would be behind bars now. He just withdraws from public life, allowed mummy to buy the silence of his accuser & continues his life insulated from the consequences of his actions. Sickening, disgusting man is clearly being deceptive here. / []
The BBC  NEVER ALLOWS COMMENTS    on its stories about royals. I challenge readers to find me incorrect` He and the rest  are parasites / []
He didn't sweat, WOW / []
This aged like milk, what a creep. It just shows that the elite and extremely wealthy are untouchable, they aren't on the same playing field as any of us it's sickening.... / []
Time to bring him down all hidden like the crimes of the Catholic church / []
So it wasn't only royalty get'n a bit of teenager sex on the side but also, politicians, UN members, big business leaders and other high rankers...peados all....GUILTY +++++ +..... / []

Hang out with Harvey it be better than a royal demotion and that they were never yours then now / []

How is he still left uncharged / []
"I have no recollection of ever taking that picture, but it was taken upstairs" / []
is that the "royal we" andrew ? narcissistic, despicable, idiotic,  buffoon.  This interview andrew is AN EPIC FAIL.  praise for emily maitlis the interviewer who did an excellent job. / []
vile man / []
Royal family are exempt from the law's / []
Andrew is innocent.Boris Johnson never attended a birthday party at his house and if he did no rules were broken and if they were he was unaware of the rules that he had made. BIll Clinton never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinnski and there was no whitewash at the white House and I've never taken drugs / []
He's just being economical with the truth and suffering from lapses of memory / ["I'm carrying on with what I do sponging off the population playing golf getting fat and kiddy fiddling", 'You forgot to mention making an error of judgement 😅']
A pervert. / []
How many believe , If he had the opportunity to do it , He would not take it ? / []
The Royal Family must keep tabs for security purposes the exact whereabouts of Prince Andrew every day of his life. They are covering up / []
Profusely sweating like a rapist 😏🤔 / []
He’s done a lot of things wrong but I don’t think he’s a pedio / ['I agree']
Randy Andy you sick animal 🤣😜 / []
So someone you don’t consider as a close friend goes to prison for sex with minors and you feel the need to go stay at his house on his release to tell him you can’t see him anymore,  seems legit / ['Maybe Prince Andrews mobile phone was disconnected at that time.  Because he hadn’t paid his bill?  That’s why he had to go over to the states instead😂😂😂😂😂😂']
Dont think I have seen a worse liar in my life lol. He is terrible at interviews. / []
definitely one of the best interviews in last 20 years / ['Lol', 'except for Andrew HA']
The an ultimate FREAK / []
Absolutely repugnant man!!! Money talks!! / []
I've heard how bad his interview was but I hadn't imagined it this bad... / []
HRH trapped at every turn by a very professional interrogator. / []
It’s like he’s a 25 year old former frat boy who never grew up / []
Hope to see Harry like this too. He is another Andrew case. / []
wtf / []
1st- being friends w Epstein 2nd mistake-having s** w minors 3rd mistake- having a photo w his underage victim 4th mistake- doing this interview. / []
The interviewer is a genius / []
My God, this man lies shamelessly with the certainty that no matter what happens, nothing very serious will happen to him. What indecency. / []
Why should the settlement come from the public.   Why not get it from his multi- millionaire brother the King.   He was a duchy for many decades earning $26+ million a year. / []
3:44 “in the naavy!!” 🎶🎵⛴🏴‍☠️🕺🏻💋💋😚🎵🎶 / []
So if I discover my friend I have known for decades is a criminal, should I go and visit, party with him/her then on final day take him/her for a stroll in the park to announce our friendship is over? Andrew, you are a bigger fool than you look. / []
Andy pinoccio / []
A disgrace of a man / []
I think this guy is lying. / []
Oh yeah, you leave the comments on for THIS video, but the ones where you come off like an ignorant and inciting, sensationalist witch hunter you can't bring yourself to let people express themselves.....weak / []
Rich people are protected. Eat the rich ! / []
"My tendency to be too honourable". This man is a sack of dirt. / []
Who in the hell is  "we"?!  Prince Andrew keeps saying "we don't know, we aren't sure"... He never takes responsibility for anything, and this interview makes my blood boil. / []
First time seeing this how shocking .. you can tell the lies from his body language and his eyes .. sicken 🤢 / ["Well, he contradicted himself the whole interview, even without  analyzing  his body language, you can tell he's lying"]
Unless you have something "burning hot" to hide you meet someone to tell them "I think is not appropriate that we remain in contact".  When you don't want to be in contact with someone you just stop contacting them !!!!  lol...unless there is something really filthy that will incriminate you and you need to make sure they will keep you out of the picture... / []
What a "dirty old man" 🤣 / []
Hip hip cheerio / []
On the second viewing you notice the little traps she sets for him and how he stumbles into them. E.g. he seems to admit the foot massage 10 minutes after vehemently denying that it ever happened when he is distracted by a question with a different thrust.  What is interesting is why he chose to defend himself in this particular way. He could have said that as a famous person people often ask him to photograph themselves with him and he assumes that the background of the photo could have been just that but he does not  specifically recall it being taken or the identity of the person with him in the photo.  Why did he choose to insinuate that the photo was a fake? The position of his hand is not all that incriminating or suggestive so why does he say its not his hand?  Why did he choose to say that he went Epstein's house to break up with him rather than to challenge him with regards to his conviction which as a friend would justifiably (perhaps) seem perplexing. He could have said that he found it hard to believe at first and wasn't emotionally ready to break up immediately or believe the story. / []
he wont say the girls name ...! / []
who's watching this interview in 2022 ? :) / []
This is my first time watching this interview in it’s entirety. THIS IS PAINFUL TO WATCH! Absolutely painful! It’s awkward and makes me sick to my stomach. I’d love to see a body language expert critique this interview. Well done to this journalist. WELL DONE! / ['@Chaps wow, thank you for that. That was very very interesting!', 'The behavior panel did it.', 'Krissy there is a body language expert done it', 'Squirmitus', 'https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HC40bgA2wKA']
This is the true definition of a narcissist  He makes my skin crawl / []
Andrew was in Kubricks last movie... / ['i dont care']
Apparently this didn’t age well. He didn’t do it , and the women lied . / []
Honorable!!??  He’s making excuses a child could see through. What a jackass / []
I dunno hey, I kind of believe him, sure I would let him babysit my kids. / []
Wtf he never answered anything / []
Surely the reason why he couldn’t be associated with him any more didn’t need explaining never mind a personal visit or convenient stay over!  having said that should be enough however  had he not settled I think I might have believed much of what he says here perhaps he’s just too gullible and not the brightest button on the planet ~never mind the most honorable .. but then again the fact that he repeats he has no recollection over and over again rather than point blank denying it could possibly be him is … just … so … weird, I question more his mental state than whether he is lying or not .. just all in all incredibly unsophisticated attempts at clearing himself or lying or telling the truth so I do find it very sad. / []
When someone reminded me about Pizza Hut in Woking I was like “ oh yes I remember that” 😂😂😂. I also didn’t sweat at the time so I’m afraid to say the medical condition would make it impossible for it to happen. Please say more 😂 / ['pizza and adrenaline..']
This hasn't aged well or got any better for Andy / []
He keeps saying that he couldn't be SEEN with him.  I think that's exactly to conversation.  We'll be friends but we can't be seen together until this blows over. / []
The only way this could be even better is if it was a split-screen with the other half showing the PR team/spokespersons of the Palace watching the interview real-time without their knowing. I mean large parts of this conversation could make an exceptionally good skit. It just shows that this man has not once been stood up to in his life. / []
What worries me is that these RICH & POWERFUL PEOPLE are Still out THERE,,,, And these poor  Girls are being lead ASTRAY by people like GHISLAINE MAXWELL,,, KARMA is Coming for ALL of YOU INVOLED / []
He’s tripping on his tongue.  As my granny would say……”liar, liar, pants on fire” / []
Don’t know about you lot but I always have a chuckle at the apparent suicide of my dead friend… 38:23 40:36 / []
"How do you explain that? I can't." All is said and done. / []
“It was a convenient place to stay”, pretty much sums up royalty nowadays tbh / []
such a weasel. / []
Side note: Emily is SOOOOO beautiful. / []
Ohhh that’s ridiculous this man is full of crap honestly full of crap . / []
Just young girls absolute full of rubbish this man is / []
He don’t go into a friendship looking for the wrong thing ?  But maybe you should make sure they are checked over you are a public royal figure so that would always be checked out wouldn’t it be ? / []
Too much coincidence, and if it was all made up lies they would rip the girl to smithereens, but it's true, obviously, he's a weasel for want of many more nastier words, a disgraceful being from a disgraceful family, / []
His tie is as crooked as he is / []
I support the The Duke & Duchess of York in their many endeavors to make the world a better place to live.  To Your Royal Highnesses The Prince & Princess Andrew The Duke & Duchess of York keep your heads up, and stay positive, and optimistic.  You have done nothing wrong. / []
Not very many people new what Epstein was about.  The Prince had no idea what Epstein was doing.  I wish people would leave the The Duke of  York alone.  The Prince was an innocent bystander. / ['😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\nGood one..']
"Passing in the passage" he said, He admitted it right there, that means 2 at the same time, / []

11:44 that was painful to watch… he was called out on his lie and did a terrible job trying to save face. This interview was disastrous. I can’t believe he wanted to do this. Great job to the interviewer tho! She called him out on his BS without seeming too aggressive which would’ve prob made him shut down the interview. It’s good that she let him talk himself into a mess / ['I always felt that he may have been encouraged to do the interview by those who wanted him to get a beating?', 'You mean "talk himself into..." the soft & pungent, right up to his neck, what?', "It's shocking that he's not been held accountable for his evil actions. I've never seen someone so obviously lying in all my life.", "he didn't want to do it, he did mention pizza and adrenaline, which had some significance to these circles"]
I'm now watching this car crash of an interview. What bothers me about this whole interview - is that Randy Andy never says just this "I would never have sex with an underage girl. Not my thing, as a father to two little girls, I could never, ever have sex with a minor, or anyone being sexually trafficked. The very idea of that is absolutely repugnant to me. Never."  "I know who all of my sexual partners have been, and I have never, would never engage in that behaviour with a trafficked female, minor or otherwise."  Randy Andy is a terrible liar. It doesn't even sound like HE believes what he is saying. Pathetic. Whoever advised Royal Randy Andy to do this interview greatly erred in their judgement. / ['He says stuff like "I don\'t recall" because he wants to keep the option to change his story later. Weasel language.']
It makes me sick to know that the elite get away with crimes that  ordinary people would go to prison for. It's not right, but they get away with it.  One day I hope it changes. / []
Lier / []
“Extraordinary people” what? Clients to trafficked girls? / []
'straight forward shooting weekend'.. I wanna know what humans they were shooting 🤔 / []
What a liar. / []
Hanging his hat on it was just through a friendship with Ghislaine. He was done for when she was locked up. / []
People expect too much from the royal family and there are people who can be cunning to lure them in. It was so with Queen Mary (Scotland). She was a victim in some ways but God used King James for the book.  God forgives us all according to the Bible.  Long live the kings and queens and that of United Kingdoms. / ['You Religious Nut!!! Imagine if someone in your family was sexually abused! Crawl back in your hole you DESPICABLE DISGRACE OF A HUMAN!!!']
One of Epstein's regular clients. / []
liar / []

Well if you never went upstairs as you said  how did you know it was upstairs that the photo was taken / []
He really needs to sack his advisors lol!! / []
Really hard to watch..can't lie to save his life! / []
Guess it’s easy to disown a homie when he’s dead and they all doing it lmao kinda like Jacksonville rappers / []
in the course of history many kings, princes etc have had sex with children. Why would this guy break tradition? What's at risk for him? A pay cut? / []
Creeeeeeeep / []
cant stand Andy &  this interview is so car crash  but that photo looks so shopped, look at the outline of his trousers, looks like it was done on paint. also her hand just isnt resting on her leg its hanging in midair just a really weird photograph / []
This man is the worst f***n liar, he can't even pretend his way out of this! / []
So Mi6 or the British intelligence services did not investigate associates of a Prince of the Realm, whom may endanger or jeopardise the safety of the Prince or the interests of the nation, whom regularly (up to 3 times a year according to Andy Pandy) had face time and socialised with both Epstein and Maxwell, did not even know that a police warrant had been issued for Epstein before being invited to a Royal event. It’s really not difficult to find out if an arrest warrant had been issued for ANYONE let alone guests of the Royal Family and indeed keeping up to date background checks on ANYONE that will have any interaction with the Royal Family is one of the first things to be prioritised by intelligence services. The interviewer conveniently didn’t ask about any of those anomalies. It also can’t be asked about in Parliament. The BBC is complicit in this too by failing to ask certain questions. Absolutely disgraceful and an insult to the nation. Oh and I’m only about 8 minutes in. Can’t wait to hear the tripe of how he justifies actually staying as a guest at Epstein’s house, after Epstein had already been convicted. / []
You can’t say you can’t remember and then say it never happened. Those two concepts are contradictory. / []
She was 17 so above slightly above legal age of consent. So why couldn't he of admitted it? It was distasteful, but he didn't commit child abuse. I don't understand fully why he lied. Legal age of consent is 16. / ['Because he’s an ‘honorable’ gentleman']
It's never been more obvious that someone is lying....sickening! / []
LIAR! full stop Your Majesty! / []
0:01 Andrew’s face. -I’m gonna nail this. 😊 / []
2:30: this man lives in an alternate reality. He never partied? The evidence is there… pictures, newspapers, witness accounts… the fact that he thinks his word is worth more than hard evidence is pathetic. / []
For anyone that is trained in how to spot signs of lying. This is a paradise. In fact, anyone can probably spot the crap coming out of his mouth here / []
He blinks when he lies / []
My goodness / []
He SHOULD be in jail. / []
Blink, blink blink. Liar, liar, LIAR / []
He knows NOTHING / []
As a so called ex serviceman, he can’t even wear his tie straight. Fibs fibs and utter lies / []
The “The Crown” episode we all want to see but will never get. / []
Watching this is a complete waste of precious life time! You know, I know, everybody knows it's complete bullshit and he only could save him from jail bc of loads of money... / []
They aren’t good friends AT ALL, yet he felt like it was necessary and honourable (because he is TOO honourable) for him to travel to the US and meet with his “casual friend” face to face for 4 days to tell him that they can’t be friends anymore. 🤦‍♂️ / []
THIS GUY IS A PSYCHOPATHIC LIAR. ANOTHER DISGRACE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY / []
The X HRH is nothing more then a sex pest. Bullshit is what everyone is expected to believe. All his done is shown all sex offenders that money Can keep you of the sex offenders register. IF by chance, were so stupid to believe all this crap then why didn't he fight the claims in court. He used mummy's money to get himself out of the shit. Tax payers money. Dirty good for nothing C*** / []

And THAT IDIOT IS related to Henry the fooking 8th !! / ["Well they're both womanizers, guess they have something in common lol"]

So much I could say about this interview, but one word will do... GUILTY! Especially after seeing him just stick his fingers in his own daughters arse crack in front of the world! / []
Wait, the man had a teenage daughter and was friends with a convicted sex offender yet felt the need to go stay at his home to tell him in person they couldn’t be friends or be seen together again?! I don’t know a father alive that could even be in the same room of a convicted freaking monster!!!! He sounds like a total liar, you can even hear him swallowing loudly. Why on earth did he do this interview, how entitled has this guy been all his life he felt it was a good idea to even talk about this horrific situation?! This is just sad. / []
Who Advised this idiot to do an interview with one of the most deceitful and coŕupt media organisations on this planet  The woke BBC  or as it is now called, Noah's Ark because just about every tv show they put out Has to have two of everything in it Take a BBC period drama for starters  2 Gay's 2 lesbians  2 Muslims  2 Pakistani  2 Indians  2 African's  2 non binary  2 Transvestites  2 transgenders  0 whites,we don't want them spoiling a good shit show BBC, needs to be disbanded and Flushed down the toilet 💩💩💩💩 Along with the perverts who run it / []
She was a prostitute receiving money from him. Why complaint now about their business. He should be just not even having this interview. He is not good in lying. It just shows that spoiled royal family's true dark side. / []
He is so full of shit in this interview. They didn’t call him “Randy Andy” for nothing.  Tendency to be too honorable??  Is he kidding with that? How do you stay at someone’s home and not know what is going on??? / []
Repulsive he is to this day. / []
I like how employees of epstein said they saw him with girls at the island... yet he denies everything... amazing also how he cant explain the photo...LOL.. "can't explain.. deal with it but i am 100% innocent" / []
The Behavior Panel on YouTube does a two part analysis of this interview, it is a great watch. / []
Hilarious....such a loser / []
Why does he purposely cough when he says I would have to do what my advisor says...SMH all this is scripted for him to say. / []
I cannot understand why he would be his mother’s favorite child… cann anybody explain? Or is it just an invention of tabloids based on nothing? I mean, in this interview, he really behaves and answers the questions in a very idiotic way, just like a spoiled child would, thinking that everybody would believe his nonsense answers as if everyone was his mum willing to forgive and bless whatever he does. I cannot believe that HM the Queen, who was so concerned about her role, would have Andrew as favourite son. He just seems frustrated to be the “spare”, not having the same public attention as his brother Charles and his children get, compensating that by behaving in such an obnoxious manner. / []
Honestly Andrew you buried yourself the best thing for prince Andrew is to shut up / []
I’ve watch this so many times and I still can’t believe a word he says. Also, the interviewer deserves an award. She was respectful, asked straight forward questions, and allowed him to answer the questions without being interrupted. / ['I need this woman’s autograph', "Her face at the start is priceless. She knew she was going to eat him alive before he'd even begun speaking. 🤣", '@lindz9341 she went light on him', 'Hang on... how old was she supposed to be plz?', 'Has she not been proven to be a liar?']
From Russia with love....🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶 / []
Now if Piers Morgan had this interview with Prince Andrew....... / []
Stevie Wonder just watched this and can see he's lying through his teeth 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 / []
Royally guilty.  P.O.S. / []
Why was it honorable and the right thing to do at the time?  He broke off the friendship because he didn't want to caught.  Shameful / []
Impossible to believe a word he utters. He sounds like a child making it up as he goes. / []
the royals told him to clear his name so that there’s no damage to their wealth and reputation and look at him talking nonsense lol no confidence or truth at all / []
Hes a liar plain to see. "I had to see him in person to tell him we cant be friends anymore"....bullshit. The interviewer tore him apart, expertly. / []

THIS MAN NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUBTABLE FOR HIS DEEDS.  HE IS A SPOILED BRAT / []
Positive action is hilarious 😂 4 times a yeeeeaaar. This is the interview that keeps on giving. / []
Apparently after the interview ended and he was walking her out, he thought it’d gone amazingly so he said, “maybe next time we can do something about the work I’m doing. This has been so much fun!” 🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
Why is the UK media not talking about this and trashing the Duchess of Sussex every day. / []
I bet he was sweating throughout the interview... / []
Maxwell has just about 9 more months to reduce her TWENTY YEAR sentence by giving up some of these child rapists. Is she really going to spend decades in prison, to protect these men???? / []
Even if we don't see this man face the repercussions of his actions in his lifetime, I hope to God that the world will never forget him to be the sick and disgusting pedophile he was before loving him for his royal connections.  And I also hope the world will never forget how much this truly exposed the abuse of power by the royal family as it shows that they'd do literally anything to protect their image. / []
He's quilty as sin. AFTER HE WAS CONVICTED, HE STILL VISITED THE PERVERT. / []
"He had the extraordinary ability to bring people together." - Yeah, he was super rich.....funny how that works. / []
You ever hear a criminal defense attorney say "NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE"!!!!! The same applies to TV presenters when you are in legal trouble. / []
Whoever advised him to do this interview is an IDIOT! I bet it was some PR moron. Any lawyer - civil or criminal - would have told him to keep his mouth shut. / []
I would have more respect for him if he just admitted it.  This interview is insane !!! / ['..just admit it and get lots of people more powerful than him in trouble?\nThey sent him here for some reason']
Simpler just to say, yes I shagged her. She was overage and she consented. / []
How she managed not to stand up and puke all over him, I’ll never know. / []
He flew 3500 miles and took a walk in a very public park, to tell someone he could no longer have contact with him!🤔🙄😒 Is it hilarious or just pathetic that he actually thinks people will believe that??? 😆😅😂🤣 / []
All the eye blinking and stuttering… dead give away / []
vile lying creature / []

I feel such deep empathy for all the people involved in Epstein's world, the poor girls who were violated, the people like Andrew who wanted to know and be a part of the movers and shakers of the world. Epstein knew and associated with very powerful business people.  Andrew has told you with his own words, he wanted to be a part of that.  Epstein and his girlfriend used Andrew's status, and all of those other celebrities' , and the young girls,  for their own personal gratification. Andrew being the fourth wheel in a really big cog probably wanted to be a part of this high powered financial status group to demonstrate his own worth as a savvy businessman with connections to the Firm. Birds of a feather do not always flock together for same reasons.  When I found out that this photo was a photo of a photo, it is also plausible that Epstein planned on blackmailing Andrew at some point. I feel so sorry for everyone Epstein involved in his sick games, most of all the young and naïve girls, and yes,  I also feel sorry for Andrew, he was played, and in a very public way.  Until this interview I had already pre-judged Andrew as I had heard rumors from disgruntled staff, but I think Andrew was being as straightforward as he legally could in this interview, he just had too much to lose otherwise. I expected him to be evasive at every question, but he answered as much as he could legally.  I waited a long time to see this interview and I am glad I saw it, and everyone can pass judgement on all the people involved, but I still have doubt about the extent of Andrew's involvement.  So, let us just deal solely with what facts we do have.  One picture...... What did the picture show anyway?  A sex act, NO just someone with their arm around someone else.  This photo does not imply a sexual encounter, what it shows exactly is a "one time meeting" of two people who may not have ever seen each other again. This photo does not for me, prove anything other than Andrew may have actually met the plaintiff at an Epstein gathering and nothing more. It would be easy to forget someone at a one time meeting.  Yet, from this one photo depicting nothing other than a one time friendly encounter, two lives and the lives of all their family members are completely and utterly destroyed.    How sad for all the people Epstein and his girlfriend involved in their exploits. Epstein and his girlfriend wasted their lives, but Andrew and these poor manipulated girls have another chance to show the world these events will not define them.  I hope all the girls are all able to find a way to raise above what happened to them, and I hope that Andrew will raise above this speculation and show the world what he is truly capable of being.  So far, what has he accomplished other than this choice to affiliate with a former classmate and Jeffry Epstein which was truly an exercise in bad judgement of a person's character, he has raised two beautiful and productive daughters, been a loving son, and served in the military with honor. Andrew can be redeemed, and he can do better with the rest of his life, "if" the world and the "Firm" will let him.  If I were a jury member, I could not convict Andrew solely on this one photo, nor his testimony of events.....  BUT what is Andrew really guilty of then?  We may never know the whole truth and nothing but the truth of the matter regarding the Plaintiff, Jeffry Epstein, his girlfriend, and Prince Andrew, but in the court of public opinion for sure Andrew is guilty of very bad judgement and naivety in his loyalty to undeserving friends and/or classmates, a total lack of understanding of empathy for those poor girls, and his burning desire to demonstrate to the Firm he was a mover and a shaker in the business world which led to seeking out truly undesirable classmates and associates. Andrew, I say move on and do not let this define who you are.  This is the past, go forward.  Raise above it, find a purpose to serve your family and country as you have demonstrated you are truly capable of. This could truly be a turning point for the good in your life. You could use your highly visible position to form non-profits to aid and assist young woman and men who are less fortunate than you are. In your book of life,  write on the last pages of your book of life with your good deeds for others. / ['It’s not what he said that made he seem guilty but what he doesn’t say.

How much is he paying you?', '@helenmenzies1819 First of all I am not for sale! I feel misunderstood bc I completely believed he is guilty even before the interview.

Pretty much thinking that Andrew - was well aware of his dates.  Easy sex. He was provided the easy sex via Epstein. Many of those ' dates '  - have not come forward.  It is sad but  true. / []
It’s not fair to say that he’s lying constantly only when his lips move / []
Every time he stutters or makes those shocked facial expressions is just a stall tactic to buy more time to come up with an answer / []
BODY LANGUAGE EXPERTS MUST BE HAVING A FIELD DAY WITH ANDREW / []
Andrew soudiar on people are cockroaches I have been bullied since I was 16 am now 61 you are who you are people are cockroaches bless you / []
Omg, He saying  he doesn’t remember  meeting the girl is  come on Andrew is known for chasing women.He’s stuttering between answers so you know he’s definitely lying / []
I’m sorry but Andrew is so full of shit, he said he distanced himself from Epstein when he was first incarcerated but then when Epstein was released he said he went to New York & explain & stop the friendship in person it doesn’t make sense bc im sure Epstein  knew it was over when Andrew distanced himself & yet Andrew stayed  at Epstein’s a few days after he ended the friendship , who does that. When you end  a friendship that’s it you leave you don’t stay a week / []
Hilarious!! Listen to the stuttering... look at the squirming... / []
Funny how everyone else is wrong in their assertions. / []
I don't know why he would of done this interview because everything about it just portrays lies. Why would so many individual women accuse him, that is the question because if 3 or more people accused someone of the same thing wouldn't that say your guilty. "that picture was took upstairs" wow what a shot in the foot lol all his clusters are easy to spot, hes totally lying but why would he admit it without concrete evidence, his position and where the crimes took place protect him even if he did lose all his royal accolades. If he was found guilty there is no coming back and he knows it just like epstein. He reminds me of a cunning snake, just slithers in and out of the cracks without being caught. / []
It's time for a new Cromwell. Fortunately, Charles III is old so the head will snap off quickly. / []
If he had not done this interview, I don't think he would've lost all he has lost. / ["He's lost NOTHING.", 'he probably got rewarded']
My favorite interview of all time . His animated face is priceless.  He's a clown 🤡." I had to go see him"  Why, did you have to go see him ? I do not sweat 🤣 / []
And he is vile to Camilla! What a piece of work he is.  Tidy up your own teddy bears and try not to run over plebs in your range rover. Thick as mince doesn't begin to describe him. / []

OMG! He is a spoiled child at 45+. What a disgusting  self-important person he believes he is. / []
Hi Andrew, we never met each other. Can I have $15m of mummy’s money please? / []
There is a group of body language experts that have covered this interview, Prince Pervert here should do some time and WHERE IS THE LIST OF THE OTHERS? / []
What can I say for the royal family and their circles. One is best mates with saville (even ask his opinion about marriage and other things) and the other with Epstein.   A man who could afford to stay to any royal suit of the poshest hotel, decides to "save" money and stay at his friends house.   Or he flew (with money that us taxpayers) to stay to his house to tell him it's over rather than a simple phone call or even better ignore or if he wanted to go to do it face to face to stay in a hotel and meet at the park and leave.   If you strip the titles and money, the whole bunch are a very rubbish and poor quality of a family. From extra marital affairs or cover ups etc.    Good job on the interview.. / []
What about the picture Andrew ? Lmao another entitled prick / []
Sad, you can tell he’s lying. What a big fat liar. He’s a disgrace / []
LIAR! / []
he is stammering all the time and the answers he gave were way out of line and he was most of the time very defensive....sad / []
Virginia is not the victim here.  She knew dang well what she was doing, and she loved every minute of it. / []
Here to read funny comments.  🤣🤣. It's says enough! / []
Wow he said his biggest fault is “tending to be too honorable” which translates to he is a depraved sexual deviant. / []
Come on Andrew you are not stupid so stop acting as if you did not know. It is bad enough that  you visited this paedophile but to appear on TV and try to lie your way out of it / []
I love coming back and watching this again, I can’t get enough because he has to be the WORST liar I’ve ever seen.  OMG🤣 and the story how he can’t sweat😂 / ['Bet he,d sweat if he got 25yrs in the USA👌', '\u200b@maggie_n_mitchMost definitely!!!', '..because of an overdose of adrenaline? or adrenochrome?']
What did this guy learn from Epstein, let me guess !! How to get foot massage from young girls ? He is soo guilty and a full of BS !!!! Suddenly he can’t remember any thing , a claim of dementia and denial of his reckless shameful behaviour. Do a lie detector , will proof everything we need to know which is so obvious anyway s / []
He was led astray by Mr Dick Epstein! / []
It was a convenient place to stay. Lol. At the home of a convicted sex offender. What a low life piece of shiiiiiat. With young girls coming and going, wow. This guy is a disgrace beyond disgrace.  This had to age the already aging queen and add to her stresses to point of, well, she's dead so there. Him, Harry, Brexit- all tore the Queen down health wise I believe. Andrew and Harry the whiner should be so ashamed of themselves. / ["Harry didn't do anything wrong. He chose to leave the royal family because of how the media was treating his wife and children.\n If that stressed the queen out so bad, then she sounds super controlling"]
Great interviewer!! She would not let up and he is So Squirmish!! His mouth gets so dry, he has to keep licking his lips because he’s so nervous and getting So Flustered…. What a lying snake 🐍  “I don’t have a message for her” he says. Wouldn’t your question be “WHY are you doing this to me??”  If he was innocent?? “4 times??!!” He says in a high voice about getting massages… that he says he DIDNT GET?!! He’s probably thinking I got more like 40…. He’s disgusting…. JUST BE HONEST “PRINCE” ANDREW.😡🤬🙄🙄🙄 / []
We've all "worked together" to accept that you Sir, are completely full of shit. / []
This guy is is a terrible liar. / []
I am dumbfounded by his audacity and ignorance. purposeful ignorance. I feel so bad for the victims. and the royal family because it's humiliating to be seen as guilty by association . He tarnished the reputation of his entire family. He tarnished the crown itself. / []
Such a fool, immature with little ability at critical decision making. He's in the wrong line of work. A disgrace to the Royal family. The poor Queen had to endure this garbage. / []
He is just full of shit, guilt all over his face.. / []
Come on, it was convenient? You’re a prince you can afford to stay anywhere you want / []
HE WENT FROM I ONLY REALLY KNEW GHISLAIN TO AT THE END WE ALL KNEW HIM!!!???? WTF!!!.??? / []
strange family / []
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER....HES CONVINCED HIMSELF HE DOESN'T KNOW HER. / []
THIS WAS ALL STAGED TO MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD BUT AS IT GOES ON HE LOOKS WORSE AND WORSE. / []
ALL HAIL THE RICH PERV HAS SPOKEN!!!??? / []
Convenient place to stay ? I bet it was a train station . Was it a free ride he had / []
He didn't half make a cock of himself / []
He looked completely rattled from the start of the interview. You don't need to be a body language expert to see he's lying and who the fuck let's you use their house if you're not close friends ffs / []
this guy belongs in jail. however mama came to the rescue. / []
No body believe  you in that interview  I remember watching / []
Most of these comments are from people who are on an evil witch hunt. / []
“Since his suicide” he knows he alive! / []
Just want to say - one can feel where the dishonesty is spoken - this is hateful & revolting - The Firm  directing what to reveal?  Apologies Andrew -  you are a bad liar 🌏- btw - honesty is a healthy thing - to yourself if nothing else. Congratulations to thé interviewer - very well and sensitively handled. 🌏 / []
Was Prince Andrew  asked about meeting Megan on the large boat of Epstiens where Andrew meeting Megan were getting close........ / []
"There was certainly no party", a year later other people are saying that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Maitlis does not believe a word Prince Andrew is saying. She's leading with questions and insinuating that he's guilty.  Shes the same in all interviews where she's right, they are wrong. Shocking woman / []

I get it but I feel like it was an album stuck on a scratch just repeating the same words over and over and over again ! I mean clearly you can tell he’s lying but at least reword it a little 🤦🏽‍♀️ I wish he was wearing a dog zap collar activated by lying 💥💪🏽 / []
Thats why the Queen Mother didn't get to live her complete lifespan. This dude can lie better than hunter biden. The headshake reveals his deniable denial.  Oh, the tears are worth a chuckle. / []

I've never been on a straightforward shooting weekend. Wonder what that's like.... / []
He’s like the pages of a book and they all have guilt written all over them… / []

International play boy without a vertebrae. / []
I went to stay a few days with a sex offender to tell him I don't want to see him again....... makes sense 🤔 / ['Perhaps get one last happy ending']
You can tell he is not being truthful. When his family doesn’t believe him we should we? / []
Theirs things that I and a lot of people do that we don't remember, normally it's when we are fuddled, eg intoxicated and confused. He must have taken some seriously strong drugs. No excuse. / []
THE LUNATICS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE WORLD, OUR KIDS ARE BEING MOLESTED BY THE POWERFUL AND RICH. SO WHAT'S ARE THE SAIN GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. NOTHING / []
Why does he go into the issue about sweating, IF HE WASN'T THERE. 35 years of studying human behaviour, namely psychology and his trying to blink purposely to cover his lies. He is  good at covering his lies. But the truth shines through his deceptions. Listening to his voice and watching his eyes, is very interesting to me. I know that he's trying to save his reputation. I feel sorry for him because he seems like a good family guy. I would love to hear from Beatrice's mouth, her point of view. She is obviously aware that he is doing something wrong. I known that, because she isn't hasn't tried to back his stories. Any partner who is involved in such attrosities, would support publicly their partner, if this was a scandal. She's going to keep her mouth shut, because she doesn't want to go down in history as married to a monster. / ["It's not Beatrice it's Sarah Ferguson! And she had an affair whilst with Andy Pandy and was caught by a newspaper trying to sell access to him for £500,000. Nobody is interested in what she has to say, she's a CRETIN!"]
I am not going to see him again. Attends dinner party days later  WHET? (yes I meant to spell it incorrectly)  He would  be better served confessing to being secret lovers at this point, really / []
The only, ONLY reason he went in person, as a face to face had nothing to do with honor 9:21. It was to make sure he (a) wasn't going to blackmail him (b) discussed what could possibly be utilized as blackmail or (c) negotiated how much (money, favors, power exchanges) to retrieve incriminating evidence Epstein on him to clean his slate.  That is it and that is all thus affirming his guilt. Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. / []
The level of absolute lying and responsibility dodging here is truly, truly amazing. Mummy!!!! Mummy!! welp atleast she doesn't need to deal with this child's bs anymore 🙄. Can you imagine the level of whinging from him over his entire life? Sickening and mind blowing / []
First time seeing this . Wow . She nailed his ass to the wall . This is truly amazing . Why is this man not band from everything 😂 / []
I have watched this interview 30 times - it is a masterpiece. It is almost 2023 - and here I am again.....never gets old. Update: Almost 2024 (Nov'23) this still makes me laugh - he is atrocious. / ['My thoughts exactly', 'Lol same here 😅 September 5,2022.', '@elvirastokes1335 Same here but October 7th 2022. I think you are a month out if you made your comment 2 days ago!!', "I watch it every few months and as you say, it never gets old! And I still find myself asking the same question every time... what on EARTH was he thinking agreeing to this? It's as insane as it is disgusting", 'Same..classic 🤣']
She is phenomenal!! She isn't falling for his BS  - his facial expressions called -out about the dinner and Russian foot massage. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAH - PRICELESS. / []
this lady Virginia is lies the lady who interviewed prince Andrew keeps repeating herself thinking that prince Andrew might sleep up .she gust getting prince Andrew into trouble .the picture of Andrew is fake with her. she tell the truth. / ['Are you a Robot.']
FULL OF SHIT YOU ARE ANDREW !! / []
Why would he even do the interview? / []
He said “he didn’t sweat at the time” 🤣🤣🤣 he’s what I like to call a “man child” / []
The only way this could have been better was if Chris Hansen was there to greet Andy when he walked in and asked him to " Take a seat " / ['Omg yes!']
Nothing he said is truthful. It’s extremely obvious that his words are so hollow / []
Tendency to be too honorable. I’ll bet he actually believes himself. / []
A royal pedo / []
Why were you staying with a sex offender?  I went there to tell him I couldn't be seen with him. ..we went for a walk in the park..  You can make this up? Does Andrew take us all as fools?   Omg! It just gets worse! In 2010 it was a convenient place to stay with a sex offender / []
Too late BBC, we know what and who you are and what it is you do / ["No Sarcasm, I'm genuinely asking as an American? I have My own thoughts on BBC, but I'm always ready to be informed. Enlighten Me further about any Hidden in Plain Sight Bias or Agendas I have missed, Please?"]
Liar, liar, liar!!! / []
Now, I am a pacifist...but this interview with this squirming a-hole makes me want to be the interviewer, get up from my seat and SLAP him back to reality  - adding " NO NO NO NOOO It´s enough!" . No one would judge me.... / []
29:30 “AAAAHHHHHHH FUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK” 🎉 / []
Liar, liar.😅😅😅. Money money and he’ll never pay for his disgusting actions / []
She looks physically sick whilst looking at him. / []
Its just so embarassing / []
This is why Prince Andrew got the Queen's corgi's, because he is the most experienced groomer... When you turn 100 you got a letter from the Queen, when you turn 13 you get an invitation from Pedo Andrew. / []
Gone forever / []
I’m just surprised that the corrupt BBC were happy to take on the Royal family by airing this interview. / []
What a horrible interview. / []
I once heard it said that when someone is shaking their head while stating something, they don’t believe it.  Otherwise lying. / []
5.49-6.04. The hand gestures don’t even match the importance of the words he was saying. Nor did his tone. “I knew the things to look for”. That’s kind of the backhanded point the interviewer is getting at Prince Pedrew. You KNEW what was in front of you 🫵🏼🤮 And one more thing… whose disastrous (and exquisite) idea was it for him to do this interview? His answers have been written for him and he’s clearly been coached. Possibly by Epstein’s lawyers themselves. But he kind of malfunctions and the answers come out all defective. You had one job Pedrew! This is too uncomfortable to watch. Watching a ped maintain their innocence after the photographic imagery has beamed around the world. Humanity can’t get any lower than this. / []
His story is as crooked as his tie🤷🏻‍♀️ / []
This man is a full on liar / []
This man is SICK. Wouldn't let him anywhere near   my grandchildren. A NARCISSIST. Sheds no sweat!!!! DOCTORS certificate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
This video has 6.7 million views , and every single viewer knows fine rightly this man is guilty!!!! Yet because of who he is nothing will happen to him!.,........ What has happened to society?....r.i.p decency / []
How did he know the photo was taken up stairs??????? Said he'd never been upstairs / []
I don’t know for a fact but my instinct is that he is guilty as sin ( I also do not believe for one minute that Epstein committed suicide ), why else would you pay an alleged victim millions if you’re innocent ? Continuing polite contact with a convicted sex offender is inappropriate abhorrent and will NEVER end well, you’ll reap what you sow. On the same token why would an alleged victim accept monetary compensation instead of the perpetrator being in prison? The professionalism of the interviewer is outstanding. I hope ALL of Epstein’s accomplices are held to account, the innocent accused vindicated and the victims receive justice. This entire situation requires the most vigorous investigation and those found with no doubt guilty receive the most harsh punishment and the victims receive justice and the greatest support. / []
He makes no sense he states he wasn't so close to him but then he does a 3 days stay at this house to break up the friendship 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Doesn't he just sound lams AF / []
Why is he not in jail yet? / []
The hissing of the S is killing me.  Can't watch.  Oh an Andrew is so damn guilty. / []
Or late Queen was lovely!!! Her disgraceful son, brought disgrace to her. At least, Prince Andrew lost his title!!! / ['He will forever live with the shame he brought to his mother, father, and siblings because he showed no discernment in his friendships.']
Leave him alone / []
I’m actually on Richards side until there’s  actual DNA evidence he did anything or she takes a polygraph then I’ll change my mind / ['What about his multi-million dollar pay-off?', 'polygraphs are so useless.']
Delete monarchy support republic / []
was he put in jail? BS / []
This is like watching a comedy skit! lol / []
he thought it was the honourable thing to do to break up with his pedophile friend in person and stayed at his home for a few days because it was convenient and while people were coming and going he saw nothing = terrible liar / []
Everyone attacking Meghan when you all should be going after this nasty piece of excuse of human filth. / ["False dichotomy. Prince Andrew has been widely and justifiably condemned. No one has to be a fan of Meghan Markle just because Prince Andrew's wrongdoing is much worse."]
Andrew had no idea of sex trafficking at Epstein home in the US!!! Right… 😂😂😂😂 / []
This is an example of not asking somebody to take the shovel off of you! What chance do we stand really when this is the monarchy? Keep digging Loch Ness noncer / []
NOT ONLY are freemasons losing all their POWER, but individually THEY DON'T OWN WHAT THEY APPEAR TO OWN. it is a blackmail business culture and their PURPOSE IS TO 'FEED THE HIVE' so they are nothing unless they are seen to be 'ADDING TO THE HIVE' . they are ALWAYS LIQUIDATED and the assets go back into freemasonry. SO THEY ARE LOSING MONEY. THEY ARE LOSING THEIR IMAGE amongst their PEERS.  freemasons are NOT FRIENDS, they are ACCOMPLICES OR ADVERSARIES and will gladly rip off their closest friend to 'FEED THE HIVE'. they are involved in HUGE INVESTMENTS  THAT ARE ALL FALLING APART, and as soon as they are NOT FEEDING THE HIVE'. the SWARM ATTACKS THEM. just like prince andrew when he stopped 'FEEDING THE HIVE' as uk trade envoy and business partner of MAXWELL/ EPSTEIN. / []
I have heard all about how this interview was some kind of stroke of genius, and I don't see it at all.The photograph with Virginia Roberts is obviously overwhelmingly compelling but the interviewer doesn't bring anything extra out. / []
This man could not be more a D list actor at best. This interview is painful to watch. The amount of denial is staggering compared to the amount of disgust he should showing for the victims. / []
how did the royal family allow this to be aired this is brutal / []
So then he's saying that the Prince of Great Britian "crashed" on Epstein's couch. Is that what he is telling us? / []
Wow. I didn't watch this when it first aired, but I could tell from certain segments that it had been a disaster. I just didn't realise how disastrous it was. The obvious lying, the stuttering, the implausible excuses, the hedging around the issue of making a legal statement, and the pragmatic belief that friendship with a convicted sex offender cannot be regretted if you received social advantages from it all contributed to Prince Andrew's well-deserved downfall. Now we know that he paid off Virginia Roberts with several million, contradicting his convenient 'no recollection' claim. He is lucky he has not been arrested. / ["No way would he get arrested. No cop with a survival instinct would even be willing to carry out the arrest warrant! And that's just for starters...", 'If it was about Meghan you would have known about it the moment it aired', "@natalie-dianabusari2168 Huh? I knew about this interview the moment it aired. I just didn't watch it. Not interested in any Meghan ranting and raving, thanks.", 'Why does virginia target him she slept with a whole slew of men why not bring all of them up.', "\u200b@1234-m7wI'm not an Andrew fan but you have a very valid point.."]
He was patron of the NSPCC. So he was around children EVEN MORE and children who are abused,  to make it worse.  He invited him to his daughter’s PARTY. Like WHAT / ["There is no way that Jeffrey Epstein's neighbours were able to discern that he was a paedophile simply by watching his house, and Prince Andrew never saw any wrongdoing while being inside it."]
i believe the KARMA POLICE  sentenced him to LIVE WITH FERGIE and a load of corgis and be in £12m DEBT to the estate of queen elizabeth........ / []
Old lying ass / ["I'm shocked by how brazen his lies are.", 'Old sloppy lying ass']
17 million pounds payout later😂😂😂😂 / []
He has lied through his teeth you wouldn’t go and stay in his position with a convicted molester you wouldn’t go near the place at all very wierd / ['I had to stop the interview at that point. I have a relative who is in prison for an extremely serious crime, and I have not spoken to him at all. The idea that you need to cross the North Atlantic to speak to a convicted sex offender face-to-face in order to break off contact is so ludicrous I cannot even respond to it.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 totally agree']
Put them all on the Jeremy Kyle show and air their dirty laundry for the whole world to see. Ffs. / []
he said, 'NO SWEAT, AS I STINK OF GUILT'. / []

Andrew killed his mum off / []

Hes explaining too much, typical traits of a pathological liar / ['And stuttering, coughing, and his voice changes pitch as well.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 he just digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole. What a f--king t---er he is.']
Royal Paedophile.  No more no less. / []
So the Prince came to New York and needed a place to stay? Are you kidding me!!! / ['And the only place available was the house of a convicted sex offender.']
What a liar!!!!😮😮😮😮 His mom was ashamed I’m sure!!!! / ["The lies are so blatant and so infantile. It's no wonder his career went up in flames."]
Lol / []
In Jefferys House lol / []
Positive Action. What an earth is he on about. / ['Utter nonsense.', "I seriously think his idea is that if girls do things to him, it doesn't count as 'sex'. Because he's not 'doing it'. (I know, it's revolting, but I think that's his meaning.)"]
All he had to do was express regret and heartfelt condolences to the victims and slam JE and he would have weathered this storm. Instead he almost justifies JE actions and his own. Guilty or not this is a damming interview / ['All he had to do was be forthcoming back in 2011 about his contacts with Epstein. He thought he could fly under the radar, but his time and his privileges came to an end.']
An honest man says little, as the truth speaks for itself. A dishonest man speaks many words to deflect, evade, justify and invent.   The sheer volume of words a person gives in response to a simple yes or no question is often all you need to spot a lie. Let alone the stammering, feigned looks of shock that linger long enough to drop out of being sincere and become theatrics, the memory lapses, and head nodding and shaking at odds with the verbal response.   Many examples in this interview, but a classic is, “well we have this photo of you with your arm around Virginia”. Instead of answering, “It’s definitely a Photoshop fake because as I said, I’ve never met her”, he goes into a monologue of deflection such as, “Can’t be me because the photo was taken upstairs and I only stayed downstairs”, “I don’t remember Jeffrey ever having a camera”, “It’s a photo of a photo, so who can tell if it’s real?”, “I couldn’t have been there because in the photo I’m wearing my travelling clothes and I always dress formal when in the UK and in public”.   People who walk in straight lines don’t need twisted narratives to explain their journey.   And because he didn’t know the girl, and she wasn’t trafficked to him, and he didn’t dance with her at the club, and he didn’t go back to Maxwell’s home, and he didn’t go upstairs and pose for a trophy photo, and he didn’t have sex with her, he then settled her legal claim by paying her 12 million to go away, because that’s the behaviour of an innocent person? / ["It's definitely me in the photo, but I was never there.\nAlso, how does he know it's upstairs if he's only ever been on the ground floor.\nWhat a buffoon", 'Not to mention how cagey he became when he was asked about giving a sworn legal statement for his version of events.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 ...he said he would do be duty bound to do it and then he never did.']
This man has some of the best acting skills I’ve ever seen. / []
He is lying and you can see it his tone of the voice and expression. / ['Plus the obvious implausibility of his excuses. Never saw any wrongdoing? Yet even Donald Trump acknowledged that Epstein liked young girls.']
Just one more point, if you have a friend who is a convicted trafficker of children for sex and a paedophile, You don't have to do the honourable thing and fly over to another country to stay in their house then  break the friendship off.............all you do is text them and say  stay the fuck away from me and my kids forever. That's all they deserve 👏 / []
When ghillan gets out maybe Andy can take her to pizza express ,that will give her something to look forward to! / ["How on earth did he remember Pizza Express? I can't remember what I did on 10th March this year, let alone back in 2002!"]
Great journalists, excellent, polite and very professional. Andrew shows lack of respect for underage girls and shows how he was raised: he was educated knowing and feeling himself better than every body else. Elizabeth was a bad mother, never educated this piece if s***, because he knows that the institution will clean up his mess. The education received by this pedophile lacks responsibility and compassion. Elizabeth didn’t do any good job as a mother. / []
Just a normal shooting weekend, so do they serve Lobster or crab sticks. What's a normal shooting weekend mean to a peasant like me. / []
I remember him, I see him at funerals alot. / []
What a bloody lier!!! / []
If anyone can not tell this man is a complete liar..........You got no Brains!!!!  professional who specializes in Body language, movements, of facial and moving of hands...............Very scary / []
Some people are accomplished liars and really don't comprehend how serious signing depositions is. / []
Hasn't she heard of Photoshop? / ['Are you having a laugh']
Anyone can describe things. / []
HOW DOES HE KNOW ITS TAKEN UPSTAIRS IF HE CANT REMEMBER OR IF IT COULD BE FAKE? CLEARLY IT MYST BE REAL IF HE CAN TELL THAT ITS EPSTEIS UPSTAIRS RIGHT ??! / []
One of THE WORST lie faces I've EVER seen!! My kids would put this pecker head to shame 🤦‍♀️ / []
Whatta mumbling fumbler.   Lies, Lies, Lies, Yeah!!!! King Charles III will see what will happen next. / []
This guy sounds uncomfortable with the questions.......where are the body language experts to articulate the voice going up & down with some questions,  hands , facial expressions / []
We should not be seen together let’s go for a walk in the park / ['Oh, and how about dinner afterwards?']
My judgement was colored by my `tendency to be too honorable` is ONE way to say a sex addiction. / []
He’s not the only one / []
Just the pictures of epstein are creepy to me, the thought of staying at one of his homes, blech and scary. / []
arrest the pedo / []
Why in the goodness did he agree to this interview? He really underestimate how stupid & pathetic he comes off. / ['When you get indulged your whole life and told you are amazing and superior, you are oblivious to the fact you are actually an imbecile.', "Remember that this first was revealed back in 2011. So he had years of keeping quiet, evidently in the belief that he could brush Virginia Roberts' accusations under the carpet."]
Andrew sought out the nasty folks. He said he wants to learn.   My Word! Learn what my dear boy? / []
I squirmed when he said he found it to be "CONVENIENT" that he remained at Epstein's house after he allegedly was there to break off their friendship. The audacity is absurd. / ['I agree! This was just cringing from start to finish. So embarrassing. His audacity and ignorance have me dumbfounded.', 'Hotels are pretty expensive in New York. 😆🙄', 'calling him would be the chickens way. he is too honorable']
He was set up as he was royal..simple! / []
So this 17 Yr old girl came out when she was in her 40's ..wtf / ['No, she had already made te allegations a long time ago. She did not make a deposition until 2015, but the claims first surfaced in 2011.']
Tbh I think he is being honest 🤔 jst so sad he fell in with the wrong company..he was a victim himself / ['He fell in with the wrong company... yes. Which is why he had a duty to be forthcoming when the allegations of sexual abuse against him first surfaced, right?']
But what about the others who were involved in this? I doubt Prince Andrew was the only one / ['I totally agree.']
"my tendency to be too honourable" WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT? He was a known prolific sex offender! / []
Whose idea was this interview?  He sounds like a lying child. / []
Such an uncomfortable watch…. / []
Lol he doesn't sweat???? Bull crap..he is probably sweating now!!! Lol tell him to take his coat off!! Lol Disgusting!! Doesn't remember the photo??? DRUNK MAYBE??? LOL / []
He is lying. His Mommy paid him out of this,, wonder how many times she has paid him out of scandals??? He needs to get it together. Mommy is not around to protect her perverted son  now!!! / []
wow...what a bad liar!!!!! Idiot!!! / []
It’s a train smash every time I watch this.  I’m sure it is the same for andrew / []
Andrew is putting on a show.  He is the most entitled, I’ll-tempered and manipulative person. / []
Worst liar ever 🤢 / []
he never says "I did not have sex with under age girls" which is what he should have said if he was not guilty. / ['Yep. Lack of an explicit denial can often be a sign of concealment or outright deceit.', "also, he never condemns Epstein. In fact he seems to really appreciate the guy.  I mean if he wasn't involved in something shady he would be angry and denying all"]
Hearing Prince Andrew pontificate - and it really is all about him - reminds me of some of the old film footage I have seen of his late Great Uncle and former King Edward VIII.  Arrogance, entitlement, self-serving, and tone deaf to how his own behavior is seen by others.  With some luck, maybe he will just disappear from the Royal Family and fade into oblivion.  Ah yes, wishful thinking on my part. / []
🤤🧠💨🧠💨🤤🧠💨🤤🧠💨🤤🧠💨🧠🤤I🧠💨      've never heard a GROWN ASS man STUTTER so much In a interview ..LMFAO🤤 / []
🌕🌘🌒🌕🌘🌒🌕🌘🌒🌕🌘🌒🌕🌒🌘...and the Award for WORST CAREER DECISION GOES TO......#Andrew, his Lawyer & his PR Team! / []
Don’t let Trump get interviewed by this lady. He’d be toast. She was on point. “He was a sex offender.” / []
Why did this man do this???? He just should have said "I am guilty....goodbye". / []
That's interesting... a prince from a powerful country that knows nothing about what is happening abroad... / ["When all Jeffrey Epstein's neighbours had to do was look at his house or his island."]
It has never never been stated that Andrew has a severe speech impediment, his stutter is very prominent.Why was it never addressed.Maybe it only comes out when he is telling bare faced lies. Oh my God this man is a peodophile and is getting away with it .God help the little children / []
This guy reminds me of something left on the pavement by a passing dog. / []
Not about partying….Absolutely not. This guy is so memeable. / []
The photo they kept showing of him with the girl looks perfectly fine to me, she looked very happy in the picture, don’t see what the problem is, I guess when you had an opportunity to rip off a royalty you’d go all the way out to tear them down. Easy for us to judge, just think if you were a man and a prince, you’d probably not a better version than him. / ['Oh goodness a die hard royalist. How do you feel about Epstein and maxwell hanging out at the Queen’s cabin?', "The photo is perfectly fine, and like he said, sex is a positive thing, it is not immoral. Its not as if girls are saints, they are turned on by powerful men, they fantasise being raped, they love money, they advertise themselves half naked to the world wearing short skirts and bikinis. I won't judge him and conclude he done wrong or right because I don't have any evidence. I appreciate our late Queen even more now as a remarkable leader having to deal with all of these kinds of things yet she remained a stoic constant in her duty.", 'She was probably smiling by putting on a front because the girls were told they were in danger as were their families if they tried to escape!!']
Your ignorance is commendable, you stupid fuck! / []
At 8:59 he says “ it was inappropriate for us to be SEEN together!” That says a lot to me. It says to me, that they need to be more discreet, not that they won’t be friends anymore, only that they can’t be seen together, and now have to hide it better. Quite telling. / ['Good point indeed.', 'I was thinking that as well.', 'can’t e be friends now he’s convicted. But could’ve been if you never got caught 🤣🤣🤣🤣', 'Thinking the same.']
The sweating bit is amazing 😂😂😂 / []
Prince Andrew you are a terrible liar! / []
Nice one Andy.......that'll sort it 👍 / []
That interview didn't do him any favours lol he contradicted himself so  much liar !! / []
11:18 that question about the dinner party, you can see him begin to be thrown of course. And he looked so awkward, you can see his face lying, and the best thing he isn’t even convincing himself ! / []
And there are people out there who preached that we should all show respect for Andrew because he lost his mother the Queen. I will give this man respect, he doesn’t deserve any respect he didn’t respect the victims. Prince Andrew should have sent to the United States and made to give a evidence in court, if he had nothing to hide, and he believed in his innocence then he should have gone, but what did we find, he paid off the victim, and also I do suspect it was paid to her along with a vailed threat of what could happen to her if she carried on.  If I or any of you had done anything remotely close to what he had done, we would be locked up, and rightly so, but because mummy was the Queen, and he was the favourite son he got away with it.  People who even think they can defend this man, preach about respect and how we need to respect the monarchy and this man and I’m sorry I have no respect for Andrew, or the people or protected him, and that includes the Queen. / []
Emily Maitlis interview technique is *BRILLIANT* here. You only have to look as Andrews body language to see the *EVIDENCE* that he knew he was *SUNK* by this woman! / ['Apparently, he was pleased with the interview shortly afterwards until the proverbial hit the fan.']
The entire thing sounds like Andrew was being used by Ebstein probably to try to appear to be still socially acceptable. The dinner party with Andrew implied to be the guest of honor. Why else would Ebstein claim the dinner was in Andrew's honor?! Ebstein was bragging that Andrew was at Ebstein's home. Very chummy sounding. / []
He is a despicable pedophile. There is evidence regarding his crimes against CHILDREN that the FBI hasn't released......YET. / []
Does he really think anyone believes him? LMAO / []
I just can't stop watching it ... it's totally embarrassing poor prince Andy Pandy ... send him to The Bahamas like they had to do with the other totally embarrassing royal Edward 8th  who was another liability ... wake up all you silly little flag waving people.. it's total cringing embarrassing stuff.. Well done Emily you are a 'Boss' presenter.. / []
I have to share this where ever people are awake. Prince Andrew sexually violated his own daughter at his own mother (The Queens) funeral. What The Fuck. Please Share this before they also wants to kill Meghan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnghHLA4aYE / []
Does he think that all that utter bumbeling  crap he's come out with will be swallowed by people? Wake up Andy Randy you're a dope & laughing stock if you think people will swallow that.. if anyone is clean and innocent they would not hand over 12 million to shhhh it all up , get real Andy the game's up mate... that 12 million could have bought a few dialyasis machines for the NHS... Corrupt establishment again covering up, it's gone on for years right back to The Cleveland Street Scandal in Victorian times . Send him to the Bahamas like his Uncle Edward 8th who spent millions on jewelery for Wallace Simpson and was a Nazi sympathiser.. I do wish our stupid little flag waving people would Wake up & smell the coffee... / []
Now we know how two face  liars royals really are / []
STRANGER DANGER!! / []
40:23 winking nervously means “your are hiding something.” / []
Best comment I’ve seen   When you turn 100, you get a letter from the Queen.  When you turn 13, you get a text from Andrew 🤣 / ['Thanks for the laugh!']
Make him pay taxes now, past, present and future / []
10:21 He has a tongue slip and he actually admits saying "he didn't go into a conversation about what i have been doing" then he corrects himself to "what he has been doing" . Even his brain and subconscious cannot take this many lies. This should stay in archives to show how powerful families could get away with a horrid crime in 21st century..... / ['Great catch!']
This is a huge embarrassment to the Royal family and the people of the UK and everywhere else the Royal family has affairs. He is clearly lying; I'm assuming they've got makeup on him to avoid the face flushes. The fact that still, to this day, he has faced no consequences for this speaks absolute volumes. Emily Maitlis deserves an incredible pay rise for this and I hope it propels her career.  It is so shockingly and blatantly obvious that he is lying. A stain on the UK. Disgusting. / ["Even though I support our constitutional monarchy, there's no denying that the Royal Family has shown tremendous lack of judgement with some of its associations, most notably Andrew and Epstein, and Jimmy Saville."]
The body language in facial expressions of this royal person show lies in him / []
My sister was raped by my best friend so when he got out of prison I went and stayed at his house because it was convenient and I wanted to tell him that we couldn’t be friends anymore. To call him would be the chicken way out, to just not call him at all is absurd. He also had about 500 other victims and I’m sure they would understand my 4 days stay / ['😂💀', '“I had to go and tell him, I had to show leadership…”  That’s most likely what the queen very sternly conveyed to him.']
prince Andrew is innocent War hero / ['Are you that stupid', 'The only person he would save, would be himself']
"My tendency to be too honourable."  What!? / []
it will be much better is he says I met her, but I never had sex with her, just like Clinton. / []
It’s actually hilarious how he tries to justify himself by obsessing over the schematics of what she says. Like when she said ‘you invited Jeffrey Epstein to a party at Windsor castle’ he says ‘umm…nooo? It was simply a shooting party’ or ‘You went to his 2010 party as a guest of honour even after breaking contact with him?’ ‘Umm…no??? It was simply a small dinner; only 8 or so people were there! Definitely no party’. I don’t get the point of this because either way he’s proving her point that he was consistently friends with Epstein even AFTER his conviction / ["It's deflection."]
Why oh why did he do this or the people around him not put him in a straight jacket. This 50 minute interview that he didn’t have to do destroyed his life and badly damaged the monarchy!! / []
Come on Andrew you knew exactly what was going on.  All your silly facial expressions in this interview. Your guilty....... / ["All his claims of ignorance are straight lies. The police found incriminating photographs and massage materials on Epstein's property (I think both times they arrested him), and Epstein's neighbours were well aware of the perversions going on at his house and on his island, which was nicknamed 'Paedophile Island'."]
Haha no recolection ov anything ,bar going to pizza express , jefree i still love you , pedos will aleays stick the gither , should be jailed / []
For Heaven's sake. / []
He's so happy Jeffrey's dead. / []
Oh, goodness. It’s glaringly obvious with his body language, stuttering, and backtracking that he is lying.   This is embarrassing. / ["The 'I never spoke to him again' switching straight into admitting that he had a party with Epstein was horrific."]
So Epstein wasn't a close friend but he had to fly to America to tell him that he couldn't be friends anymore? 🤔 / []
There is no doubt this is a pack of lies. / []
"Dooked of York"... LOL... This Prince has got to go... GUILTY!!!!!!! / []
“You could not spend time around him and not know” so Trump & Clinton knew and we’re US presidents. / []
This is so fun to watch haha lying to his teeth / []
Your a sexual predator Andrew,  your brother was jimmy saviles best pal who was procuring children for your pleasure and your rich and famous friend's.  You think that your untouchable because of your bloodline. Your mother paid off one of your many victims. The empire will fall, humanity is awaking from its slumber / []
Andrew is full of BS. Being in his high profile position, he would have been well informed about Jeffrey Epstein's affairs. It seems that Andrew knew exactly what Jeffrey Epstein was and that's precisely why he stayed with him a couple times of year. / []
A very disgusting individual. / []
He's SOOOO guilty! / []
He wouldn't know the truth if it gave him a foot massage / []
His way of saying bizarre things as if they're obvious is such a delight / ["Sweat glands, Pizza Express, positive action, we can't prove if the picture is fake...", "He doesn't live in the same reality as normal people and he's quite obviously never been called out on his bullshit 😂", 'hes too honourable']
Pince Andrew was stet up by his frend and the lady Pince Andrew knew thay both did it for the money I do so feel for Pince Andrew  must be so hard for him / []
Hee something else / []
Entitled is all I'm seeing,a spoiled big boy. / []
Lie detektor test  He lie so bad / []
The late Queen ERII produced pretty inutile sons. This only a proof. / []
I feel pity for these pathetic royal worshippers who have such meaningless lives that they live vicariously through an obviously dysfunctional family. / ['I like the monarchy as it provides a limit to state power and also a source of patriotism. They can also do a lot of service; Princess Anne has been one of themost dignified, hardest working royals for decades.']
The thing is, i actually want to believe him, I want it all to be false, but I just can't he looks guilty as sin / ['His scurrilous and shameless behaviour has betrayed all those who respected and loved him.']
Course Andy ud come across him did u smell his money 💲 / []
just a few points i can see from this, no original copy of the photo exists, she claims he sweated profusely, in this interview being asked some very awkward questions, he is a dry as a bone. / []
Was it a birthday party? Oh no, just a ordinary old shooting party weekend 😂😂😂😂😂 / []
What we're really witnessing is a dirty old man who got caught at a human "sex buffet" of VERY young women (and probably young lads also). Epstein surely had something that he was holding over the royal's head... scenario - blackmail, threats to the outdated, useless monarchy, and enormous pressure = "suicide" ?  NOT BLOODY LIKELY!  No one listened to Diana Spencer as she was fearing the Crown...she was killed in an "accident". These people are just plain evil.  PERIOD! / []
His stories are more crooked than his bottom teeth / []
As much I don't like the Royal family I despise this woman more so obvious she doing this for money. You don't come forward 20 years later if you were so affected by this. Put money on it she was running after him she was no saint. / ['Many, if not most, victims of child sexual molestation come forward years after the alleged abuse. Being a saint is irrelevant. A victim is a victim, regardless of their personal character.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 Yes also when they need money, I not buying at of it she could of destroyed him court she said she wanted proper justice, but she took the money that tells me everything.', "@paulmcnamara9272 Money as compensation for a serious crime is justice. That is why civil law exists. Her lawyers repeatedly asked Prince Andrew to come and make a sworn statement. He said he would, but he didn't. Instead, he paid her off."]
Pervert supporter / []
i feel pity for the Queen that her 2 sons (Charles and especially Andrew) was incredibly a huge head ache for her. / ["Charles has beenfirm on distancing himself from Prince Andrew, and his problems are nothing compared to Andrew's wilful self-delusion, lying, and hypocrisy about his friendship with a convicted sex offender. (Though in the cause of honesy, I must also point out that Princes Phillip and Charles were utterly wrong to have entertained Jimmy Saville for years.)"]
The most horrifying part of this interview was when he admitted introducing Epstein to his daughter. That makes my head hurt and makes me sick to my stomach. / ['he has a daughter but still no empathy for those young women', 'I thought the most horrifying part was the hypocrisy.']
"My judgement was colored by my tendency is to be too honorable"...if he says so..... / []
This lady should have been a lawyer.. criminal lawyer’s position suits her way.. very respectful lady yet c nailed him😂 / []
Shame on so called royal. His body language is clearly indicating that he is a real pervert 😡😡 / ['She was money grabbing ho and a trollop she was no better.']
“He didn’t go into much depth about what I was doing, he! was doing” just gave himself away. / []
He is absolutely guilty of being a disgusting person and it’s sad to see him not take accountability for his actions / ['hes too honourable', 'Because the justice department is only there for punishing the powerless people .']
I have never heard such babble in my entire life. / []
It’s simple: if he’d never had sex with the girls trafficked by his good friend he wouldn’t have had to “rack his brain over and over”. He’s getting entangled in his own lies. / ['Excellent point.']
Shame on Andew.  It seems he was at these homes to be with young girls who were being trafficked. / []
SCUM WHO WAS ALLOWED TO PAY OFF HE LADY HE SEDUCED AS A YOUNG TRAFFICKED GIRL. BOOOOOOOOOOOO / []
Here you go people, everything you need to see here…get rid of the royal family / ["The Royal Family isn't the issue. It's paedophilia, nepotism, and intimidation which creates these scandals. Many other people implicated in these crimes are not royals."]
R . . / []
I didn't stay there because of him , I was there because of her.. and she is doing 20 years. / ['And he has been curiously silent on that.']
This interview is the 2nd worst car crash the Royal family have ever arranged / []
Damn my tendancy to be too honourable - always gets me in to trouble 🤣 / []
Fecking creep. / []
Goddam creep. / []
Prince Andrew : - "He was in and out all over the place...."  Disgusting!! / []
My neighbour was one of the Queen’s butlers. He said all the family were lovely except Andrew who he described as a foul mouthed bully. / ['I did read that Prince Andrew has been criticised many times for other issues, including a lack of transparency over his finances and his apparent lack of courteousness.', 'His behaviour has now been recently confirmed by an ex-Royal Protection Officer for the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace.  Interview can be found on YouTube and was posted a few days ago.']
He only loves rich people so he can get a free ride!!!  Hes a blatant liar.  Arrogant.  Entitled. / []
He needs to pay / ['He already has paid the woman he claimed he had never met. He even admitted in the settlement that denying her allegations was harmful.']
He is a lier / []
He s a lier. But he has  convinced himself that he is telling the truth.  He has been found out that's all that he is an alleged sex abuser and is trying to  defend himself. Lol. / ["I don't think he is convinced that he is telling the truth. The dinner party issue was a big tell."]
The interviewer came with receipts 🤣🤣🤣, every question became harder to answer 🤣🤣 / []
Once he had been accused of being a sex offender, I stayed with him.  Biggest mistake Andrew / []
Even when he's talking about his royal duties, he's still stumbling and appears like he doesn't know what he's talking about. Listening to him makes me feel uncomfortable because he's squirming around every question. Did he really prepare for this?? / []
Seems to be telling the truth, why would he agree to the interview if he weren't sure of his innocence? I'm no royalist. / ["He's defo not innocent", 'Many people do interviews to clear the air, regardless of whether they are telling the truth or not. Jimmy Saville gave interviews.']
Funny enough. What the hell is funny about it? / ['You tell me! I noticed that as well! His total lack of empathy and refusal to strongly condemn child sexual molestation spoke volumes.']
Like watching a man struggling to get out of a straight jacket, and all his antics just makes it tighter. / []
He is so guilty ! Put him in jail Melissa / []
Bought his freedom while lying thru his teeth. Should be in jail mdfkr. / []
I’d like to see the back of his shirt. Bet it was soaking. / []
When the first allegations came out I thought "well that's abit strange, I don't remember that." Those are not the words  of a man who knows he hasn't done anything of the sort. Someone makes an allegation like that against me, I would be utterly dumbfounded and postively adamant about making it absolutely clear, out of respect for my name and person, to everybody that it never happened and that the accuser, evidentally a pathological liar, needs urgent help / ["Exactly. If it didn't happen, the accuser is a liar. But he is very careful not to say that, even though he insists that nothing of the kind ever happened.", 'I thought the exact same!!!!', '\u200b@Künstlerin-DAB1995  he even praises the girls for speaking up at one point. Like hello, they are calling you a sex offender. Caught between trying to lie his way out of trouble and playing the honorable prince card and it did not work.']
Omg...What an embarrassing interview...Brilliant journalist and "sticking his foot in his mouth" Prince Andrew... / []
What a shame to the Queen Mother and the country! / ['The good people who respected this man are now left with shame and have to break off their relationship with him. He evidently never considered his supporters when he chose to go gallivanting around own with a convicted sex offender.']
If he’s never been upstairs in maxwells house in Belgravia,how did he recognise it in the photo? / []
Andrew brush it under the carpet and forget it happened kind of bloke. So out of touch with reality, See no evil,  Speak no  evil,  Hear no evil comes to mind. / []
‘My tendency to be honourable’ disgusting little man protected by the fact his mummy was queen. Rank / []
Andrew looks like he was school, over and over. A calculated descension. I can't help but think. Of the power and. The gravy train have. Sink or swim. The story here. How much of. Went on. Who knows what. If anything. There would be a lot of facts. That would never be known about, ever. Say if this did not end up in a trail. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. You're a star, Prince Andrew. ,, / []
Party prince 😂😂😂 / []
what's your greatest weakness? mine is my tendency to be too honorable... but that's just the way it is. / []
So these moral experts had no clue as to what was going on with the people they were hanging out with? Listen, I love Her Royal Highness Elizabeth II, but this is clearly a case of an entitled son, going far out of his families morals for his own fun, and that's just what it is. I have to say tho, I can't begin to imagine Andrew's upbringing or what that was, as I'm sure he can't imagine my own, but he sought pleasures outside of the ones his family provided and now he's paying the price. I do hope he wasn't "getting off" on the demise of others who had no say in their downfall (sex-trafficed victims) but like, I mean, you're in a high position to deal with the leaders of whatever category they're leading in, whether it be moral high-ground, or moral low-ground, the mighty are always going to be in the midst of royals and power. If anything dude, use your experience to coach future royals how NOT to do, what you felt you NEEDED to, to try "escaping" from the morality of your own family and the sanctity of what royalty means. Teach the children in your family that they are at the front lines of modern morality, and that it's NOT A PUNISHMENT, but a GIFT! Your Mother used it as a gift, so I have to believe others can too! Because it's not, it's actually a way of getting through your life, acting on those principals, and garnering love and admiration from "lay-people" or whatever you wanna call the rest of society. Be an example that people can follow because hell or high-water, we're trying our best to follow good examples, and unfortunately, you were be-witched by the wrong person, and fell prey to the media sensationalism that has made this video. Let this be a lesson to DO BETTER. TEACH BETTER. INFORM STRONGER, and LOVE STRONGER! I know how I sound and I'm sure I'll get lots of hate over saying all this, but your life isn't over mate! If you stand up strong and use your experiences as a message to teach from your mistakes, that's all anyone can really do right? Do that! Please? And please talk to your brother. He wants to slim things down for taxpayer benefits, I get it, but the one thing your Mother's funeral taught us, was that the world is definitely paying full attention, and her example was incredibly gracious and beautiful. God bless you all and your family, and I hope you all stay strong and prosper for generations to come. Maybe it's okay that you guys get to lead the world in how families should operate? I dunno. Maybe not, what do I Know? I'm just an American boy that's been fascinated by your Mother. Just speaking to you out of care and concern for the legacy she left behind and how you can build upon that, even now. You still have a chance mate! (I say mate like I use that alot and I dont, just trying to be relatable) / ["After re reading that, I'm sure I won't be well received in what I've said, but I stand by it all. Human beings, all of us, are just human beings. The idea that one should know more or better than anyone else is false to me. We all come from our own experiences and our own relationships with God, or whatever higher power you choose to believe in. I do fear for those who only believe in themselves tho."]
I keep watching this interview I think because it makes me feel like if I’m having a bad day it just shows things could get much worse he is a disaster. / []
Disgrace / []
Oh man 😂 this guy is so bad at lying / []
I honestly don't know who is more pathetic Andrew or Micheal Jackson... Jackson told the world " i have never had plastic surgery "  Now Andrew is saying  " yes that is me in that picture, but it's not my arm around her".... W.T.F. / []
“I’ve never felt the need to go potty.” Lies! We all do. / []
There's something just wrong about Prince Andrew.... have the utmost respect for the monarchy but Andrew is dodgy, he's arrogant, entitled and just sleazy. I feel so sorry for Fergie and his daughters. VILE. / ['Totally agree, and alleged reports about his discourteous behaviour seem to confirm that.']
The truth always surfaces / []
To be fair, he’s not producing a bead of sweat here when most of us would have thrown up already.   He may be telling the truth.   Lol. / []
Omg andrew these are the explanations really? No prince because I don’t believe in those titles 🙄🙄🙄 / []
I think he is innocent. / ['Because you’re a sheep. The propaganda the royal family put out is the only reason you’d think he’s innocent. 12 million in a settlement is a massive indicator of guilt you brainless fud', '@Kyle_P2022 yes as opposed to you who jsut knows all the truths. Dont make me laugh. You "woke" people are the least intelligent around. Thats why you need to tell people how woke you are. Now run along.', '@Kyle_P2022 paying a settlement by a rich person and famous person to avoid going to court is a well known way to avoid a prolonged and even more expensive case. You really arent good at this huh. plenty of famous peopel pay settlements who are innocent. But against your personal attacks just show how desperate and insecure you are. keep it up. you are sooo woke.', '@flightyrisky1282 Yes, plenty of famous people do settle cases. But for no where near £12 million you moron. \n\nYou’re literally one a tiny group who believe he’s innocent! So this girl is just lying??']
16:02 interviewer “yeah!”   Lol.  Best moment that shouted “you dirty old pedo”! / []
We've all got that uncle that's a sex offender (Chris rock) we just had to walk it off.. Not that Andrew is, 16 is the law in the UK so he's not a sex offender, but he's a sad case if he's having sex with 17 year olds I'd feel sick having sex with someone 20 years younger than me, abusing their innocence, gimme a dirty old cow anyday, even when I was 18 I wanted a woman like Madonna not Britney spears but hey that's just me I guess / []
Interviewer: Here’s a shovel  Prince Anonce: Splendid! / ['lmao']
It's hard to believe if he's telling the truth. I had someone there for ten years an I didn't know he was a rapist. / ['It is definitely possible that you can be unaware of someone\'s sex crimes. Many were unaware of Harvey Weinstein\'s rapes, for example. But in Epstein\'s case, Donald Trump was on record saying that Epstein liked little girls, and Epstein\'s neighbours were so familiar with the trainline of underaged girls coming to and from his residences that they named his island "Paedophile Island". The police also found a ton of compromising evidence inside his property.']
He Promotes the NSPCC!  🤯🤯 it doesn't take a genius, to nip that in the bud, quick style!! DB* / []
Is there even one person that has watched this that doesn’t think he’s lying 🤣 / []
Phoenix / []
When he said “i don’t remember going upstairs in the house” he knew he fucked up. / []
it was convenient to stay at a pedophiles house, in fact it was honourable to do so whilst said pedophile was walking in and out of the house with underage girls, which he was blind to. / ['biggest f up']
So he has "No recollection". / []
A Royal man who is naive and a friend of the criminal celebrity. / []
Why are you Pressured Prince Andrews?? The moment the women started the Menstruations she become a adult woman. 17 years old is old enough to make your own decisions!! Why this woman was doing there in the first place!! She was looking for attention or meet famous people or money? This  woman you called manor was adult enough to make her own decisions. She can stay in the house or she can go!! Why for God sick you are accusing Prince Andrews?? I believe all this woman was looking for money. Prince Andrews is no responsible for others mistakes and  decisions. I married I was 17 years old!! And?? You all are very wrong!?  This woman wants attention  . This is my point of view!! Prince Andrews refunded to have any intimacy contact with this woman. She was frustrated because Prince Andrews ignore her!! Clear?? / ["Why this pressure??? Prince Andrews had contact with some one with other mentality don't mean Prince Andrews have the some mentality.. He was a fateful Husband he is a Magnificent Father Queen Elizabeth His mother gived Prince Andrews a excellent education!! Stop!! And apologies to Prince Andrews!? 🇪🇺", 'Fucks sake. What a dense comment']
It's crazy that he thinks the public sould believe this rubbish / []
Put it behind you. Time you will recover. Much sadness for your mother and your loss. You never whined like Harry.. Charles destroyed  a young bride.. Yet you never slung that in his face. / ["Putting aside the claim that 'Charles destroyed a young bride' (a heavy exaggeration), even that is nothing compared to continuing to fraternise with a convicted sex offender, surely?"]
He chose to speak out  He hasn’t been convicted of anything  All is fine  He is nice but dim  He wouldn’t of known or understood what was going on / ['So why did he pay off Virginia Roberts with millions?', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 why does anyone pay anyone? It’s easier than being dragged through court etc\n\nStill doesn’t = guilty', "@DigitalDaffodil It doesn't equal guilt, but it is often a tacit admission of guilt. In his settlement, Prince Andrew accepted that his denials had been damaging to Virginia Roberts. A strange thing to accept if you claim the accusations are untrue.", '@Musicienne-DAB1995 isn’t guilt. End of']
The arrogance of this man is quite frightening / []
If he watches this interview himself. I bet he is shitting it think I well fucked this up lol / []
I still want to know what actual crime he committed. And what happened to innocent until proven guilty in a court of law? / ['Sexual contact with a known victim of sex trafficking, potentially underage (according to state). And he paid off his accuser with millions and acknowledged that it was harmful to deny her accusations.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 she was 17. In the photo she has her arm around him and is smiling.

👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼BBC for keeping the comments open / []
Lying through his teeth / []
Andrew.you should never av agreed 2 av this interview.you r not well prepared b4 hand.u lie n lie all the way through. / []
He made the mistake of his life,by doing this interview.sometimes,its better to keep ur mouth shut. / []
Oh, yeah! BY THE WAY! What happened to THIS A**HOLE?? Wasn't he supposed to have some sort of a trial in the States?? ...LAST I HEARD at least!...well ??? / []
He never went upstairs but can categorically and  clearly state it's upstairs that ,that photo was taken. / []
This is truly a dull era of human history when a prince can't get head without a public inquest. Dark days indeed / []
The sweat logic is truly otherworldly. Never witnessed a man who literally cannot lie. / []
As she mentions that Jon Brockman was there, Andrew looks obviously stunned & even mutters "really "? as she begins to recall his statement. Then he turns around & says "I don't know who he is".   Such a sorry excuse of a man. Don't do something/anything that you would be too ashamed to admit to. / []
He was involved in  That liar / []
Prince Andrew: “No, I couldn’t have been there because I don’t exist.” / []
I don't think I've ever seen such a bad liar before. I have to admit though, he danced around a flat put denial quite well. He was obviously trying not to say anything that could be legally damaging.  Impressive dancing lol / []
She tripped me out when she said he’s being utterly convinced he’s telling the truth😂🤥😃😂 when he know he’s lying / []
Who from Andrews team let him go on this interview?! They need to be fired lol. / []
He did well before opening his mouth. / []
His story is as straight as his tie. / []
What the h*** give em a castle / []
This guy is so guilty it's funny / []
You must of been on drugs to not remember anything / []
What a loser.  Sickening to watch.  Hilarious liar.    Wonder why he was the queens favourite-a top class liar. / []
Strange his brother had a good friend who turns out the be Britain’s worst child sex offender and he  never know either how unlucky are they how strange / []
he is such an embarrassment to the UK...sicko / []
🤪😜 / []
Sas killed , Epstein .he new to much on to many people ,and was ready to open a can of worms . But he didt play ball and Epstein was scap goat . Terrible money can get u away with a lot . / []
I love this ,I don't sweat lol . He got Epstein bumped off , and the money contacts , makes things happen simple / []
Wow this is chilling / []
Try listening to 48:07 again Mister!!! / []
Yet people still hate Meghan more than him! This world is sick / ["Prince Andrew's fall from grace has been sudden and well-deserved. I doubt anyone hates Meghan Markle more than him. It's possible to not be a fan of either, albeit for different reasons.", '@Musicienne-DAB1995 sadly British public hates her more. Daily Mail wrote 19 articles about Meghan and 1 about Prince Andrew around HM funeral. Obviously none of the articles was mentioning anything positive about her. I’ve seen thousands of tiktoks bitching about her and very few about him']
After this, people are still supporting royals. Shameful / ['Nothing wrong with supporting our constiitutional monarchy nor the royals who do not disgrace their family as Andrew has done.']
A charlatan , a mendacious piece of ordure... / []
Is this the world we want to bring our children into? How humanity will move on with such actions that takes us back centuries? Horrifying / ["The frightening thing for Britain and the best thing for her enemies is that these demons who ruled this country, will only pass the torch to young demons like them as they don't trust descent or faithful human beings so expect this misery to last for centuries. It's a curse that won't go away. They will groom young statesman to become paedos too."]
This is too cringe / []
Where's the body language expert? / []
too honorable???? omg  what the hell happened at birth / []
if he dont drink how come he dont remember / []
i dunno what  he was thinking coming out and doing this interview . This video confirmed that hes guilty  and his  body language oh my god!!!!!! he fit for a pedo ... / []
He keeps saying "funny enough." But whats funny about any of the material in this interview? / []
Megan Markle gets more stick and nobody really knows the reasons, if only brits focused on this sex predator / ["Don't know where you got that from, but you're on a video full of many British people condemning Andrew. He lost his titles, many alliances, and has been shunned from public life."]
He said he was hardly a close friend yet also says he HAD to go and seen him face to face to explain why he could no longer see him? Epstein was a wise enough man to realise the Queens son would no longer be having contact with a convicted sex offender / []
And this guy was allowed to trot around proudly in the public spectacle of a funeral and wear his service uniform for the vigil. He is a disgraced pedophile. If you’re not making him go through a trial at least don’t let him trot about / []
If he weren't part of the "royal family" i would just call him a spoiled brat (or spoilt, i should write!), but considering his "status" i am going to call him an annoying yapping dog who's been excessively pampered throughout his whole life. / []
31:53 what the fuck does he mean by positive act.😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
The verbal gymnastics he’s doing 😂😂😂😂😂he’s a disgusting man / []
Lmao he hang out with jeffrey to tell jeffrey that he couldn't hang out with jeffrey anymore / []
13:42 😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Buddy is a terrible liar / []
What a terrible shame. / []
This man ( boy) has never taken any responsibility for his transgressions… awful job of lying…. He has been acting like ram in sheep’s clothing…horrible lack of really boundaries, nor does anyone remember…. Lame prince / []
I'm quite sure it started out from his navy time. I've heard quite often about the lavish and scandalous 'celebration' take place on ships. there is even documentary about it in USA naval. and yes he is British, but I think all navy in this world are prone to experience this kind of things. / []
Epically the WORST INTERVIEW EVER! OMG! For real Dude?? He is so stupid... She dropped BOMB after BOMB on his sorry A$$! She was Brilliant and he definitely did not see it coming. What a douche bag, Tax Payer, Grifter... / []
About the photograph, he keeps repeating that he doesn't remember that photo ever being taken. I think that's his anchor. He probably does not remember the photo being taken, but he does remember that night with Virginia Roberts (and the other nights). I think he keeps repeating that so that he doesn't slip up and accidentally tell the truth. / []
what a bold face liar  !!! / []
I've rarely seen someone lying so nervously 😅 / []
We do not have enough brilliant journalist like Emily in the U.K. She asked all the tough questions because she is a professional and impartial. If it was Piers Morgan he would have been licking Andrews his boots. / []
You weren't good friends but felt it necessary to tell him in person you couldn't associate with him anymore??  GTFO / []
You know, with Epstein, the more I learn about that guy, the more I don’t care for him / []
This interview is disgusting!!! He takes accountability for nothing!!! Who does he think he’s fooling? He is such a disgusting liar / []
This was painful to watch because it's so obvious he was lying.  If he had of said, look I'm no angel but I would never knowingly have sex with an underage girl, it would have been a little more believable.  And also, he should have admitted to the friendship and said even though Jeffrey was doing these awful things he was always good to me and it was hard to just cut him off or even say I was trying to get him help because he was a friend. He should have somebody better coaching him beforehand. / []
Pizza express in woking IM DONE ..don't bring them in to it. Man said think of an alibi quick / []
he fact she said 'tramp nightclub' and he follows by saying he's never been to TrampS  (correct name) shows in fact you know where and what Tramps is or you would of called it tramp LOL you idiot. / []
This stinks, absolutely / []
disgusting man / []
his house was like a rail way station people coming in and out full of nonces / []
The fact that the person who heckled him will spend more time in jail than he will ever will is disgusting. / ['Well the heckler disrespected the kingdom and there’s word that he will be placed on a terrorist watch list as well.  \n\n#Trump2024', "I don't think he broke the law did he?", '@phineus8397 it is illegal to heckle a royal family member, according to sources online anyway.

And even if they were he’s just exercising rarified cognitive dissonance.']
Sick old man 🤣 / []
Diese Person ist eine Schande! / []
Why would anyone especially someone of his status want to be friends or associated with a known pedophile like epstein? He's obviously never had to be accountable for any of his actions in his life before and now he's been made accountable for them. He paid it all off to keep the girl quiet to keep it from going to court. / []
he doesn’t sound very convincing 😂 / []
What a gross creature he is🤢🤮 / []
And to think his Daughter is sat just near him off camera!! I've never met but here's a cheque for you anyway..pull the other one! / []
That stuttering is unbelievable / []
how on earth did this tool think this was a good interview that would work in his favour / []
🤢🤮🤮🤮 / []
This dude is lyingg!!!!!...and wrong move to speak outtt..did he think it would make things better?? Lol smh / []
If you ever wondered what a dishonest liar looks like, watch this… he’s a sad, sad man… / []
Well that solves it. P. Andrew doesn't sweat............ / []
Body language says your a liar! / []
"Your Royal Lowness, thank you." / []
I’ve watched this video a few times because I’m fascinated by liars. I can’t tell if he’s such a terrible liar because he doesn’t do it very often or if because when you’re royal no one calls you on it. I’m inclined to think the latter if the reports that he believed the interview went very well are true.  Edit: now I can actually tell he had been rehearsing most of this in his bathroom mirror. / ["He's a good liar.  He does it often. He's a sex addict. And sex addicts lie. They lie a lot.", "I think that he's such a terrible liar because he's also an idiot.", 'If you haven’t already, watch the pbs interview with bill gates. A blind man can see how guilty these people are.', "He's a G D Liar", 'I feel like you need to be sort of smart to be a good liar. So that is another possibility, not particularly smart to even pull it off.']
ANDREW HAD 2 DAUGHTERS AT THE TIME, YET HIS DEMEANOR IS HOLLOW AND HEARTLESS OVER THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A PICTURE OF THE ACCUSER WITH HIS ARM AROUND HER, AND HE STILL LIES....

AND TODAY WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDE CHARLES BOUGHT AND GAVE CAMILLA A BRACELET THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS WEDDING TO DIANA ECPOSING HIS AFFAIR WITH CAMILLA NEVER ENDED... / ["Apples and oranges. Charles III's marriage to the former Princess of Wales is history now. People need to let it go. This is collusion with a sex offender and potential sexual assault."]
Liar no doubt a proper investigation would get to bottom of this disgrace even sitting there must think were all idiots / []
Feeling a bit flat today, this video always cheers me up  :) / ['Absolutely']
Retire Prince Andrew.  " You have to understand this is everybody else's fault not mine". / ["His constant use of a 'we' was a deliberate deflection."]
Is this girl 13 or something 🤔 / []
Why are they taking the girls statement for real Just asking 🙄 / []
Wasn't Clinton and Gates friends with Epstein? / ['Yes, Donald Trump as well', '@stantorren4400 thanks 😊']
At 27:49 he says shaking his head up and down that “no, it never happened” 🤢🤦‍♀️  And the way he laughs under scrutiny and making up all the places he WAS at and can remember those!! 😮 / ['He shakes it side to side', 'And specifically up and down once when he first answers.  It’s quickly done.  Analysts always say watch for this when lying.']
Everyone is so cruel with them like if they were saints. All of them committed sins much worse. Camila is the mistress that was so cruel with Diana. Charles  made her suffer a lot. William apparently had an affair. Princess Ann was the mistress of Camila’s ex husband. Prince Andrew committed sex crimes against young girls. What else? Yea / ["Apples and oranges. Andrew's concealment, lying, and settlement are awful. The rest are mostly history."]
‘I couldn’t have bought her drinks. I don’t even know where the bar is at Tramps…’ 🤥 / []
He is a liar / []
The way he answers questions the signs of guilt are so apparent , or to put it another way he is lying. / []
the oddest thing is he laughs every time the mention of epstein dead, first at 38:23, then at  40:35, honestly weird / []
this guy is like a kid in an adult body. the entitlement is unreal. he was completely unprepared for this interview but in his mind, he thinks he was SUPER prepared. / []
Andrew you’re sick old man / []
Going to PIZZA 🍕 express...😄😭😅 / []
Me personally, if I had his expertise at hand… ie the whole British intelligence service. I would just get them to prove my innocence and not go on the news and fuck my own ass and think I got my hole / []
He only remembers going downstairs to the basement… / []
He escaped the charges as he is in a powerful position and he has immense wealth nothing new / []
Disgusting you should allow this at this time. He has lost his mother 😡😡 / ['Lol its been online for a long time', '@Azure3000 I am aware of that fact but they could have restricted its viewing during this time.

He's so gross / []
Epstein dead. Maxwell banged up for 20 years. Andrew still in the public eye. / []
The genius part of this interview is when he denies something happened he is very very certain of it and doubles down on it (e.g. visiting epstien Island 4 times a year) , yet he cannot seem to categorically deny the accusations with the same conviction. The man is clearly lying about his involvement its actually hilarious to watch. / []
Simply disgusting man! His moral compass is non existant. Made it worst as a member of the Royal family. After the funeral Harry and Andrew as well as Meghan should be barred from the family. Get rid of them once and for all! / ['Monarchist moron', 'Monarchist moron']
A cosmopolitan group of paedophiles.. oh I mean eminants...... / []
He is only sorry he got caught / []
I hope everybody realizes why he did this interview, I'll try to keep it short but unfortunately some of us don't for example and I don't mean to bring it up in this comment section but I have to cuz it's the best example, the same people that are organizing a major event let's name all the world leaders involved so far Putin solensky president xi and Biden, I think they should be indicted along with this c*********, but they won't / []
What a nightmare for the people he has left his filthy mark on. He will pay in the end. / []
Is he still sweating? / []
He's such a LIAR...😡😡😡NO wonder The Queen gave up. Eyes face and mouth tell all. Get him out King Charles. / ['Listen here monarchist bootlicker, the reason he isn’t arrested is because of his mother protecting him']
The worst thing Prince Andrew ever did, was not “allegedly” have relations with under age girls, it was giving this interview. Had he not given this interview, there would have been doubt amongst many as to whether or not he was truly involved. After this interview aired, there is simply no doubt he was involved….allegedly of course. / []
12:06 Can't help but laugh, what a dumbass / []
Wow, death of hrh brought me to this, didn't even know it was covered. Why did he think he would get through it.  Because he is too honourable to lie, because he is self entitled,  because he is totally detatched from what reality is, because he thinks he can outwit this brilliant interviewer and public, I'd say all but the first one! He said he felt he felt that discontinuing his friendship with noncy chops the 2nd over the phone was not appropriate and better done face to face, yes that's because what he had to discuss couldn't be said or recorded. He said that he is a patron of the NSPCC,  yes to source damaged children. He said he stayed with paedo Stein in his house for 4 days because it was convenient, of course it was, then he tried denying that photo, but once confronted about it, said it's a photo of a photo of a photo, so he means a photo! He said that he that the photo was taken upstairs but never been upstairs? How does he know what upstairs looks like,  he said when that photo was taken on March the 10th he was at pizza hut or wherever with his daughters,  well I know that the girl said the photo was taken after a night out at tramps nightclub in London,  pizza Express would have been closed up so his alibi is shot down there, funny this IS the only thing he can remember, he said that at that time because he was shot at he couldn't sweat and hasn't been able to since till now, yeah bet he's sweating during it. Sexstein was having sex with at LEAST 3 girls a day so during his 4 day stay he cant remember seeing any in his house, because not wanting to sound grand at the palace theres lots of people coming and going so he thought THEY were staff, what 13 year old girls?He said hes never had sex with children because, as a man that you have to be quite positive to have sex(his words) but squirms then eye blocks not for the first or last time during the interview(means hes very uncomfortable with this line of questioning) then says he asked himself this and cant remember that he did, classic denial syndrome. When she said for the first time JE is dead how do you feel....shock..then she says it again and he laughs...relief!(JE is silenced). He then says that he was shocked that JE acted so unbecoming...she turns round and says unbecoming,  hes a sex offender, and he says yes I'm just being polite, no you just don't want to utter the words noncy balls. Then he says his way of reconnecting with the public is with education(children) and through raise(children's charity for 7 to 14 yr olds)ultimately admitting hes still at at. It all makes up for a complete royal PR meltdown. I have serious concerns about other people within the house. It's just a coincidence that they were best friends with the UKs worst celebrity serial child SO(Jimmy saville) and now so far(I know there's alot bigger) US biggest child SO! Theres definitely a SRA cabal after researching Qanons material and the Adrenochrome theory. I'm making it known to anyone watching that I know nothing of interest!🙄 all I'm saying ahem ahem. / []
Funny this is similar to line of duty, a drama series created by the bbc / []
What a disgrace / []
I believe Prince Andrew never even met her. She needs life imprisonment for victimized an innocent man. She is another Megan Markle / ["If that's the case why couldn't he explain what he was doing in that photo with his hand around her waist. Why couldn't he tell Jeffrey Epestein on the phone that he would have to discontinue their friendship.What a load of nonesense. This interview is enough evidence to suggest that he is a liar.The only way one would side with him would simply be because of their love for the royals.", 'Really? Are you having a wind up? \n\nYou seen all the pictures of her with him and how badly he lied in the interview. How hilarious 😂']
A man who should of known better there is no excuse for him  or  being friends with Epstein how can any one believe in this man   I would think the people would be appalled how the roal family was doing how could any one could look up to them we will remember Epstein and Andrew was friends with epstein the answear should of been yes he regratded his friendship with eostein / []
Andrew had a true military career, fighter pilot, covert missions not like Harry who was kept behind the front lines for fear he be kidnapped by the enemy and cause all kinds of problems.  Andrews daughters are both married with children and they support their father. Now today in 2022 Sept. 17 and Monday is the Queen's funeral. There is a huge argument of who wears what uniform, really. Who cares, Harry, you won't need it anymore, you quit your job. You put your family under the bus. Now you shed tears in grief, HOWEVER you are having another book out next moth to tear your family and your granny apart again. Sorry Harry, NO sympathy from me. I feel much more sorry for Andrew in his situation. / []
You have no recollection because you were pissed and off you head on cocaine / []
And everyone queing up to see the queen after this!!! Discusting!! / []
What was he drinking that night to not remember anything! However he does not remember anything, but he remembers not going upstairs! You see, I don’t even attempt to lie, because I don’t really know how to. He should do the same! / []
The lies makes me cringe / []
This is funny.  Is he saying a prince going out to make buz friends without checking their backgrounds? / []
Well damn he should have never did this interview he just told on himself lol wow / []
How did the bbc allow this when this guy belongs to powers to own this whole cooperation / []
I’m not a fan of the BBC, but the journalism and quality of interview questions here is spectacular! / []
Dirty andrew should be in prison anyone else / []
Its crazy how everyone in the comments is sitting in judgement of this guy. Have you ever fornicated, looked at a bad picture, or commited sexual immorality in your life. Sadly most people would have to answer yes to this. And that makes us guilty like Andrew, if what he is charged with is even true. And that is doubtful given how biased the media is. They hate the royal family to begin with. What is true is the BBC supports the murdering of babies, sexual immorality of all kinds, while pretending they are progressive. The hypocricy here is through the roof. Its actually pretty Hilarious. The BBC should be investigated. I am sure  scandals wont be lacking / ["This is not about sexual immorality. This is about hanging out with a sex trafficer of underage girls, before and after convictions. Andrew himself admitted that and that's the fact. \nI think most of the people never hanged out with sex trafficers. People don't trust Andrew and believe in allegations because how can you trust a guy who hanged out with Epstein after conviction.", "I'm fairly certain the people in the comments have not (and would not) continue a friendship with a convicted sex offender and human trafficker. So they can rightly judge this lizard all they want", 'No, we are not all guilty like Andrew. Fornication is not the same thing as procuring a trafficked teenager for sex.']
Media like BBC support abortion and every filthy thing. You cant take these guys seriously. / ['Pro life moron']
This a classic bust...you could have STFU / []
He started as the party prince and came out the other end the paedo prince / []
Why isn’t he in prison? / []
William better keep princess Charlotte away from this pervert / []
This interview literally was like him digging the grace and jumping into it with no assistance at all.   He said they were not close friends but he stayed at his homes 3 to 4 times a year????   He’s a clown. And obviously thinks he smarter than everyone else.   What foolishness is this? / []
Epstein would of had secret cameras in various places…he knew that he had to dance whenever Epstein called because he was worried sick that something would come out…and probably still is..inner circles know that Andrew was sleeping with many young girls and his death was not a coincidence / []
"It was a convenient place to stay 😲" / ["It's convenient because hotel chains in New York won't hand him over teen girls 🤮"]
If you also look at the colour temperature ajustment, day and night which should time photographs.. you can tell day night etc, in Kelvin, You can tell time of day or night via location. Said arm round person, I reckon at least 4 cameras blended in.. and adjusted. The only way to tell is the original... / []
Speaking as a lighting designer and a cameraman.. of course it was photoshopped together.. all the focusses are different, and if you look closeley, all the shadows from the key light are all in the wrong places! Of course it's a bloody fake! / []
Nope. This is people digging for shit. There is enough breadcrumbs as evidence, in public knowledge to prove that this tramps club story is absolute BS..created by Epstien's somewhat criminal trafficing co-horts.. / []
This is so funny / []
Put him in jail on open hardcore jail without cameras and throw away the keys 🤬😡💩🇸🇯 / []
He just had to go to Epstein and explain why it wasn't a good idea to remain friends because of what the public might think....not because of Epstein's horrid inexcusable behavior but because it would look bad??? And after Epstein's conviction he stayed at Epstein's house for several days because it was convenient, he says. Seems perfectly legit.🙄 . / []
If he was innocent and falsely accused, I thought he would arrange to speak with US authorities and do everything to clear his name.  It would have been cheaper than the money spent giving the accuser all that money and clear his name at the same time. / []
If only Oprah had been so questioning... / []
Your mummy isn't going to bail you out anymore is she / []
He is guilty as sin! Notice his eyes and how he keeps back paddling and making excuses. The Queen was correct in stripping him, even though it was her son! Bless her heart, how this son could disgrace her and the Royal family! 😢 Epstein didn’t commit suicide….he was killed to keep him silent. He had the scoop to make heads roll, people of wealth and status! If you believe he committed suicide, then I have some ocean front property in Arizona for sale! / []
Could all the royals be this stupid?...they actually could be because everything is so rehearsded usually that we never get to see the real person. / []
You can bet the Queen helped in some way to cover this up as well to protect her son. No one in that circle is innocent / []
There’s actually people in these comments having sympathy for him yikes 🤮 / []
I see next to nothing negative about Andrew, but yet hundreds of commenters mostly negative about Megan, this is a ugly picture here. It doesn’t make me like the Royals. I see lies an a lot of snaking around. / []
I know Andrew has been accused of being with a Traffic young girl, witch is evil,!…but why should he get kicked out if Charles an Camilla are not or the Queen the Queen covered for, Charles an Camilla destroying Diana an her Children, they should all be gone. William an Kate should be King an Queen.! / []
" I don't sweat" lmao / []
Pensar que le dieron el listado con las preguntas mucho antes... y todo para que conteste estás pelotudeces? Mejor que diga que tiene Alzhaimer. Un fracaso de entrevista. / []

Would his security details not clear this matter up or fbi files why has British police force not opened their on inquiry ? / []
Why. don’t you shut up Andrew you are a liar I seen you on tv waving good buy and shutting the door .Dont tell me yo didn’t know what was going on .epsteine played you fo a fool .he wanted both of you to be photographed together .as insurance .If you were a friend of galaine maxwell it’s just the same .But you still went again . Those poor girls you abused you are a liar .The queen was disgusted with you . The other s will cover only so much . / []
They are not friends .But great buddies in the states and the uk Andrew even asked Epstein to the uk and Guilaine even Donald trump and loads of celebs were on that island .no questions were asked to the other people .epsteine had hidden cameras every where in the houses even his places  come on do he think we are fools . Where are the tapes loads of sex tapes .andrew must have been bloody blind .😮 / []
Why do we need an interview to confirm he's guilty ? the reality of the world is when you are in power like he is you can get away with everything. Just go to any third world under developed country and see what's going on. People lives are meaning less. Just remember God is watching though. You may live like you are untouchable until cancer strikes or some other disease. / []
He said his tendency to be honorable lol / []
Its amazing how perplexed a liar can try to look. / []
This prince is innocent but the woman who accused him just wants to take money from him, so she accused him with rapist to take money from him. That what happens when you live in feminine community and the feminists have media and their laws. Community must be Masculine again. / ['This is why kids you should stay away from incels and anti-feminists, they like pedophiles and may come for you']
I cant sweat ffs remembers eating pizza don’t remember shagging a minor full family’s rotten to the core she exposed him for what he is a lying dirty toff / ['This prince is innocent but the woman who accused him just wants to take money from him, so she accused him with rapist to take money from him.

This man reportedly paid his accuser some $12million for something that didn't happen (ha ha) and notwithstanding the outstanding reign of Elizabeth II, people still hold the Royal Family in high esteem.

This is crazy, Basically he went to see him (Epstein)to make sure his not going to betray him…. This is crazy he is really guilty. / []

Watching him in the Queens funeral events. You must wonder if he’s feeling ashamed being in the public . He looks so pitiful wonder if he’s sorry / ['Hes a dull human and has no shame', 'I would suppose he’d be experiencing an overwhelming sense of guilt for becoming such a shameful disappointment to his mother in her final years…but somehow I doubt it. \nHe’s is appallingly arrogant and entitled.', "Sorry is not anything this person will be, such fine human sentiment does not dwell in the rather thick self indulged mind of a dullard.\nHe is a pitiful creature with no awareness of others feelings, theres only one person in andy's world.", 'Oh he is sorry alright.

Unbelievable lying. / []

Greatest interview in the history of television / []
I’d love it if he was telling the truth the whole time 🤣 / []
So you cut him off end of 2006 and when he got released in 2010 you book a flight all the way to NYC to go nd tell him you have to cut him off—( and you’ve done it before without any heads up) I think Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual relationship as well) 👀😳 / []
Enjoying lying, when he knows everyone knows he is, clearly a man going through a later mid-life crisis just to get attention. That's a man who regrets his younger life. / []
Here after his mothers death to understand why he’s no longer considered a 🤴 Royal    Trying to understand these ppl 😔 / []
The part that I can’t get over is how he NOT ONCE expresses any compassion for the victims of the sex trafficking, or disgust/revulsion at the whole idea. He just keeps saying he “can’t recall” or he “categorically denies,” as if he’s in court or giving a deposition. This BBC interview was his chance to show any sort of human side he might have by expressing empathy for the victims - and he doesn’t. / ['Not showing any empathy for the victims of the sex trade does not make him guilty.', "That's a narcissist at work.", "@nicholasjohnferriman8283 doesn't help his looks and facts of his situation either", 'Maybe because he is top engaged in keeping Up appearances and act like he is altogether a trustworthy person who is telling the truth and It never ever crossed his mind that we can see through him.', 'Clearly involved and enjoyed it']

ANDREW, YOU'RE A SICK, OLD MAN !! / []
Okay, to all you geniuses commenting on this: I will at least be humble to say out loud, "I wasn't there", so here is the question: Did anyone actually SEE Andrew having sex with this girl? I mean, you can't sue a dead man, but the royal family seems like an EASY target. Come on, there has to be a taker on the question out there. I didn't follow this closely, so I will say I don't know. Unlike you all that seem to know for a fact what has happened. / []
I have to say something is fishy here slot of stuttering a lot of over talking and the constant shaking of the head I don’t know Andrew some this ain’t the truth here. / []
If a police man ever came to door hopefully the constable would have kicked our behind, but he will do worse,ok dad I promise, need that old school back again Mr G s McGovern / []
Him that better make it a begging plea with tears running down his face,his nose bubbling,pleas of promoting me that he will never ever shout, swearing, trying to bring a person down again,we'll I'm going to leave a dvd online recording camera to tell him everyone in Scotland,all over world will see him being humiliated,and if I see online that he is being honest I will then tell him that he was never tied up, clothing a hand away,fish and chip shop next door, paid so it's free,give him map and he is only 100 yds away what a fool he would be then,weii done the 2 men in crowd for pulling him away,and the constable police Scotland for handcuffing him away, what happened to parents who from old school taught us to respect our elders, people of authority,and respect police,who told me / []
And I'm very glad that the respectful 2men grabbed that thick Scottish guy or thug kind of boy that likes bullying younger teens,as I myself being ex special forces soldier I think I would have taken him to the alley,tied him up taken to a bunker underground , only a few of ourselves know where,ordered him to strip while crying like a kid, chain him to the metal surrounding, tell him has he got a message to the people he tried to humiliate,then tell hi / []
I’m sorry, but there, s Guilt written all over his face, 🙈😅if he knew what the guy was about and yet decided to go on a walkabout to tell him they no longer need to see each other, omw!!! Such bull and he’s a liar!!and still stutters to say that he wasn’t invited to he’s release party, and still can’t remember getting a foot massage from a Russian girl from a renowned source!! Oh come on Andrew!!😳hats off to the presenter, he was sweating under his collar!! / []
Who's back after the death of our Late Queen Mother,  😂 lets see how it goes / []

So much blinking, stammering, flinching. A predator AND a crappy liar. / []
This is an excellent example of "sometimes is much better not to say anything" that make it worst. / []
Really weird how he expressed no condolences or remorse for the victims of Epstein (even though he was a predator to one of the victims, it was weird how he didn't even attempt to send out any words of sympathy for them.) Says a lot about the kind of person that he is. / ['True', 'Bring back hanging.', 'Maybe he had a reason not to feel remorse. Im not saying he is not guilty but still there will always be 2 stories to tell. I believe the sex was consensual. At 17 to meet a prince is huge and she doesnt look that innocent to me. They are both guilty maybe not equally but she has her part of guilty for sure. Why taking the money? Why being quiet so long time? Why smilling in the pictures next to the man you despise?too many questions', '@andreeaalexandra9058 Your centrist way of viewing things is extremely stupid and detrimental', '@andreeaalexandra9058 if a person under the age of 18 wants to have sex with someone much older, in a position of immense power such as Prince, it is still not consensual due to the power imbalance of their ages and positions. If a child wants to have sex with an adult It is not consensual.']
The interview that ruined Prince Andrew's reputation. / []
The Queen was exemplary throughout her seventy years on the throne. Andrew throughout his tenure as a working Royal was the opposite. A disgusting person, long may he be kept well out of sight. / []

The legal age of consent in the UK is 16 so legally he had done nothing wrong by our laws unless he knowingly knew she was trafficked.

The fact that he did showed he was complicit in other illegal activities"]
This interview aged like fine wine, put that pig in prison / []
This interview is shadowbanned too. When you look up “prince andrew scandal BBC” its nearly at the bottom of the page even given its view count. Way to go YouTube! / ['Ummm it popped up at the very top when I searched it.', '@calisongbirdno it didnt leftard and it hasnt for hundreds of millions of people']
Andrew couldn’t have called, emailed, sent someone else to tell Epstein the friendship was over? Sure. He was a convicted sex offender, he didn’t deserve any extra courtesy.  Also telling how Andrew frames it as “we can’t be friends because it makes me look bad” as if that’s the real problem! / []
Why is everyone fawning over the interviewer? Sure she asks tough questions, but she never pushes back on his BS. She just moves onto the next question. / []
Once a person you have been associating with is accused of these atrocious crimes and behaviour and you become aware of them you keep far far away in every aspect and not be tempted in anyway to ever been seen with such an individual unless there's something you feel is well worth you risking your reputatiation, humiliating your family, friends and in Prince Andrews case a whole nation. This is totally unacceptable and how absolutely embarrassing for the Queen, the Royal Family and the nation.  I suppose everyone is responsible for their own actions and no one else can get the blaim yet our Majesty the Queen was wonderful with all said and done she was able to stand up head held high to duty, dedication and love for her country always winning the admiration of millions allover the world whatever scandal showed its ugly face.  Did he forget he had two girls of his own to set the best example, how selfish of him. / ['Yes she held her head up high as she ripped off the poorest people in Britain through Bright House', 'Its kind of similar to his great great great uncle dirty Bertie before he became Edward VII eh?', 'Predators have family and children to deflect that they are predators, look at ted bundy he had a partner that didn\'t know he was a serial killer, good cover for their sick crimes! People still fall for it, because the family unit and having a family is meant to be what "we should do" to be a good/sucessful person...', "@fxhzwingzero You are SO right dude!  You know what really irks ME?  People and the cops always look and point fingers at the guy who acts differently than most.  Or is a bachelor.  Or may appear 'weird' to others.  When in reality, most of them are good upstanding citizens.  Its the really popular coaches, teachers, community leaders, team doctors,  beloved fathers, etc. that always seem to be the ones who commit these acts!  But society wouldn't even CONSIDER them! Because they simply have a 'stereotype' in their head rather than knowing what statistics prove!", 'I disagree with you on the Queen. She knew fine well what a lecturous Randy sod he was and protected him. She spoiled him rotten and he was her favourite son. A pedophile who probably did some atrocious things to many a girl over the decades. The Queen be damned and all of these parasites.']
He is far from being honourable man . / []
He's clearly telling the truth. I don't know why people given him such a hard time. This Virginia Roberts woman is lying for whatever reason only God knows, and she will have to stand account before God on what's she done to Prince Andrew. Why Andrew settled with her out of court is probably because he's a coward not because he was involved in such a scandal that was clearly made up by this strange Virginia woman. / ["Ah yes, I'm sure Epstein and Maxwell also are innocent too..."]
He never went into depth what I was doing Ah ah I mean what he was doing…Case closed. / []
Good interview - would that someone would interview both Trump and Clinton with the same level of persistence. / []

Liar / []
Prince Andrew has credible allegations. But he was a good son to his mom.  And because of his corrupt family, we’ll never know the truth. / []
He is a liar / []
His mother is away now having done her duty. After rewatching this interview i can't help but hope that he is stripped of ALL his royal privilege and titles. This interview is truly dark. The bullshit he serves up as  excuses for all his behaviour is appalling. He also never had to defend this nonsense in court ,which anyone else would have had to do. He protection always came from who his mother was and his titles. #ENOUGH. / []
Prince Andrew you sick old man / []
here for top royal content / []
“He was able to bring a lot of “extraordinary” people together.” This interview is chilling to watch. / ['Give us some names of these extraordinary people,maybe a few more criminals.', 'Donald Trump, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton among others, some of the most elite men on the planet', '"Extraordinary" = Pedos 🤣', 'Some of those "extraordinary" people were paying Epstein good money to have sexual congress with underaged girls.', '@johnthomson2164000']
Who cares? Jeffrey Epstein's dead. He committed suicide for hanging himself in prison. And I will help Prince Andrew. He was under bad influence. He needs to trust God and help heal him for his mercy. / ['lol', '@michaeltrue6202 Cut it out. This is truth.', 'God ain’t real']
He is a disgrace to the family. He is unpleasant. A man who participates in the abuse of women for Prostitution is a monster without moral values. He’s disgusting. / []
Nothing screams GUILTY like this interview. I can’t recall ever hearing someone stutter & stumble so much. It’s also telling how he doesn’t make mention of the victims of sex trafficking & how appalling it is. Another no brainer… if you tell a convicted felon you can no longer be acquainted with them you wouldn’t pick the most public place in NY to do that… Central Park. Really!? He mistakes us ‘commoners’ for fools. / ['Body language is notably unreliable for determining guilt.', '@nicholasjohnferriman8283 everything about this interview indicates he\'s guilty. "I couldn\'t have been sweating I can\'t sweat", "I couldn\'t have had sex with that trafficked minor, I was at pizza express in woking". Everything he said was a lie, and not a good one.']
Just watching this and wondering why there weren't more cases brought up.from Epstein's black book... How the fuck was Prince Andrew the one of the only ones to be brought down by this / []
I believed him right up until he admitted to seeing Epstein after he was convicted to “end the friendship”. You’re the Prince of England. You don’t need to go visit anybody. / []
There’s no good time to talk about it…. But now we’re talking about , 😱 I never really paaarty but I was single for a veeeery looong time…….

A lot of parallels here between Andrew and Ted Bundy, men who knew full well they were guilty of horrendous crimes but were so arrogant and narcissistic that they decided to defend themselves in the public eye fully believing that they were so much smarter than everyone else that it would simply be but a mere inconvenience and the “peasants” will eat it up……..didn’t work out well for either of them did it. / []

Are we assuming and convinced that all the accusations levelled at him come from people who are being completely truthful ? And come from those with pure unblemished character ? Studiobinder has just released the "Rashomon effect" a short and riveting doc on You Tube. May well apply here undoubtedly. Take a look, its worth it. / ['Why the payoff?']
He is an arrogant, smug, self-centered, egotistical joke!  I hope King Charles will keep this fool at a great distance.  He's a disgrace!!  What the hell is the difference if he had Epstein as a guest for a party or a shooting weekend?  The fact of the matter is he socialized with a known pedophile and invited him into his homes.  And he in turn stayed at Epstein's home - he knew what Epstein was and he still chose to pursue a friendship.    Liar, Liar, Andrew's pants are on fire! / []
This guys the king now…. / ['THE KING ANDREW', 'You mean King Charles III, not Andrew']

Pathetic / []
It's honestly astounding how many times he does the "contradicts evidence by admitting guilt" gag. "I wasn't wearing those clothes when I raped her!" / []
"As soon as somebody reminded me of it I went, oh yeah, I remember that." Genius. / []
His reaction to his friend raping a child is "This damages my image." / []
Ah yes, the magical sweating problem which only applies in the one time in your life it really matters, magically, when you fuck kids. / []
Awesome! No heritage for him! / []
Prince Andrew is Don of Queen Elizaberh ll. Nuff typed. / ['Ah yes, the don of Queen Elizaberh']
Don't think for one minute that the interviewer wasn't in on this. / []
He didn't know what was going on.      Lying. Like. A. Rug. / []
Ssssserpent talk. / []
.maybe I'm naive but she wasnt underage, she knew what she was doing. She wanted the lifestyle  and the perks.  Now she just wants a mega payout 18 or 19yrs later. I'm not defending Prince Andrew, but she knew what she was doing / ['Definitely naive.', 'Naive as hell. She was sex trafficked... abused and taken advantage of by men in power. Even if she was "of age", it\'s an abuse of power. This is just one girl too, who knows who else Prince Andrew raped during his many years of being friends with Ghislane + Epstein.']
Andrew you aren't invited to the funeral,  sorry mate there will be too many kids . OK? / []
Oh yea Andrew sure likes to use the word "stretch" / []
This shows that hes more naive than guilty. Its not obvious that hes guilty however he does seem naive and easy to set up by others. / ['No, he’s guilty, he’s afraid of being persecuted']
Hmm, how does he know it's the second floor of Maxwell's house if he says he had never been up there? 🤔 / []
My God, this man has the look of a CREEP! / []
This is so uncomfortable to watch. I have to keep pausing lol / []
Gary glitter must be pretty pissed of he wasn't a royal / []
Great timing youtu.be / []
He escorted Queen Elixabeth in the Prince funeral they accept all the nasty things / []
The funniest interview in history / []
At the 2:05 mark he describes to the scope of the pedophile ring. Wake up, the people running this world are wicked pedophiles including his brother Charles who was best of friends with Jimmy Savile. / []
He’s lying thru his teeth. / []
Embarassing to watch. / []
This dude is lying thru his teeth. He needs to be right next to Epstein. / []
Body language speaks volumes... / []
This is one of the most bizarre things ive ever seen😂😂 ppl are either to poor and trying to survive to worry about this or too rich and wanna stay that way so they just mind their business 😂😂 / []
Jeff and Andrew ....well it is fair to Say Elisabeth fiering Andrew started to fight back drugs Sinaloa and Even very very late became a true 1776 patriot.puting Charles the third makes it more easy .GOD save the king... / []
I remember seeing him in Boston. I didn’t realize he was a diddler. / []
What has he suffered consequentially after interview? Does anyone know? / ['Stripped of all military titles, no longer HRH and let go from all charity work. He paid 12 million to the victim rather than sit for deposition (taxpayer money).']
All the shit surrounding Meghan and her being half black being a problem for the royal family is a distraction. You and the entire media have thrown her and Harry under the bus. Andrew, you’re imbedded in this system and you know exactly what’s going on. The real story is you being a sexual predator. / ['Completely agree!! Well said 👍', 'Meghan is still a narcissist.', 'She was no saint money grabbing ho put money she threw herself at him.\n\nIf she wanted to nail him and destroy him in court why accept a pay off?\n\nShe just wanted money like most do we know they all gold diggers']
F*ck this guy. I’m just glad the girls who were abused and trafficked are telling their story and being believed and given the chance to have their stories corroborated and listened to and investigated. If you’re asking “why these girls?” It’s because they were vulnerable and predators know exactly what they’re doing. It’s horrifying. / ["Please most of them.probably threw themselves at him now acting like victims because they need money. I don't even like Andrew but let's not act these women are saints."]
The rightful heir / ['No.']
“My tendency to be too honorable” I’ll say it’s pretty dishonorable to keep known sex offender pedophiles as friends, but that’s just me. This guy is full on delusional. And insufferable. / []
one strange creepy family / ['I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels this way']
Pompous, insufferable snob Andrew can't hide behind Mummy's skirts now. May our Queen rest in peace. / []
Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies / []
He should have gone to prison / []
Did we learn anything from this interview other than Andrew has no memory. / []
Bless Andrew's heart for having no memory! Stupid idiot! / []
It was the polite thing to do for me to go in person to tell him I couldn't see him anymore and I stayed several days to comfort him with the news! Lol / ['"Andrew, you\'re a sick old man!"\n😂', 'And because I no longer wanted to be seen with him, we went for a stroll in Central Park so I could tell him so 🙈🙈🙈🙈']
I NEVER DID ANYTHING! I DIDN'T SWEAT, I HAD A MEDICAL PROBLEM, I DON'T RECALL / []
No, I don't recall, I don't sweat, I don't recall, no, no, never happened that I recall, it was convenient, / []
Prince NO Memory! Lol / []
Sad to be a prince with NO MEMORY! LOL / []
Does anyone remember the exact day they got pizza almost 20 years ago? / ['They do if you know the real meaning of pizza.']
The Queen has died today who will protect Andrew? / []
RIP the queen / []
All schools will be closed in Scotland tomorrow. Not because the Queen has died, but because Andrew has arrived. / ['👍🤣']
How many years is he serving? He needs 10 more!! / []
Please tell us more, Prince Andy. Mummy can't fix this can she? God have mercy on your soul. You sick pedophile. / []
I'm only half way in and this is already the funniest interview I've ever seen lol, the look on his face, like a mixture of regret and a boy about to cry cuz mom is angry and then his absolutely lame ass excuses lmao  props to the lady, she's asking several good questions at a proper pace, giving him enough time to shake his head even more lmao she's leading him right up to his own execution and he's helping her along the way while saying no. when I came here I didn't expect this level of entertainment, pure gold. you can't fool karma / []
Its often stated that strong eye contact is a sign of integrity. However, this is actually untrue. Strong forced eye contact is a sign of a liar. / []
Wrong decision, because YOU got caught. You know if he's involved, there's many more of these men out there. Erskine had a lot of friends with that woman. He was kill so it wouldn't go to court. Any body can see that!  And who has the little black book? He went to see him for what reason?? To get that book, because Ep. Had been brought up on charges. That book is gone from the USA. oh well,we'll never know who else these guys "PARTYED" with. Lol / []
Makes me embarrassed to be British how is it us Brits have to pay for this dick / []
And unknown to camera crew etc he brought his daughter along and she is sat very close to him just out of camera view. / []
Andrew has my sympathy. He made a terrible mistake ever getting involved with Jeffrey Epstein. All Virginia had to do was spend all of these years crying crocodile tears knowing that in Andrew's position, there was a payout coming. Now that she's been paid, you won't hear another peep  out of her. / []
The entire royal family needs assassinated. They all are complete trash and deserve any and all bad things that happen to them. / []
Guilty as fuck / []
40:33 - the way he reacts when Emily says “Epstein is dead”, lol / creepy, I sensed relief 🥲 / []
A self-destruction in real-time… it’s like a true crime confession / []
oh my goodness hook this guy up to a lie detector itll go crazy / []
Did he not say at the beginning of the interview that him and Ghislaine were not good friends and then at the end of the interview he talks about how they’re friends…. 🧐 / []
“You have to understand”  ummmmmm no I don’t lol / []
a 4 day dinner party if the bloke was partyin and sleeping with kids what was this man doing locking himself in the bedroom and not been a part of it i would ravor sleep in the ally / []
this man prob has a barriater in another room with a litle rod tapping on his lwg saying yes no or dont answer ...iff i murderd aum1 tmoz the barrister would say rite did u do it i could say yes ans there job is 2 tey make me look not guilty by wat eva means but then again its thr prosicutions job even if u was not guilty ita there job 2 find u guilty and i no the world is a sick place and ive just sat with my friend explaining how normal we are cos the things ppl are upto is just crazy sat outside a pizza shop ans a old man could hardly walk getting in his car revving up the road we was trying to get him out but he drove off then 5 days ago a pist up man on a superbike crashed and his elbow was all bent and he was tryna get bk on and i said dont do it he said its my bike leav me along drunk as hell he was on on drugs i said ok but the 3 women stood and made him look at his arm ..even that 2 me is crazy but staying 9ver at nonces houses is prob as far out as a peraon could go... / []
Holy fuck that is the guiltiest dude I ever seen. PS: WHY DID THEY PAN AWAY? "Epstein is dead..(loud snort, laugh) "Yes".  I want to see this face at that moment. come on.... that is the strangest reaction to someone saying your old friend/acquaintance is dead...like no one on Earth has ever made that sound when someone says their friend is dead. / []
Thinking that he got away with it was the biggest joke of thia piece. / []
18:13 He was in and out all over the place , wow what a poor choice of words. And “it was out of sheer convenience”. Whhhat? You’re the Queen’s son, a prince! People have been making time for you all your life. This makes zero sense. / []
I love watching this leach squirm.  GUILTY. I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the royal houses. This is just the tip of the iceberg. They're all weird. "What happens after this.......?" "I'm going to pay out a shit load of money, be stripped of all royal duties, be stripped of all HRH titles and be universality mocked because of this sham of an interview. I'm just glad I avoided prison but hey I'm a royal and that was never going to happen. BUT it's not an admission of guilt".  Lol. / []
This will be used in the future as part of lying studies.  How is he still free? / []
The fact the British media hounds Meghan when this guy did what he did unbelievable / ['She is absolutely vile and attacks the elderly and children.', 'Difference is Meghan is a professional actor.', "@Emma-dv2yh nah difference is she's not 100% white and the queen didn't pay the media off", "Yes to this, how dare they give meghan stick when this rat didn't get a day in jail for what he done. Make ya sick 😮"]
What an extraordinarily bad liar Randy Andy is. His security detail would have looked into whomever Prince Andrew met with.at home & abroad and  counciled P. Andrew appropriately. He chose to be Randy Andy. / []
Why do royalty noncy peedos get special attention? / []
The thick of it - Royal edition :) / []
Perhaps he will get a real job now🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
What Does he do ????????? / []
This interview will be used for years to come, a masterclass in how PR goes terribly wrong.  Those poor women.. / ['Y’all must be nórmese if you think this was MasterClass. She never asks any emergent questions and almost seems to stick to a pre approved list, so much so she can’t ask an evolution of it but has to repeat his own words back to him hmmm 🤔']
Something very off with his mannerisms, his tone, his communication… / []
There will be justice when all these people connected to Epstein get arrested. People like to link Biden to him but forget trump also travelled with Epstein as well. The whole system is tightly connected with this guy, no wonders he was killed or killed himself taking so much shit with him. We shall not let political movements use the “oh the democrats are linked to sex offenders” like shown on The Boys, because both sides are rotten. Just terrible / []
I watch this every so often and still can’t believe what a train wreck this interview is lol / []
What a load of bullshit Andrew 🤮 / []
He makes me sick. Unbelievable status pffff he is one sick person yes money helps you. But please what a liar 🤮 you do not belong in The Royal Family. One sick man / []
guilty / []
Full of💩 / []
Liar liar liar / []
He’s so full of s***! / []
Word salad. / []
He is absolutely dumb as a post but thinks he is quite brilliant / []
How would one recognise that the photo was taken upstairs in Gelaines house if he claims he had never been upstairs , honestly, a good lawyer would run rings around his lies.  no wonder his legal team who obviously conceded and ordered the tax payer to bail him out. / []
This man should never be let back into royal life, in fact why as a tax payer am I, and everyone else keeping him in royal houses, kick his arse out and tell him to get on with it, no one who was not guilty would pay anyone off, you would fight till you had no fight left ! / []
Prince Andrew, more chance being a Smack Dealer, He made a fool of Our Royal Family, Charles probably not interested in his verbal diarrhea the Duke is a Silly man he knew the Rules. I'm finished. / []
Lier Lier pants of fire 🔥small Child can lie better than this goof, his so bad at it / []
the white R kelly / []
👀 / []
21:30 Be honest you all came here just for this / []
I believe you HRH Prince Andrew! / []
Just breathe! / []
I believe HRH Prince Andrew, I believe the you were lied on and taken advantage of, people are desperate for money, and they will do all kinds of sordid things to get it, this too shall pass! / []
They ‘met each other in the passage’ at Epstein’s house. Yeah, exactly whose ‘passage’ though Andy? / []
He should be in jail / []
A am a aa , bad english. Poor upbringing.  . / []
I'm disgusted with this. All the crimes that members of the royal family have done, and just because they have so much money and power they can do whatever they want with no repercussions / ['Well said! ❤', "Yea well DON'T be disgusted.  She was offered the opportunity by the U.S. Attorney's office to file a criminal complaint against Andrew but she refused.  Prince or no Prince, had she done so, Andrew would have had to come to New York City to answer the charges.  Instead, she sued in civil court because she wanted the money!", '@retroguy9494 I don\'t think this arrangement was only because the money, imagine you have been rap3d by one of the most powerful men in the world, who is not only on his own, but represents one of the most powerful entities in the world. Do you think they will offer you money for your silence begging you for forgiveness? NOOOO. They come with two options." Either you accept the money or we will make sure you suffer more than what you already have"".. So don\'t be naive retroguy94']
Why is he still Not arrested..... this interview is everything 🙌 / ['True why isn’t he in jail', 'no recollection..']
“4 times a year “ absolutely NOT ! This got me bussing uppppp / []
Let’s be honest . He’s the queens son and her favourite son at that so he wouldn’t ever ever go jail / []
The fact that he laughs is disturbing to me / []
Of course he would say that pic of them in the park he was telling him “I no longer want to be seen with you “ damn liar !!!! / []
The interviewer has an amazing soothing voice shiddddd I would confess all my sins to her ! She’s amazing / ['Almost hypnotic. BBC govt owned actress. Wake up. They were reporting the third tower fell on 9// before it ever came down lmao']
His face just looks guilty ! Tf / []
This is the first time I've seen this interview in its entirety. No doubt at all the Duke comes across as less than candid and elusive. Ms Maitlis does a good job overall, but she comes across as a bit biased at times. This is particularly evident with her line of questioning about his alleged contacts with Virginia Roberts. She just keeps rephrasing and asking the same questions over and over again ad nauseam. There comes a point in time when you just have to accept the interviewee's answer and move on. / []
Andrew is blinking like a lying sweaty n0nce he is. So the UK tax payers bailed him of £12 million out of the civil charges he didnt want to take because there was mountain of evidence from witnesses of him and naked young girls on the Pedo island / []
His majesty prince pedophile. When his mommy reinstated his royal privileges were I surprised?. Not at all / []
“That photograph is not a photograph” / []
Andy just how deep do you want your own grave dug????????¿!!!!! / []
god is dead and every entity is mortal. cameras can be bypassed or frozen. / []
He's such a bad liar.  You would think the 'royals' would have expert training on how to lie since they do it all of the time. / []
He spends so much energy into lying. It must be hard. / []
ur done andrew ur fcken done. pedu / []
Why doesn’t he have his teeth fixed? / []
If this was a very loose friendship why feel the need to go and “break up” with this friend? Can’t he afford to stay at a  hotel, there are quite a few of those in NYC, in all parts of the city. / []
KING!!!!! 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑🤟🤟🤟🤟❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥 / []
It's dead his hand around her waist he is a dirty perverted old sad excuse of a man / ['Your just jealous 😆.']

He doesn't drink he was in the navy they have a heavy drinking culture / []
How convenient that he doesn't remember / []
I feel so sorry for the queen  no mother she have to listen to a son make such a fool of hmself / []
Just a disgusting human being. / []
Its like a weasel trying to get out of a trap FOR SURE!!! / []
I know this is old news. But, any criminology professor could read this guys lying eyes. What a good bullshitter / ['Go watch The Behavior Panel’s analysis of this interview on YouTube. It’s brilliant 🤣']
Did handy Andy realize it was his last day having "a walk in the park " 🤣🤣🤣 / []
Not a close friend, already didn't speak to him for 4 years, but still felt the need to "sever ties" in person?? / ["Fanny on my face even if that were the case, would you really need to cut ties with someone who you hadn't spoken to in 4 years."]
Great pimp was he? His incredible ability to bring people "together" at dinner parties and so forth? / []
This same broadcast told the workd about MJ beu g a child molster! Not true!! Shut up stop w the bullshit! / []
Pizza express in Woking? Mate you gotta be joking. / []
Pathetic..... / []
Those girls were there voluntarily.  Virginia went back 3 times, and flew out to the exotic island.  If I was caught out once in this situation, I would not go back again.  She was not a child, 17 is old enough to refuse. The dark haired one said she knew Epstein wanted a massage (!), and even if it was more than she anticipated, WHY GO BACK???   No time for this, I am afraid.  Even if Andrew did take part (and why would a prince need to pay for sex, there would be LOADS OF WOMEN WHO WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM) it would not mean the girls were not compliant. / ['It looks all the  accusers are saints and have never sinned, what a wonderful world it could be if that were true, 🕊confession would not be needed, no fines,no praying and  everyone one of us would be Children of God, it’s a dream I have, 🧚🏻 We all sin🙀 Thank God  he forgives us all, no matter what religion we are, as far as I know, we all have red blood, I can’t guarantee that.

Ha Ha- I call B.S. / []

This was SO PAINFUL to watch he looked so uncomfortable Because Deep Down he Knows EXSACTLY what he did.🤣 his Answers were ridiculously weak. COME ON who would believe anything hes saying?? its not just his words its the way hes shifting around  on his seat to *CRINDGE* / []

Private boy schools, too much money, posh family names, aristocracy - all of those things breeds nepotism and pervert behaviors. Look at Epstein himself, Trump, Weinstein… it’s all about men with real power, inherited power and way too much money. Disgusting! / []
He is a liar!  Furthermore, Diana said the entire Royal Family was NOT HUMAN!  That would explain the smell that Virginia said he emitted.  It has been widely stated that the Royal Family is REPTILIAN!  When are people going to wake up and take what Diana and others have said?  I also have always believed it exceedingly crazy to keep providing for this uppity, useless family.  There needs to be an end to this ridiculous catering to them.  They do nothing except represent the old ways when citizens, especially the poor bowed down to this monstrosity.  I am an American and give nothing to them, but they should not rule over anyone. / []
The more he talks, the bigger the hole he digs.  Let’s not forget he was probably f***ing GM  at Uni  What an ignorant pig. / []
His body language tells everything that idiot is lying. He should go to jail… / []

He seems like such a creep! Also doesn't seem like the brigthest light. Did he really think none of this would ever come out? Easy to tell he is lying. / []
He is a pervert and child predator nor shocking what's shocking is he was allowed to do it / []
My goodness, this never gets old / ['I know right.', '@John Edwards she did now though']
Prince Andrew, you are shameful.  You do not have any sort of dignity. To sit there and lie with such a straight face, the queen must be so proud. / []
why does this go on and on his mother paid the money the girl dropped the chargers why do we have to have all this sex filth keep coming up about these warped people / []

"It was a convenient place to stay" says a man who has access to numerous Palaces he can stay literally as well other lavish properties around the world and we're to believe he at all thinks of a place from a known pedophile as convenient? What could be more convenient then staying at one of the kingdoms that you are a accompany to? "Epstien was not a bad party indeed" / []
Interviewer: Why sleep over in a pedophile home?  Prince Andrew: twas a convenient place for a prince to stay, coz travel lodge and plaza up the road had no vacancy.

I think his disproportionate sense of morality and reality, was his downfall.   From the moment he begins speaking, he seems to either intentionally or unintentionally not observe the severity of why the interview is taking place.   He was trying so hard to engage in conversation with Emily, that he felt would put her at ease and reduce the uncomfortable line of questioning that she ultimately took.   His privilege, entitlement and immorality made the perfect combination for this interview to be revered as one of the most damning in modern history. / []
An arrogant denier of reality. / []
Where is Billy Clinton oh that’s right the FBI is kind of keeping him safe I’ve never had sexual relations with that woman right Billy / []
What a disgrace / []
What utter rubbish your a self important arrogant beast. You say you had no contact for 4 years then found the need to go see him to tell him you wanted no contact?  Tell the truth your a beast and you went there stayed with him had a dinner party.  Do you really think we are all stupid. / []
No recollection of the photo being taken but he knows for sure it was taken upstairs....hmmmmm, I smell bullcrap / []
NONSH / []
If he wasn’t under investigation, you would’ve contacted abusing underage girls.  Right!? / []
Prince Andrew, your royal highness, Sir, did it ever occur to you that no amount of money can buy a person’s life or erase the abuse they were subjected too.  You shouldn’t have stayed at that place no matter how convenient it was and also you should’ve have got the pervert arrested.  You have daughters, young at the time.  How would you’ve reacted if they were abused by perverts?  It’s heart breaking to hear what those girls who were abused have been through.  Try to do something about it to stop child abuse and under age sex.  Palming off a fist full of dollars isn’t going to wash away the dirty memories.  You had the power to stop, but you didn’t. / []
how does hrh move, on simple he puts is hand in his pocket and buys her silence and hopes everyone forgets! / []
the woman just seems to be one of the latest breed of american scammers after money,not saying he is 100% inocent but nor is she by a long shot,seen her fake tears on interviews his alledged victim is 300% fake! / ['OK n0nce defender']

who's back here after reading Tina Brown's Palace Papers / []
The Royal Family = royal sleaze. Charles and Camilla used Diana as a breeding mare. After Diana produced an heir, they destroyed her. Charles sashays around town with a briefcase stuffed with Arab oil money, including millions from the Bin Ladens. Harry, a spoiled brat, fabricates stories out of school, and he was dumb enough to fall for gold digger Megan.  William has zero charisma. His trip to the Bahamas was a fiasco. Prince Andrew was going to trial for illicit sex, but he bought his way out of the lawsuit. The poor boy had to sell the chalet in Switzerland and ask Mum for some dough to pay off the accuser. Andrew, when asked why he stayed at Epstein's house, replied, "It was a convenient place to stay." Convenient if you want to sexually abuse underage girls. A family to be proud of?  I’m sick and tired of the vulgar melodrama of the Royal Family. / []
An entitled, aloof, inmoral human being / []
A Joe the Plumber would be in prison. Shame on this guy. / []
He keeps using Ghislaine as a scapegoat ‘I was her friend, I was inviting her’ all instead of Epstein, and now it’s been revealed she helped Epstein lollll / []
Man showed ZERO empathy to victims besides himself whom he is pretending to be a victim. What a lowest form of life. / []
Notice at 12:41 he licks his lips as if he’s trying to wash away any sense of guilt he has. / []
How are there still monarchs in the world? You should have given these creeps the Robespierre treatment long ago. / []
I only caught two or three sound bites of this at the time and have just watched the whole thing now. Astonishing viewing! Literally EVERY word and breath tgst stumbles out of his self-righteous, entitled, “honourable” mouth is another shovel deeper, another suicidal punchline. What a VILE excuse for a human being he is. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qDBLIRPHPzc / []
Crazy how the Royal family keeps attacking Meghan yet so quite about a sex offender in their ranks. LOL. Yeah, never trusting the British Royal Family again. / ["Who's the sex offender you refer to?"]
When asked was the girl lying he didn’t say no,he just said he didn’t remember…….guilty as hell…..any legit person would of answered NO……and he didn’t say yes or no….. / []
This is so comical when it really shouldn’t be that way…..ffs what was he thinking…….. / []
a very unconvincing "performance" from a soft interview.  He is lucky the FBI couldn't get hold of him / []
When  rope tightens around a neck there`s a theory that truth will out. This is true for most of us. But a senior member of our Royal Family is no representatinon of most of us. / []

You were staying at a sex offenders house , andrews reply, it was a convenient place to stay.... Unbelievable / []
Why was it so vital for him to see a child sex offender why would anyone owe him any explanation? Unless he clearly wanted epstein to keep his mouth shut his excuses for been around Epstein are pathetic because of his girlfriend what's his girlfriend  got to do with it?? Nothing he's  saying makes sense for someone like him to need to explain about a low life like Epstein he's obviously guilty as hell!!! / []
He's displaying all the signs of a liar. / []
bet you any money he got a island as well somewhere.  he just learnt off the best as far as he is concern.  mark my words, this sick man is still doing all these things... / []
Lets go on with our lives, its 12 years ago and meanwhile we know how the self-appointed elite is and are coming away with it.  Guess how manny films they made from these elite, Cia blackmail or WEF? / []
Is he filmed by Epstein, like all the others? A good reason to get rid of Epstein? / []
Cosmopolitan pedophiles ? / []
I don't think I ever went upstairs .. 🤣🤣🤣 / []
Pervert! / []
This is precisely why the monarchy must go, to have UNELECTED officials who represent the British image and public (if not officially then unofficially through their unearned privileges, titles and incomes derived from the state) 'pick and choose' their morals while amongst American billionaires is nothing but a disgrace and travesty to the British public.  Even if you personally support the royals, atleast have the decency and self-awareness to strip them of their unearned LEGAL authority, keep them as private citizens and then fall over yourselves worshipping them, but as long as they hold legal power through their privileges and diplomatic immunity (to the point where police can't even enter Prince Andrew's castle to arrest him and book him through the normal legal process we humans in the West are used to) then they will NEVER face any consequences, even tentatively.  This is a disgrace to Britain, no matter how you try to argue how this 70-year old sniveling boy doesn't represent your country, in the eyes of the law he is not only better than you, but entitled to a lifelong pension funded by the British citizens and taxpayers. In fact- why am I saying citizen? Citizens belong to democracies, you are a SUBJECT; not a citizen.  I'm not advocating for revolution, I'm not saying America's system is better or more liberating, but atleast our humiliation ends and restarts every 4 years, you guys have to put up with this manchild and his offspring for life. / []
so what business you had meeting with Epstein Celebrate his Jewish Hanukkah haha / []
He can lie and denie but he needs to know it’s coming for him  God almighty knows everything   You can have money, fake access to everything in this short world but you will pay for it soon And you’ll be paying for eternity / []
New York City have dozens of 5 star hotels, that heads of states, families and Diplomats stay at these Hotels..gee, I guess his need to save a few buck$ was most important..! ...” no recollection?” ..wow! Sorry, I don’t believe him / []

Why didn’t anyone interview that Boyle in his neck. Its been witness to everything / []
Constant blinking,  constant stutter.  Liar Liar pants on fire 🤬🤬 / []
Why would Prince Andrew use one of Epsteins houses when he could stay at any place he wanted.  Liar Liar pants on fire 🤬🤬 He was advised against doing this interview but being as pompous as he is he still went and did it.  Already I have seen many lies in the first 10 minutes.  Liar Liar pants on fire 🤬🤬 / []
And then, if you believe body language,  he blinks his eyes a few times quickly when lying. Not just him either..Meghan Markle during Oprah interview and Amber Heard during her and jd trial...now you know what to look for... / []

1:55 "He had the extraordinary ability to bring people together." Sounds like an accurate description of human trafficking. / ['lol. i heard that as "i don\'t regret meeting him, he\'s really added value to my life! It is a shame that he also destroyed the life of many children as a large scale pedophile. but man, he sure did make my life better. :) "', 'You know, with Epstein, the more I learn about that guy, the more I don’t care for him', '"Bring people together" , for what purposes?']
doing a number of things in New York literally a prince with the highest ability to learn about anything any amount of info is available to him  and he just wasn’t aware of what Epstein who he was… / []
This is what happens to greedy people. They don’t care who what how favours and money come in as long as they come in. Charles is having problems now too because few occurrences are coming up the surface regarding being handed millions in cash in Fortnum & Mason shopping bags, etc. / []

I thought there were a few problems with the approach of the interviewer, such as repeating things fairly often, and not bringing attention to enough flaws in Andrew's own reasoning, instead moving on, without challenging what he was saying. An example I remember is that she didn't ask why he went to Epstein's mansion in New York, when he already had accommodation, as he had said earlier that he had only visited for convenience, and for lodging. In that case, he already had some. Why did he visit? The interviewer didn't ask.  More importantly, what I want to say is that Andrew was fairly consistent in implying that he found it perfectly fine to be friends with a sex offender and paedophile, so long as it was not publicised, and so long as he was not convicted of it. His stated reasoning for abandoning the relationship was that it was publicised, and that, since he was a member of the royal family, he should not be associating with Epstein. This implies that he does not think that being friends with a sex offender is inherently a bad thing. Andrew Windsor is morally bankrupt, and does not deserve his titles, his position, or his high status in society (the rest of family doesn't, either, but, even if the institution of the royal family was assumed to be justified, he doesn't deserve it). In my opinion, he is truly a terrible man. / ['There was a lot of ground to cover in a limited amount of time. If she had pissed him off too much, he would have walked out and not answered any more questions. Her job as a journalist in getting the truth out to the public was more important than her acting as judge, jury, and executioner.']
Imagine an interview such this on Mountbatten's hindi boys. / []
I am glad he is paying her by today.... due to court, lost his job and uniform in England while back.. Futher I hope Wexner the Victoria Secret owner from Ohio will be held accountible for his involvement to traffick young girls for many years with Epstein and Maxwell / []
He is so full of shit, I don't believe anything he said, just unbelievable. I believe that he is just like him...a child molester!!! / []
I'd love to see the dislike ratio. 1st he said he wanted a court trail then he said he didn't. He said he didn't do it, but he did pay £12 million to avoid court trail.  He admitted to being £12 million in the wrong...Sound like he didn't do it to you? lol / []

I'm stunned at the one-sided opinion people seem to have about Prince Andrew and his relationship with Mr. Epstein. I totally agree that when you commit a crime you should be punished. After you have served your time in jail, it's all fair and square again. I think it's pathetic if people aren’t willing to give people with convictions a second chance. What purpose is served by refusing to give somebody with a conviction a second chance? World is a sad place if one is supposed to lose all friends after being convicted. I would never do that to a friend. I think it's great that Andrew stayed Epstein's friend and gave him a second chance. / []

He really is a coward. He basically admits to using Epstein for social networking . And also despite Epstein being who he was I find it so cold the way he speaks about his friends suicide. When Emily says 'Epstein is dead' he slightly laughs it's incredibly strange to watch. He really genuinely comes across as a awful person. / ['Used him and then had him killed when it became too hot for him']
What a disastrous interview for Andrew. He was completely lying on about everything / ["Well Dr Watson Allegedly a person call lady Victoria claims to know the person who took the photo.

6:15 well if him being at his house with underage girls wasnt a hint then whatever organization against sex trafficking kids or whatever he said then he wasnt a good fit for it im sure a person in charge in such thing should be able to be identifying things and know epstien was a rapist but oh wait so was andrew / []
At the most this guy can be accused of cheating his partner! No big deal! His brother did it too!!! / []
Watch the film 'Trading Places' / []
23:20 of course just look at me I look beautiful / []
Shit men disgusting 🤢 / []
Tsk tsk Such damning questions..... / []
Birds of the same feather..... / []
Arrogant POS / []
He lies like a naughty child. Dirty old git / []
Why go see him to 'break up and cease contact'?  He could have just separated himself from that monster and declined any contact at all.  Andrew had an agenda and too much was at risk. / []
It's alright Prince Andrew, we all know very affluent and iconic, wealthy, elite, royal, governmental, secret societies, upper echelon types globally have rituals, rites, ceremonies, and incest pedophilia, hebephiles etc. Same happens here in North America too. More common than people believe to be true I reckon. Teenage pvzzy is the *BEST* / []
Why would he be stupid enough to take a photo with an underage girl he is sleeping with.  Doesn't make any sense  He seems to be telling the truth in the interview  People just love to believe the worst / []
sound is too low; reupload after fixing level of the sound / []
He is another reason why I hate the royal family. He should be in jail. I only have respect for Harry and Meghan / []
Where's shaggy when you need him . But we caught you on camera? "It wasn't me" that's your hand on her shoulder "it wasn't me"😅😅 / []
6:35 7:40 8:20 32:35 / []
G-U-I-L-T-Y / []
I've enjoyed rewatching this knowing Ghislaine has got hers and Andrew is very (too) slowly getting his...The man (if you can call him that) is an embarrassment to humanity. / ['😂😂😂😂']
This woman did a terrific job of running him into a corner with every question!!   But yet here will all sit and do nothing about it? They ALL do it. / []
Prince Andrew the coward. / []
who needs investigators when you have this 60 minutes interview? He is saying all! love the bit where he refers to partys with the proeminent, intelectual high society (politics included). Was it a hint or a warning to other participants??🤔 / ['hillary clinton. john podesta. theres more']
Hilarious to me how he mysteriously ended up dead & a worldwide airborne epidemic strikes the world when famous celebrities start getting named as his associates in pedophilia. 😁💉 Politics and psychology...😂 / []
This whole affair just shows that you only need breeding, money and influence, not brains.  This man is a Born into privilege, power, & money moron. But he got away with all the alleged crimes because mommy has the money, power and influence to ''Fix It'' for Randy Andy. / []
Lying piece of shit trying to act all proper and “ Grand “ / []
This guy is like one of the villains in the Pirates of the Caribbean / ["Well he is a villain (allegedly). Must say, after this interview I was convinced he was guilty of something if not everything lodged against him. Then, when mommy Queen Liz bailed him out and paid off the (alleged) victims, so it wouldn't go to court or mean him having to go to the US for questioning, well that was a sign of guilt for most people. Still he got away with it because of who he is, and walks around a free man. \nI'm surprised it hasn't finished off the monarchy. (It wouldn't upset me if they went for good, make Queen Lilibet the last monarch)"]
He is lying like a disgusting rug what a pig / []
29:45. / []
28:53 I don't think that could happen at all"  It's so easy to dissect this interview and catch him out on his lies / []
IT Takes Two 2 Tango.....When you stop welfare (Natural Resources) payments....Young girls turn to Prostitution...the world over... / []
He says there was “ No evidence “ of anything being not right.  If you watched any of the documentaries one of his victims was an artist that was hired to make paintings for Epstein,  his house was filled with art with nude children and young girls… Duuhhh He knew exactly what was going on and I’m sure was a full willing participant..  Being raised as a  British Royal he has been well trained to stay away from any shady or questionable people.. / []
The shame of a member of the Royal Family is laid bare for all to see thanks to the interviewer.  What a totally disgusting entitled creep.  Andrew should be made accountable, but I guess he never will be. / []
I do not ever remember meeting her which is why I’m settling with her to the tune of 20 million! / ['All funded and provided by taxpayers.']
Why settle anything if you didn’t do anything wrong! The one problem I have with all of this is why did the girls wait so long to say anything? / []
Excuses! / []
🙄🤦‍♀️ / []
I was waiting for "a bit of a stretch Pandy" to say " I'm still a virgin , and proudly so" ! They must have edited it out".. / []
How would he know it was upstairs!  He said this photo was taken upstairs and I’ve never been upstairs.  How would you know it was upstairs.  Wow!  This is horrible.🤥 sick, with all his teddy bears! / []
Is it true that Peter’s home in the Caribbean is only 8 miles from Epstein Island? / []
I just watched about 15 min. of this Interview. I have never felt more ashamed of another person. I simply cannot stand it. / []
So...... One of his faults is his “tendency to be too honorable.”  🤨 / ['He loves his pizza', 'This people think we stupid']
Harry Enfields Tim nice but dim.  ;) / ['Very much so. I see Demonic Raab and a couple of others in that party in the same way. (rich but dim).']
none of us are important to the world or our species ( despite all vistas ) but being born without any proving then you should be put to the bottom of the ladder to rise again by your 'ability' / ['to show the world your magnificence']
🤣 I was shot at so therefore I can't sweat and I'm so honorable I stayed at the home of a p£dophile for 4 days to tell him we're no longer friends. And for some reason people photoshop hands in inappropriate places whenever I take a photo with underage girls. And Virginia R. is a rotten liar and should be take to the dungeon.. oh wait I mean prosecuted of course.. yes definitely no dungeons here, noting to see.. / []
GUILTY AS FUCK! / []
Boring, old news. / []
F him and BBC / []
I felt sorry for the Queen having to strip her son of all of his titles and privileges. That must of really saddened her a great deal. / ["Don't forget she raised him. Would you bring up your child to have such ignorance of basic moral standards?", "@lyrebird9749 The Queen's other 3 children have had the same upbringing I assume and they seemed to have lived a life of Royal privilege with a fair degree of responsibility and respect for their relative positions.  Prince Charles when he was younger had some issues,  but I think now he has obviously matured. But it seems Prince Andrew went off the rails and I don't think you can lay the blame entirely on his mother, the Queen.", '@SeauinIreland Prince Charles "had some issues" ! LOL. He was 32 when he married a 19 yr old woman he barely knew and didn\'t really love, then had a long running affair whilst married, leading his wife (Diana) to depression & bullimia. \n\nPrincess Anne also had an affair and divorced while her kids were still young. \nSure, she\'s done a lot of good work but in terms of their domestic lives,  Edward is the only one who seems to be responsible.', 'No thoughts for the actual victims but for those who supported this lifestyle. Says a lot.']
It's not that he slept with children he just couldn't bare admitting to his wife that he slept with a younger and prettier model / []
This is the greatest interview of ALL time 🔥😂 / []
OMG how many times does he say UMM / []
£12m of our money later and Andy boy is off scott free / []
They've all been there all the rich guys knocking about Young girls 💯. But that's okay? / []
48:05 her face at this filthy clown, utter disgust / []
does anyone believe he was not having sex with minors ???  im shocked he agreed to this interview!! the interviewer has facts lol she did great work!! / []
“Absolutely no indication” / []
"It was a convenient place to stay"...hes a prince, one phone call and he's got a limo and a penthouse ready to go anywhere he wants / ['Haha 😎✈️', 'There are no hotels in Manhattan, right?', '\u200b@MaxMustermann-hd7oe lol right, maybe he "couldn\'t afford it" and he HAD to stay at epsteins to save money']
Какой замечательный английский язык из уст Emily, дикция, интонация, тон. Слушать эту беседу удовольствие 💐💐💐 / []
PHFFFFFFFF oFF / []
Am I a accessory after the fact for helping to pay off the accuser his royal dryness. / []
We wonder exactly the same.  Is that the Royal “we”?  Is that The Firm wondering? / []
Ghislaine brought people together for Epstein’s pleasure and business. / []
John Brockman.... after she said that name, i bet  OlAndy's heart rate jumped 80bpm. he couldnt believe she knew Brockman was in the building. / []
What  a masterclass in interviewing by Emily Maitlis.. She makes him look like a compulsive liar. He dug himself into a big hole. And yes 'he had to go and see him'...we know why. If he is clean, as he believe he is, he should have no hesitation in undertaking a polygraph test. / []
A textbook example of how to to complete total and utter social suicide. Well done sir. / []
Such a funny & caring person. Funny enough, he had no s.ex with a minor cos he doesn’t remember it. He is just too honorable hence he decided to pay 12M settlement to a woman he never met. If it was a pizza, he would remember. Mind you. / []
Guilty people go around the houses with their explanations.. / []
Guilty af!!!!!!!! / []
what opportunities were given to him to learn? i’ve heard that response so many times now and without really qualifying the claim with examples, it’s a pithy excuse.   what a disgrace to the royal family, the UK, and the male gender. / []
Oh yeah his face and reactions tell the truth story doesn't help him / []
The poor Queen had to be out of her mind with anger when she found out.. 💓 / ['I understand what you mean but it was well known she was an absent mother and it’s clear that it effected her children, the men in particular, very much. Charles needed Camilla for that comfort, motherly figure. And a lack of relationship from mom to child can create cold people who have difficulty with human relationships.', 'Before she paid off all the media and the victims']
40:38 Moving on...Epstein is dead (cue the laughter of Andrew)..... / []
Why hasn't he took a lye deter test just to see how indent. He really was. / []
Interviewer 1, Prince Andrew 0. / []
Lol he kept dropping the Navy in,Andy was looking for a thanks for ur service. / []
Hey Andrew, Im a medium, I got a message from Epstein for you : I LUV YOU LONG TIME. / []
"and it would be, to some extent a stretch to say...we were close friends". The interviewer did not suggest that they were "close friends", but that Andrew and Epstein had a "friendship". So here, Andrew is jumping the gun by promoting the interviewer's suggestion, in order to attempt to pre-address and deny that he and Epstein were close friends. This is a massive red flag indicating that Andrew and Epstein were indeed, close friends.It would not be  a stretch to presume that any close friend of Epstein's would surely be privy to, and thereby in tacit agreement with, any activity encountered, at any of his residences. / []
The Royal family are a well organised criminal enterprise. Let’s never forget that this scum bag got away with sexually abusing a minor because of his entitlement and who he was. / []
15:30 he says fact of the fatter is / []
why the hell did he agree to this lol / ['Because he thinks he more intelligent than normal folk and untouchable.']
Would be easier for him, to list the things he recollect. Always deny, folks! / []
I’m always astounded at how stupid the royal family is….like the majority of them are just dumb as rocks 🪨 it’s odd. / []
We were barely friends but I had to go to a convicted sex offenders house and explain why we can’t be friends anymore. Even the Brits aren’t that courteous. / []
Please, when is the monarchy abolished??? / []
The book "The Palace Guard" by Tina Brown goes into this quite in depth in her book. the mystery is why would this man sit down for such a devastating interview, knowing full well what the questions would be (he would have HAD to know she would ask). / []
and Fergie never walked in on you in bed with another person ( gender I will keep out ) / was the talk of the town back in the 90's / []
my staff and my people - honestly ugh / []
I might watch this once a year as a car crash example of what not to do with the media - arrogant turd and idiot / []
crap liar too  üst have to look at the false response to the question of 'how did he'(Epstein) react to Andy panda saying we must cut ties' total blather / could this idiot not have even prepared his lies a better ( yes he could but can't due to arrogance and being little more than pond life ) Hideous individual. Should go on holiday with Boris. / []
thick as mince / []
how did you get invited to a meeting of 'extraordinary' people. The only thing that is extraordinary about you is nothing of you control jut the womb you came from. Creep of the highest order ( 2 ways that ) ugh fat Andy - you are so engaging - not / self entitled spoilt brat. / []
I think epstien was assasinated in his cell and then made to look like it was suicide he was killed so he could not plea bargain for lesser sentence as he may have spilled the beans about everything / []
For all the public engagements these royals do they really are just terrible at public engagements and speaking. / []
The royal household have declared that this interview was great for Andrew, that's how deluded the royals are, he's a privileged man above the law which is a shame because we hold the royals in high esteem and its an illusion, their above the law and shouldn't be / []
It’s rumoured that he took acting lessons from Mr Stacey. He should ask for his money back! He was shite. Did he have advanced looking at her questions! Hence the looks he gives with his answers!! BS / []
That overdose of adrenaline  in the falklands conflict made it impossible for him to sweat. That comment alone would convict him in any court. No doctor on this planet would ever agree with the grand old duke of york 🙄 / []
I love watching this unmitigated disaster as somehow it brings me joy to see this muppet exposed for what he really is. / []
What omg are you serious, how is this guy not in jail. You can tell he's hiding something in the way he's talking. / []
Train wreck... / []
I think that if you listen hard enough, you can hear Andrew’s legal team collectively facepalm. / []
I got stung by a bee as a child and I haven't sweat since. / []
Just watched this 3/6/22,is this for real,face voice tells all he lied so many times,royal peadofile,they still around,wait and watch news SOON. / []
I don't recollect isn't a denial....who briefed this berk?? / []
Chris Hanson walks out "Andy,why don't go ahead & have a seat right there on the stool." / []
27.08 IF the photo was taken upstairs and you never been there ....how would you know whats Up there huh. Take away his WP and throw His ass out in the gytter where he belongs / []
This is just as alwardly embarrassing and ridiculous as Amber Heards testemony. Liar liar pants om fire. Why DO this when you this bad att lying 😩😂🤣🤣🤣 / []
Victims testified that Epstein’s FL and and NY homes had pictures of girl all over his walls. / []
I’m veering towards Andrew was a pawn in the sick world of Epstein,is he  a spoilt brat yes absolutely but that’s down to his mother she had two children before him & produced an heir to the throne. Andrew was born out of love & indulged accordingly.I want to see the original photo that lady Victoria says was Epstein not Andrew.I believe her, her credibility she would not risk  her reputation & credibility on  such a powerful worldwide case of such deplorable disgusting poor excuses of human beings. I believe he settled for his mum & I believe lady Victoria when she says Virginia Dufrae has refused help & support to other victims of Epstein. I’m not for one minute saying she went through such vile sexual acts that should be punished but she went after the one person she knew that had so much to loose & that turns her from been a victim who deserved justice into    a person who would stop at nothing to ensure everyone was cannon fodder to her. / []
Can all the white people please condemn prince andrews acts / []
Very guilty / []
Prdo / []
He explains there was  Absolutely no indication that Jeffrey Epstien was sexual deviant.  Law enforcement confiscated lots of "art" of underage girls hanging in plain sight! As for being sweaty while dancing. "Well I simply don't drink or sweat." He had a medical condition At The Time from the war. 🙄 He just keeps shooting himself on the foot! / []
29:15 blatantly lying. It’s actually embarrassing and an Insult to basic intelligence that he thought we would swallow this bs. / []
There's no prince, princess, kings ,queens, etc, its outdated going back to a time when there was no elected governments, times have changed. / []
So happy Prince William is doing everything he can to stop him been a working royal even moving his family to be closer to the queen so Andrew can't control her so easily. / []
There was a lot of overexplaining and unnecessary detail when it came to the photo in question. A very simple, honest answer would have been "That indeed is a photo of me however given I have never met the individual in question, it is not possible this photo is in fact an original photo" / []
He is a parasite!! Free the world from the monarchy!!! Long live Ireland / []
Can’t wait to see him in a jail!!! 🎶😆 / []
He’s saying yes while shaking his head no most prominently at 2:20… and so many other times. Makes me wonder why he’s such a bad liar / []
Beast / []
Horrible man / []
How can he sit there and tell lies that he has never met this girl thats him in the photo / []
What you would describe as scum of the earth.. All there powerful rich ppl.. Scum I don't care they are politicians academics etc... / []
How to interview a narcissistic lying clown / []
He probably did something wrong, but at what point is there forgiveness? Do we torture him forever for having consensual sex in 2001?  Assuming he knew her age, 17 is a legal age in the UK.  She has already been compensated recently, with £12 million, so at what point do we stop turning the thumb screws on him?  And on reflection, I wonder if he should have been more honest but also firm that it was consensual? / []
Amber Heard will be perfect for him. They both have same aura and gesture. When he said yes to the questions while looked at the camera at the same time, it reminds me how AH answered questions from lawyers while kept looking at the jurors everytime she said "yes" 🙄 dejavu / []
Watched the full thing just today, finally. What a joke. I bet he hasn't stopped sweating since it broadcast... / []
This is truly a wonderful piece of film. The best actor in the world couldn’t capture the authenticity of a man so coddled by a corrupt system that he believes that all of his words would be celebrated. / ['oh, when the kingdom falls, it falls hard!', 'spot on 100% couldn’t have seid it better', 'I can\'t believe he said he wis words were "colored" because he is "too honorable". Unbelievable.', 'I feel sorry for the Queen that at the time she watched this and had to see him piss his credibility away.What a disgrace.', '@wlhansen2068 I heard the Queen gave him two million to add to his 10 million to pay this young woman off.']
Why would you feel the need to visit somebody for 4 days, just to tell them you can't be seen with them anymore. Specially, when you describe your relationship with that person as, one of your friends "+1" / []
He was always my favourite Royal- because he went to the Falklands when he didnt have to go & had a proper job as a Naval Officer. Its sad his love of opulence led to dodgy pals & his arrogance & the privileged bubble in which he lives means he cannot grasp how he is perceived- But would any of us be any different; had we been born to in a gilded bubble of  palaces, splendour & obsequious servants? / []
Prince Andrew: “If you are somebody like me then people behave in a subtly different way”.  Yeah Andy, they have to talk to you like a five year old and use shorter words that you can understand! / []
"I know exactly where I was, I was in a Pizza Express in Wapping".....strange the staff at Pizza Express Wapping haven't confirmed his story, it's not like a member of the Royal Family drops in every day with their families for a thin crust pizza....... / ["What's Wapping? 😂😂", '@jamesy666 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping', '@mickg8306 he said pizza express in Woking not Wapping']
Thick Skin?? / []
All the focus on Andrew, there are bigger fish out there that need to be caught. / []
Everyone else is dead or in jail he walks free here have £12 million fucked up world / []
Can't imagine how the victims of this monster who are watching this interview are feeling ...disgusting / []
Throughout the whole interview he looks like a dog whose just farted and pretends he hasn’t. / []
I didn’t do anything,,,,, but here have over 10million pounds. 🤡🌍 / []
He come out as a freaky I. di. OT. / []
I was just thinking to myself that even if I had watched this BEFORE knowing all the evidence I'm positive I would have picked up that he was a lying piece of chit nonze / []
I love how she tore him a new 1 & did so very politely & with such a sweet smile! She set up the hurdles & he fell at every one of them. / ['If she tore him a new one she would’ve been asking the emergent questions of his most damning statements made in the interview…. Instead she seems to stick to the pre approved line of questioning\n\nWhich nicely ends on notes about rehabilitation of his image LMAO']
Minute 15:58  😆 🤣  guilty that body languaje said  at all. / []
Well, he is honest, he said that Epstein place was convenient to stay and there were many interesting people at those parties. / []
Surely he must do another TV interview to undo this annus horribilis. / []
He is vile, a total embarrassment and disgrace. He should be is prison / []
He paid the kid $12 million to stay shut / []
Your the chicken you could not face the courts you big cowerd you settled out of court and payed 12 million so the royal family did not here what you did to this girl sick pedo / []
OH give over..there is a sexual predator in  every street we all live in...believe it or not.!   Robert's was only after the dollars and she succeeded in that.   She herself trafficked young girls. Has she been silenced?? more dollars.  Prince Andrew may have made a few hiccups...oh sorry he had a massage..(dirty old man)..laughable.  I believe in innocence  till proven guilty speaking as a legal secretary for 18 years to a sole practitioner.  I await the day to see Roberts/gufffrie on the stand under oath. / []
Noice / []
😲🤣HE COULDN'T SWEAT???  If miss Roberts claimed Andrew was constantly blinking...Andrew would say thats impossible because that year, my belt was too tight and it caused constraint in my abdomen, which prevented me from blinking. This idiocy from a "ROYAL"? BRAVO!!👎 / []

She failed big time at 30 plus, she cornered him re getting a foot massage on arrival at the island, he appeared to brush by, but she should have said" did you ever bet a foot massage" and from whom ? Never pushed it and made him squirm more...? / []
I'm sure it has gone through your head many times.. yet you still can't give a proper reason as to why you were still friends with a paedophile. What he's saying sounds so stupid that  I'm getting second hand embarrassment from listening to him. And if you're going to say you don't drink, maybe get rid of the booze sitting on the table next to you. SMH / []
Prince Andrew is one big story teller l have never heard so much  bull / []
His Royal Lowness Andrew, HONORABLE, delightfully funny if not for subject. But what a good laugh he gave the world here / []
Lmao this man said I never seen Jeffery with a camera in my life 🤦🏾‍♀️ / []
The man in the iron mask / []
Police can retrieve cctv at that restaurant Tramp, eye witnesses such as waiters/ manager, street side cctv of Maxwells house, etc. / []
Love to imagine the rest of the royal watching this back home and cringing / ['They supported him']
He’s like a real life character from the office! / []
He suffers from Amber Heard syndrome, over acting face contortion! / []
The royal family is dirt completely. / []
He reminds me of Damien thorn from the Omen movie / []
Why are royal fanboys/fangirls wasting all their anger and hatred on Meghan when they should be using all that energy towards Prince Andrew? / []
This Buffoon has the audacity to think he can pick up where he left off before he was found out, is stupid. / []
I'm scared for Virginia. Behind how comedically bad this interview is, he appears angry with her for speaking out. She's brave for tackling this degree of power and depravity. / ['Virginia is a gold digging Ho.', 'this was two years ago.', '@Charlotte226 And yet none of Maxwells clients have been investigated.', 'Virginia moved to Australia.', '@glendaburrell7435 I thought she was on some remote exotic island lingering on the beach with the millions the royal family gave her to settle her civil suit after declining to sign a criminal complaint against Andrew!']
HRH The Prince of Baloney! 🎉😮. / []
He isnt HRH Prince andrew now he is just Andrew Winsdsor or whatever. He's headed for prison no doubt. / []
Watching this many times with the benefit of an analytical legally trained mind and endless experience of the phenomenon of the 'rabbit in the headlights' I find that while the Prince is frequently awkward with his responses, rambles and  produces some rather strange explanations such as the subject of 'sweating' and the 'Pizza Hut' in Woking scenario, there is nothing that the interviewer has to effectively challenge what he says. Her technique is very good but the evidence to prove the Prince is lying or attempting to disguise the truth simply isn't there !, Even though he appears to invite the killer question, fact, or indisputable evidence several times, the coup de grāce never comes. What we actually have here is a tawdry collection of unsubstantiated quotes, gutter press rumour mongering and public hysteria plus the assertions,claims and counter claims of two individuals of dubious character. What we don't have is.... Pure, indisputable, reliable, hard evidence. Any Junior Barrister would laugh themselves to death on being asked to consider this third rate Fish and Chip wrapping as a viable prosecution prospect!!. What Prince Andrew is undeniably guilty of is making very poor decisions,- friendship with Maxwell & Epstein, giving the interview and making the enormous donation to the alleged victim 's .... 'Charity' !. One presumes that he had expert advice on the matter? , But, if he did?, Then clearly they were every bit as foolish and inept as the Prince himself!. / ["I think you'll find that being an apologist for elite sexual predators is a fairly unpopular stance to take.", "@diwlelomo well I'm sure you're quite right.

I don’t sweat 😂💩💩 / []
A Livechat would have been funny / []
The fear in his eyes / []
I've never met Prince Andrew, where is my $12M? / []
17yrs old  Virginia was her name,she worked at mar-a-lago,ghislane found her An this guy SA her an did not give a single fuck / []
You know he is lying his lips move / []
I cant believe this idiot man no wonder his mum shuns him off in a corner what a dumb fkr honestly. / []
Why is everyone roasting this man on cause the fked a prostitute??? It’s because she had 2 or 3 months till 18?? Lol… 60 days makes a difference?? / ['She was sex trafficed and it was shown the island had tons of child nudity']
He is such a liar.   Huge disgrace to the Royal Family.   Fortunately, the Queen seems to have put him in his place, mostly.  He treats his staff terribly.  He needs to slink away from public view since he has thoroughly disgraced himself, and surround himself with those who believe his lies and support him:   his 72 teddy bears.  I think when Charles becomes the King, Andrew will find he is in for a rougher time of it than his Mumy has dealt him.  And if he is still alive when William ascends the throne, he will finally get his behind the scenes exile. / []
As an Irish man and a human being I feel sorry for his Mother and for all descend men or women who are born decent. / ['If they are descent they would have given him in for jail...but they dint..are they decent?']
He looks so awful,and he evades everything. I think AA is appropriate. It’s humiliating and frustrating as a victim. Why the fuck would you choose to go down that route. Holy fuck, that that that, because up are a drunk and addict. / []
'I don't know where the bar is'...in a nightclub...come on...everyone knows where the bar is when you are in a bar or club regardless of if you buy a drink or not. / []
This guy is pure slime! / []
Liar liar your bums on fire / []
how would he know that the photo was taken upstairs, if the 'never was upstairs' ? 😂 / []
As with BoJo, the definition of a party is a social gathering of invited guests. Whether you recognise it as a party or not is irrelevant - you attended.  The same way a parking charge notice cannot be recinded/appealled on the basis that you didn't know there was a toll. / []
Many people believe that Epstin  was killed by influenceal people       If he didn’t die it could be very dangerous for famous people    All people and equipments were disconnected and left nothing for people to see  and  they did  Good job of coverup / []
I think that went rather well 🧐 / []
All about the money money money. Woman do this all the time. / []
And this is Mummy's favorite, huh? / []
"At the end of the day...it was a wrong decision and I admit my judgement was coloured by my tendency to be too honorable". Therefore, why would he stay at his mansion in first place. He is disgusting. / []
Wonderful man, Not sure about her she thinks she knows it all but knows very little really. / []
Peadophile / []
This is what happens when you live a protected, entitled life of privilege. Andrew cannot comprehend for a millisecond that anyone - anyone - would not believe him, for no other reason than he is a member of the royal family.  Naive yes - tragically so. / []
Car crash tv at its finest 🤦🏻‍♂️ / []
I sort of agree with his views about the pic! If he was with a minor he would never leave an evidence.. let alone a pic with her and his hand on her hip.. too good of a proof to be true. / []
When’s the Bill Clinton interview? / ['when Epstein arises from the dead^^']
40.36 This dude sucks. But his lying is, as many have said, amusing. But he actually laughs when she says that the other gross dude is dead😂 / []
'A shooting weekend. A Straightforward shooting weekend'. That clears it up. / []
He's not a confrontational person 45 mins but early he said he prefers to confront people and not be a chicken. / []
Prince Andrew “ How can I get a foot massage from a young Russian woman, I don’t have any Bloody feet” 😂 / []
Dude you are guilty it's all over your face also your tie is a little crooked lol 😊😅 / []
I do have to say, how many times do u have to settle out of court even when ur innocent? Epstein was beyond creepy & disgusting. Just looking at his picture I lose 10 pounds vomiting for a week. I feel sorry for that woman doing Epstein. BUT honestly there are a few things about her story that I just dont buy. Never believe someone's story 100%. Dont call it victim shaming, I've definitely been there in the worst ways. / []
I'm getting the word........... / []
This is a train wreck. / []
this is how the elites treat young girls it's still going on, where is the client list why do we not have the names? because they are all still in office or whatever, the Bidens the Clintons, and many more are not household names but in our institutions money corrupts / []
Impossible to sweat... / []
The best part is that he believes that he has done well and thanks her ! / []
“Do you think it was a good idea to stay at the house of a convicted sex offender?” Andy- yeah because I knew he wouldn’t do anything with me as I’m an adult and not his type, thanks for your concern though / []
Creepy rich guys were drawn to JF by the possibility of bangin a teen / []
HE DOESN'T GET IT HOW ARROGANT AND ENTITLED HE COMES ACROSS. HE WAS SO ARROGANT HIS CHIEF ADVISOR RESIGNED. / []
So many recents comments. This video is booming / []
Guilty people are easy / []
Guilty / []
What royal family are you a member of sir ?! / []
He had an extraordinary ability to bring people together. Not wrong there. / ['Jeffery had something they wanted. Young girls!!!!']
Why does he look like he needs a good burp 🙃 / []
Just another SEX offender ...he should be in jail with the rest of them... / []
I’m not a big fan if at all of the royal family but my god I can’t stand this privileged entitled nob. Now he’s paid her off he seems to think it’s back to being pedo he is. / []
I believe him for the most part. / []
His Mother must be devastated. / []
NO CONVICTIONS OR LISTED NAMES!!! NWO!? / []
😆why give an interview if your just gonna lie about it all ,,, every one knows if your hanging out with Jeffery Epstein your looking to abuse kids period 🙄 / []
He is disgusting! I never want o meet him or Harry or Meghan! / []
once again am born as a daughTer         never lived in uK    i gave birTh 2 daughTers myself      in my life was  no Teenager scandal no Mr EbsTein     mysTerious  whaTs     goin on / ['am  born on 28. April my age 56', 'and i live wiTh my 2nd daughTer .... again']
not to be believed. everything you can do wrong, he did. / []
32:45 "Four times a year?!?!" LOL / []
I love Andy. Such an honest chap! / []
Revolting, little tapeworm. / []
"And by mutual agreement, we decided to part company".... As in :"fuck, they're on to us Jeff, we've got to get our stories straight mate, act natural, know what I mean, I'm out of here"... Edit: "......... you and her, in a Nightclub and you sweating profusely". "I didn't sweat at that particular time.....or, actually,.....yes.... no, I didn't sweat at the time". Uh, what "time" is that, the "time" in question, the "time" you deny being present at ?? / []
He remembers going to pizza place because it was so unsual for him, but he can't remember anything about being with that specific minor, because it so normal for him? / []
He has a big guilty sign around his neck. It’s a pathetically feeble attempt to absolve himself of the crimes committed. / []
i think he is being honest. / []
“Extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary pedophiles together”     you mean / []
At that time it was impossible for me to sweat😅😅👌 / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender!“ 🙃🙃 / []

Does every soldier who gets shot. At stop sweating for a time / []
Been 2 years. Who are the buyers of the young girls? / []
I don’t have a degree in anything however all it takes is common sense to tell he is lying through his teeth. Watch his eyes and movements he is very uncomfortable with most questions. He should be sent to prison for what he did to children. / []
I really don’t like him he should be in prison. He lying 100%  what ball shit / []
If he couldn't  sweat he would  be seriously  ill doctors  watching this must be laughing  at him. / []
He didnt know  where the bar was so he couldn't  ask. / []
It was a convenient  place to stay yes free sex on the dinner menu. / []
Oh he wasn't  aware when the party invitations went out yes we believe  that such a fool to think we would  believe  him all stutters looks a right fool. / []
Everything  is a bit of a stretch  he never gain a party prince  he gained a reputation  he should have said  he regretted  ever meeting  Epstein  he is dense hasn't  got a clue thick as 2 short planks no wonder  he wasn't  clever enough to go to university. / []
oi  Randy Andy   Shame on U / []
Quando sei nel panico perché sei stato scoperto, aggiungi disastro a disastro / []
Quando ti senti scoperto, disperato, vulnerabile,ti sale l'ansia, vai nel panico e vuoi per forza agire per porre rimedio alla catastrofe, non sapendo bene però in quale modo sarebbe meglio farlo. Magari immagini che sarebbe bene agire in un'altra maniera oppure non fare niente di eclatante ed aspettare gli eventi, ma in quel momento lì, può accadere che ti affidi alla decisione sbagliata senza pensarci più di tanto. Vuoi soltanto agire La cosa È PIÙ FORTE DI TE / []
Prince Andrew can come to my party. / []
He and boris johnson should form their own political party. They have a lot in common, both despicable slimy liars. / []
It's pathetic the style of Clown Andrew. This posh British bullshit full of nothing but condescension and self superiority to everything and everybody is completely not human. Has never been and now in 2022 is completely out of place.People need to end with Monarchy and the clowns that represent it. / []
No one is above the law …yea right bull shit / []
Lieing royal POS. Blames Everybody else. Ban BBC from America. We need Our country back. Example- see G.H.W.Bush Sr. when he said Americans would kill him and all politicians for the Treachery they are committing behind Our backs. No wonder demoncrats want to take Our guns away. Well. It is that time to rebell and take Our country back out of the control of those who are illegally holding power and cheating on the votes. / []
I bet he wished he sold that interview to Netflix... / []
ROYALS   ARE    PEDOS / []
Wow! Is this guy for real? A medical condition that doesn't allow him to sweat? That's is defense. And now today he has been able to start sweating again. Interesting. Just keep digging just keep digging, Dig Dig Dig! He is so believable 😬 / []
A very normal dude from the British Royal family. / []
Weren’t that close yet you went to New York to break up the friendship.  He dug his own grave in this interview / []
The reason Prince Andrew got sucked into the whole Epstein pedophile psychopath thing is Jeffrey Epstein thought if he had all these high profile people he could take down with him they would certainly do whatever it took to make the charges go away! Epstein was devious and cunning and he used people to shield himself and nothing more. He wasn't anyone's friend but his own, not even that crazy woman who is taking the fall for everything now because somebody choked him out in jail. Do you think NY Mayor or police commissioner is going to own that?? Never! There was to many coincidences and I don't believe in coincidence! All it takes is a little common sense to see what's going on there. He made sure he had his photo taken with every celebrity he could and even if they were on a commercial flight he had a photo taken to make it look like they were flying the friendly skies of Epstein Lolita! He wanted any association with any high profile people he could get and the ones with questionable backgrounds were the best.  He was a screwed up individual and he must have had something or tried to run game on the wrong someone and he was choked out! / []
I love the Queen but I dont condone the hangers on. This guy just abused his power and was an absolute shit / []
This geeza  is real beutie . / []
What a disgusting lying sleaze Andrew is, a real piece of work. / []
You have no right to be in the precence of PRINCE ANDREW, his family or anything to do with him. / ['lol.']
the news is a complete lie. / []
What are you talking about reporter. your lieing. / []
YOU 'BUNGLED' THAT ONE JEFFREY ! ! !👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 / []
IF HE WAS AT PIZZA HUT IN WOKING THE STAFF WHO WERE THERE THAT DAY WOULD REMEMBER IT SO LET'S INTERVIEW THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY ! ! ! ? ? ?👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 / []
the prince seem so unconvincing. The host is too good. Sharp as an arrow and very smart with her questions. Bad luck i dont believe the Prince a bit / []
This interview wasn't filmed live. He already had knowledge of the content of questions and yet he STILL incriminates himself. Chinless privileged bafoon. He represents all that is wrong with the upper class thinking that they are above the law. Shame on you and everyone who is protecting you / []
Would love to have been a fly on the wall in the queen’s sitting room when this aired….[*royal china smashes*] “WTF iS hE dOiNg!?” / []
Exile him away forever!! We should never have to see or hear of him again ,period !! Unreal !! Done w these types & they should be banned from everything & everywhere!! / []
Im shore jeffry has video of u swetting. / []
Andrew how the f...k u explain this picture with Victoria and camoooon i didn't sweat at th time. Lol would be better if u just shut the f...k up or be a man and say yes im dirty beeeedo and im sorry / []
@36:50 he is literally choking on his own bullshit / []
The arrogance of this man is just unbearable.  I had to watch it again just for the comedy aspect. If this letch is allowed to worm his way back into public life it will be the downfall of the monarchy. / []
Not sure why until today dumb people are still supporting people in power as if they're good people... there are usually more scumbags in high places than there are in low places / []
There your tax payers cash cow right there,and any1 celebrating that shower of scum are just as bad , / []
Look at these lips exactly like Lying Ted Bundy / []
I love the Queen Elizabeth  her son this was cringe cringe cringe / []
WOW I CAN'T BELIEVE THE LIES HE IS SPEWING - HE RODE ON EPSTEIN'S JET - HE VACATIONED AT EPSTEINS SEX ISLAND - WHAT A LIAR - UNFORGIVABLE THAT HE PREYED ON UNDERAGED GIRLS FOR SEX - I GUESS EPSTEIN OFFERED HIM A CLEAN VAGINA - NO DISEASE- AND CONFIDENTIALITY- WOW UNBELIEVEABLE THAT HE IS NOT IN PRISON - HE WAS A WILLING PARTICIPANT AND ACCESSARY TO THE CRIME AND SHOULD SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS EPSTEIN - AND THAT WOMEN GIZEL - JAIL - BUT I GUESS MONEY DOES HAVE POWER - 12 MILLION DOLLARS WOW - THAT'S ALOT OF MONEY TO SILENCE THAT GIRL AND I AM SURE SHE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT NOT TO SPEAK ON THE CASE AND HIM - IF YOU RESEARCH THE BIOGRAPHY ON ANDREW - YOU MIGHT SEE WHAT I SAW - HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MENTALLY CHALLENGED - AND HIS BEHAVIOR REFLECTS THIS NOW - OUCH - FOOD FOR THOUGHT / []
No sweat, I was at pizza express! / []
Pizza Express in Woking? Mate you gotta be joking.. / []
HE WAS IN AND OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE 😂😂YOU GOT OFF VERY LIGHTLY YOU DIRTY OLD MAN / []
Not being able to fit it in…yeeeah bc he was busy with women.  I can’t understand why he chose to speak here bc he’s digging a hole deeper an deeper.  It’s a stretch to call Epstein a close friend lol but he offered Andrew to stay in one of his many houses for free?  Most of these elites pass women around and swap partners.  They also have information on each other like gangs do with murder which puts them off going to police because they can be taken down for their crimes also. / []
The best part is when she's asking him if he was ever with this young woman and he said he didn't remember her. Then she said "Well we have a photograph of you with your arm around her..." / ['you think he did not know about this photograph ?']
Thick skin reptilian / []
Big stretch / []
I know we are not probably a Dr. But come on what full of sh@#$# haha I feel I bit ofended for her and the world to think that he think we are dump / []
It is a shame that people who should be an example of life, do stupid things. / []
Go anywhere near my daughter and your a D£ADMAN / []
The Andy formerly known as prince. Is Peado rat 😡 his arrogance is phenomenal but not surprising / []
Why couldn't he have the court case televised live stream like Johnny Depp if he's innocent... / []
Just a straightforward shooting weekend. / []
She’s after another payout and got it after she said she wasn’t after money / []
😂🤣😂😍😂🤣😂🤣😂 / []
31:54 it´s a positive act to have sex with adult people, not to ´somebody´!!! He never said ´I would never ever molest an underage girl´. He couldn´t deny his own tastes. / []
28:06 psycopath smile! The journalist is remembering him all the times Virgina told he raped her. He enjoyed that moment while having those memories. Criminal ! / []
Why didn't he admit  it she was 17 / []
You brits must love what your tax is financing !! / []
You would meet academics, famous people, and young girls. Especially young girls / []
What did he put his foot in his mouth multiple times. Not sweating, come on man / []
Never envy someone else's life or status in life.  Live your own life and be moral. Read your Bible daily for yourself to get wisdom. Just look at this prince. / []
If what Andrew is saying is true and he really doesn't recall having sex with Virginia Giufre than he should have no problem calling her  A LIAR AND  HE CAN'T DO THIS. / []
24:54 he knows the photo was taken upstairs but doesn't remember pausing in it and doesn't think that's his hand. / []
Why do all english people sound gay / ['They don’t?']
Gen 18:20 (NLT)  20. So the LORD told Abraham, “I have heard a great outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah, because their sin is so flagrant. / []
Such a crook! / []
How are people so positive that everything he says is a lie? Maybe  he’s just not to bright, maybe he was under impression that this girl was of age of consent. In some states 13 years old can be married / []
Just rolls off the lying pedos tongue. / []
HE IS AN IDIOT!!!!! / []
Pompous, pretentious, toxic man!💯 / []
There is something very dark about the the royal family. / []
Being involved in that organisation is a massive DEFLECTION!!! / []
I’ve just posted a link👇👇 this is absolutely disgusting. Not only Prince Andrew but the Duke - Prince Philip knew about—— the photos show Price Philip being close friends with Jimmy Savil AND Jimmy Savil was also friends with Charles!!!! But let’s not forget Andrew who was friends with Epstine!!   The entire Royal Family has all owned and ran Camp Outward bound where children were repetitively torched and rapped. They have all been friends with the worlds notorious peadofiles. / []
Clearly not a very intelligent man / []
Arrogant, sick 🐷🐶 / []
This man is worst than pinochio  The guy  just can't lie Unbelievable / []
What a parasite …. Staying at other peoples places all the time. / []
How about Jimmy Saville and Cliff Richard, Elm St guest house?😮 / []
What work, what duty? / []
What surprises me the most is not what these two pigs have done but how forgetful we are as a society. This is something that I’m sure keeps going on and most likely only got bigger and more secretive within the filthy rich society. We have normalized not punishing these people and we have become a conformist society who no longer seeks for answers or solutions. / []
even with a shill interviewer and no real grilling, he still managed to fuck it up... the man is a raging pedo and so are the rest of them, he's just the one that's slipped up / []
Absolutely 0 upside to sitting down for this interview with the flimsy answers he provided. Someone gave him terrible advice and answer coaching. / []
I love his reaction to the Mr Brockman comment 😂😂 / []
Virginia Roberts is a opportunist, trying to make a quick buck. / ['Sounds like you are a pedophile. Wouldn’t mind sending the FBI your information.']
Wait... he says the picture was taken upstairs and that picture couldn't be him because he's never been upstairs. How the hell does he know what it looks like if he's never been up there? / []
I must have watched this interview of the Queens favourite son around 10times now & it never gets old but it makes you wonder how much she knew & approved of just how CLOSE her husband & her son Charlie’s friendship with Jimmy Saville was🤔. I suppose it shouldn’t really be surprising,after all this is a palace that was shaped in a huge way from the mind of the 1st Earl Mountbatten,her late husband Phillips FAVOURITE UNCLE,hmmm..& we ALL know about Mountbatten’s PROVEN depraved sexual deviance against kids & that was his FAVOURITE Uncle?!🤷‍♂️ That palace is FILLED with pedos & pedo supporters/apologists,not to mention racists! What a sick country the UK is to accept these types in places with unimaginable privilege & status,never mind millions actively CELEBRATING them!🤷‍♂️🤔…🤷‍♂️ It’s truly🤢🤮inducing! / []
Royal Weasel / []
Sweaty nonc€ / []
It's his facial expression at 13:44 for me... / []
he lied so bad... sad to watch / []
I have never seen someone so unable to answer a simple question and try to make up an answer and further stumble all over themselves before. Would he not have got his facts/story straight before this interview. Guilty written all over it. / ['Lol 😂 Am lost of words 😅 all I do is replying with my imoji 😅']
The fuk is a 'shooting weekend'? / []
If you cant sweat then you will overheat and die. Its that simple. / []
it was a convenience place to stay?!?! Who stay at a sex offender's house for 3 days just because "it was a convenience place to stay" claiming you had nothing to do with what he had done and went there to tell him you can't continue to be friends with him? WOW If he really did that for saving money for hotel, he's a real stupid cheapskate. / []
he is lying / []
He is a pervert, just got away with everything because of his wealth and fame, seems Prince Edward is the only decent man out of all his brothers. / []
Absolutely Disgusting / []
It’s laughable. What a prick, he’s up to his eyes in it, it’s clear in this vid that he’s lying. There is a vid of him saying goodbye to a very young girl when she was leaving the house, he said bye and looked across the road, not sure who was filming it but it caught him red handed. / []
I don’t know about the “Prince” much. But there’s one thing I know about him. He is a liar, period. Well, this monarchy people they’re nothing more than politicians for life. What does Republic democracy saved us from?!Answer is: Politicians for life. Thanks America for that. That’s already good enough! / []
But but but, for for for, the the the, I I I, de de de, I've I've I've, that that that, with with with, had had had, to to to... / []
Get well soon as you recover from Covid Prince Andrew / []
I've never seen such a lack of any real responsibility whatsoever. You can't just accociate with a worldwide KNOWN petto over and over even after he was AWARE of his actions (let's play ddvols advocate and say he didn't know what was going on) he certainly knew about it after he went to jail... So he still went to stay with him multiple times... he isn't some nuanced wide eyed little boy that can just stare blankly and say they just didn't know and its just so unfortunate and think that will work or that he can just get away with hurting people with no real reprecussions. Bot in today's day and age. / []
His message to her should of been sorry…deep sorrow and humiliation at his actions. / []
For been well educated I assume, his choice of words are terrible 😂 it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph 😂😂😂 / []
I dont know where the bar is in tramps...lol..line of the millenia,  at this point his nose poked the interviewer in the eye / []
'In the navy    ........you are out at sea the whole time.' Never have guessed that. / []
if he's never been upstairs, how does he know the pic was taken upstairs? / []
However, in his defence that photo is plain wrong. The hand looks shopped. That's the only time i will stick up for this bumptios individual. / []
You can see him correcting his own lies as he goes along. The absurd sweating thing a case in point. Sad, pathetic man in all honesty. / []
You can never hang out with a dirty person and fail to know. This shit shows itself. / []
i just cannot imagine any normal red blooded man wanting to have sex with one or more drop dead gorgeous sexy 17 year old girls.     that is simply more than i can understand.    now if the guy would wait one day or 2 days until this 17 year old turns 18 well then i can certainly understand it.     it reminds me of this woman i brought to my home and we were sitting in the living room by my coffee table upon which i had put $100,000 in small bills and she just kept staring at all that money.    I was thinking what in the world is wrong with this woman?? / []
virginia roberts was very hungry in fact she was starving and i took her in my kitchen and there on the table was set out all of her most delicious foods.     i told her not to eat anything.     i came back 4 days later and a lot of the food had been eaten but she swares she did not eat any of it.        what do u think happened. / []
I am a man who has been around and I believe u prince andrew.     i certainly would not have sex with a gorgeous sexy young 17 year old girl high on drugs or alcohol, in a secluded place and i am high on drugs and she comes out in a see thru negligee no sir. i would never get aroused at that.    how dare people think that a prince would do such a thing. / []
I can’t sweat because of the trauma and adrenaline rush from being circumcised. / []
This should warn everyone that human trafficking is rampant among the Elite. It’s this global network that needs to be uncovered. / []
His entire account and “pizza express” story is ridiculous. He remembers that so specifically but not being in a nightclub and procuring a minor for sex (r*pe). Yet, her account is incredibly detailed. Don’t even get me started on the “I don’t sweat due to an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War” bullsh*t. Trying to pull on his military service as a cover. / []
The lapsus « he didn’t go into great depth about what I……. What HE was doing » lol the mumbling is telling the truth / []
Why isn’t this disgrace to the human race thrown out of England. Why do the English tolerate having him in their country / ["Perhaps because banishment doesn't occur anymore?"]
I don't know where the bar is 😂😂 / []
What an arrogant piece of shit lol he thinks everyone is dumb and will buy his bullshit / []
See shitty arse has conveniently come down with Covid now. Thoughts and prayers are with the virus. / ['They killed epstein. Suicide my arse. They killed him before he could tell the truth. Epstein was gonna admit him too along with royals from all round the world were involved with trafficking']
It never a good time to talk about Jeffrey Epstein and anything associated….🤔🤔🤔 so You then?🤣🤣 / []

Guilty as phuck / []
but guys you have to remember that at the time this guy should be in jail / []
Apparently his IQ is actually really low too. Doesn't forgive him for anything he did / []
Dumb dumb / []
He is such a dumb dumb, the monarchy needs to pass to William not Charles. Otherwise there will be a car crash / ["It will go to Charles... no doubt about it. Rumor has it that Charles can't stand his embarrassing brother Andrew. He will never be a working royal again, nor should he be."]

I, along w many others call bullshit. She let him bury himself! / []
Jesus ffffing h Christ did he and Boris read from the same script or something!? "It wasn't a party it was a work do. I mean work gathering. Staff meeting. Dinner.....whatever.....😯" I'm almost very nearly impressed.😒. / []
The technique the genius  interviewer used is called “ Let the words speaks for themselves “    She never rose her voice tone like stupid that we see nowadays and she grasp the subject from all it’s aspect ,BRILLIANT . / ['Seems more like she was stuck to a script lmao that common sense interviewer 101 strat is basic. Not brilliant. If you think it’s brilliant I worry about what MSM u consoom that an interview like this is that rare for u…\n\nShe never asked the juicy questions either. She never dug too deep. She also never forgot to ask about rehabilitation of his image. Never forgot to bow her head to the person that just lied for half an hour straight.', "@CoercedJab She got him to talk incriminatingly for over 40 minutes and made him feel so at ease that he left thinking that he'd gotten away with it.

Nobody is impressed by you pretending it isn't.", '@CoercedJab This is a guy who thinks negotiation is flipping the table, and playing supreme hard ball and threatening to walk away.\n\nShe expertly deployed an interview tactic in such a way.

This is how you FU*KED UP royally / []
What some people don’t get is that being “who and what he is doing is a religion. The pope’s audience hall can explain a lot of what I’m talking about. God always wins / []
It's funny how he thinks that saying that he was friends with the woman and not Epstein somehow makes the situation better it makes it worse because she was the one that was procuring all the underage chicks / []
Lies / []
Epstein's wasn't a party. What a lie. / []
she never mentioned area / []
Hopefully Australia will get rid of these parasites (with no intellectual redeeming features, except looking glamous with thousand dollar outfits and costing the Australian Government millions of dollars to cover their "visits") Great for the UK - but not here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
he should be completly srtipped of all his priveliges and income (is any is from the taxpayer and including the Queens private purse (which is in reality from the taxpayer in essence) and shift somewhere with a change of name (perhaps Alaska) - but he's such a priviledged prick he won't do any such thing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []

Ha ! Bought his way out of trouble for being with someone he's never met, Lost his Royal title but We all know why he's not in Jail. He went to see his friend (Staying there for days, getting Foot Rubs & who knows what) who never was a "friend" to get the Blackmail footage back from Eipstein and the walk through the park was to make sure their conversation wasn't being recorded so he could say "either I get the underage Sex Tapes Back or they will find You Hanging in your Prison Cell 1 day / []
I did not believe  one word  that Virginia Roberts said on her first  time on tv       second  time  on tv  her story   was  was very different        her third  time on t v  her story was different  again      I believe Andrews  story  is the truth. / []
I will never tire of watching this interview, this has got to be my fifth or sixth viewing to date.  He couldn't lie his way out of a paper bag.  I love to see him squirm under interrogation.  Many times I expected him to throw a tantrum, "do you know who I am" or "I'm a Prince you can't speak to me like that".  He's a pathetic little man and  should have taken the advice not to do the interview.  Now pay up and shut up.  Respect and Love to all of the young women. / ['I have also watched it a few times - both to absorb the magnificent way she manages the interview and responds to him, and to try to understand why he thinks he is so above everything that happened. What is really fascinating is how at the end, when she thanks him, he smiles, obviously pleased with himself and how the interview has gone. He then gave her a tour of the palace!', 'Pay up? Fuck that he deserves jail time, and to be really honest these people deserve the death penalty, they’re all absolutely vile and you CANNOT cure these sick people , just get rid of them', "Wow, didn't know that.", 'I agree with you.', 'This!!']
He needs people to tell him NOT to hang out with a convicted pedo? This dude is disgusting.... / []

Absolute clear wrongness, I’ve now watched this around 10-12 times... it feels worse every time / []
This guy is a clownnn..wtf...and this guy is *royal*??hahahahahahahahhaha / []
Would've been better for him if he didn't do this interview cause he's guilty and now we all know it. / []
I like how he never saw the revolving door of teenage girls during the 4 days he stayed in Epstein's home _while_ breaking off their friendship. I would've at least said, *_"I was so drunk, I can't remember what was happening."_* He should've been arrested right after this interview. / []
Nothing struck him as "suspicious ",not any of the pornographic pictures in Epsteins house...didn't open his eyes to something being "off"? He's a terrible liar,but none the less still a liar! / []
Emily is absolutely brilliant. A genius. Well done Emily!  Bravo. Brilliant. / ['Umm how? She didn’t push back once on his BS. She just moved onto the next question. How is that genius?']

Powerful men using their wealth and connections to assault minors and mostly walk away from the law. This tale is as old as time honestly. Why people get so shell shocked is beyond me. Having a lot of money does not automatically equate to having good morals. Never has, never will. / []

Conspiracy of Silence is a documentary which was originally listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, and was to be aired on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada. At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed. A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved. / ["That's nuts. Available anywhere?"]
CRINGE / []
Such an untrustworthy and dislikable shit. / []
He is just so disgusting and arrogant! 🤮 / []
There's plenty of pictures of him sweating from this time. He's impossible to believe. / []
The ONE softball question she gives him ("Do you regret being friends with Epstein?") he immediately whiffs and says "nah" / []
Monarchy is obsolete and of no purpose in the 21st century. / []
What's sad is these people get away with things like this bec of the person he is his guilty it's written all over his face and ebstin got killed bec had he been arrested god only knows how many people were involed in this that he would have brang down with him so they had to get rid of him / []
This IS better watching for the 2nd time. He doesn’t sweat 😅 / []

I still can't believe this is real. / []
What a clown. / []
He's not a good liar. / []
He is a stammering idiot. Isn’t he…. / []
The only thing Andrew was probably guilty of, is being dumb enough to do this interview. Oof! / []
What, was he engaged to the kiddie diddler? Since when do you fly across the ocean to 'break up' with someone who "could not be defined as a very good friend at all"? I think the Queen would spring for a hotel room if her son is traveling overseas...so the reasoning for him staying at Epstein's house for any reason other than having sex with an underage girl is preposterous! / []
A cosmopolitan group of sweaty nonces! / []
Lying git / []
I think he should have just been honest and said yes I knew that man and his girlfriend. I knew a person who introduced me to new business contacts. We had contact regarding work over the years and I knew him, as I said, as a business man. Whatever he was doing in secret and hiding from the general public I had no idea from. As for staying in his home, it's a large mansion and we stay in certain parts of the mansion where we don't communicate if at all, perhaps for a dinner gathering. I have met many people.. perhaps I even slept with some but I would assume that they were of age and never would I personally ever, in my full capacity and honourable man, would have touched a minor. So all these allegations are demeaning and horrible and untrue.  But.. it seems he knew and chose to turn a blind eye. He perhaps benefited from many of the stays.  Its sad.. he should show remorse and accountability. I may be bold to assume that many rich people have taken advantage of their position. / []
Y LYIN 4 / []
Looks exactly like the interview rKelly did and he was obviously lying the whole time soo i mean :-) / []
He doesn’t give one f*** about the victims of his crime. On top of that, he is clearly stating he doesn’t recall, but as someone from the Royal family who is to help people trough charity, I find very unusual he is not trying to help the victims if is true he really did not know anything more as he is saying. / []
Love Prince Andrew. Love Kevin Spacey. / []
Of course he wouldnt remember Virginia! This would have happened so often that he wouldnt know Tracy from Sandra! / []
His eyes when questioned about the foot massage and meeting virginia. The worse acting ive ever seen! So uncomfortable to watch 🤢🤦‍♀️ / []

I don't mind the royal family never have but Andrew tut tut , And Charles  so close to Saville,  if your m8 was a wrong un u would know 100% what a crazy 🤪 world we live in / []
If he cut contact in 2006..why visit him in 2010 to tell him it was inappropriate for them to be seen together 🤷‍♀️😂😂 liar liar pants on fire Andy / []
“I’ve never Partied”  Yeah right ‘Randy Andy’ We are of the same age. I always called him a spunk. 70’s talk.  I liked him because of his spirited personality.  Andrew own your past. Honey you come across ridiculous. So sorry 🇦🇺 / []

He stay in his house to save taxpayers hotel bills!!! / []
"My problem is I'm *too* honorable..."  -- Oh for christ's sake... / []
Holy shit. It's as bad as everybody says it is. This dude is an interrogator's dream. There's a saying that goes "stop digging or you won't ever be able to get out of the hole". In this case, he just kept grabbing for the next shovel. Astoundingly un-self aware and aloof. He can't possibly believe that anyone DOESN'T see, quite plainly, that he is lying his ass off for most of this interview. A guy has got to know when to shut up. Any chance we can get him into a poker game? Guy's got no face at all. / []
This is so unbelievably tragic , I still can’t wrap my head around why he would even want to do an interview in the first place , I hope the world never forgets about this / ["He's a narcissist and probably a psychopath.

This is by far the most idiotic interview ive ever seen in my life. I bet the royal family is in question of his biological relations because his inability to be a remote convincing liar is evident… and i mean no disrespect to his mother but this is the dummest interview of all time. I mean call on prez Clinton for advice on how to deal with this or watch what the Clinton’s have done regarding Jeffrey Epstein…. / []
It's a Classic Cars Case for the wonderful BBC,..they assume a Target like The SAS in Action without any given intelligence or integrity only for one's mission to completely and Unprecedentedtly fail ! Good Luck Prince Andrew God Bless You  ! / []

If anyone has ever needed an example of male white privilege, look no further than the former HRH.

It’s completely irrelevant and not fair to other minorities.']
How come men are discusted with Amber hard who nobody can prove did something wrong or horrible but not with Andrew / ["We're disgusted with both. It is possible, you know."]
How cold heartedly this man is lying after every comment. People like these have little to no sympathy to what happened to those girls. / []
This is what happens when you’ve both power and money. As if he was walking blindfolded, which is absolutely ridiculous. He was a part on all this. Denial should not be the acceptance / ['We have a legal system for a purpose. Its job is to prove something happened "beyond all reasonable doubt". The only evidence against him appears to be a dodgy photo and the testimony of a prostitute. Hardly convincing.']
Some moments in this made me legitimately laugh out loud. How did this acting go unpunished ? Bloke should be locked up for life / ["He had sex with a 17 year old. Hardly a hanging offense. That's legal in alot of states."]
even if the accusations are fake he dug his own grave so bad / []

Why did he re-"act" so exaggerated "surprised", as Ms. Maitlis has mentioned the name of "Mr. Brockman"??? Just a few seconds later he protested, he wouldn´t know him at all!!! / []
How the people around him taught that it was a good idea to do this interview is beyond me. The man's a fool and has no right to have the privilege he has. / ['the privilege is what bred and nurtured this monster.']
Uhhmmmmm ,, urrrrrrrrrrrr / []
This is cringe-worthy. His biggest problem is that he isn't very bright. / []
how can anyone believe the news you put out when you protected one of the worst pedophiles in history for years. / []
The BBC has always protected pedophiles..and they did this interview to protect andrew..once this interview was done nothing would hold up in court. / []
This guy got some agreement with his accuser. Can’t imagine how evil both this guy and that girl would have to be that she gives hope to us by giving very credible account backed with a couple of pics and then get some sorta arrangement behind closed doors.   Now, we can never know the truth. I consider the accuser more evil cos she gave hope and took it away in the most pathetic way. / ['What do you mean?']
It was not a friendship at all from Epstein’s side, may be Andrew sincerely thought Epstein is his friend but not Epstein.  He used Andrew for his own needs, not even Andrew but his connections.  He just needed Andrew to open the doors for him. / []
Proceeds to pay £12m to a woman he claimed to have never met. Brilliant 👍🏼 / []

It took 4days to break up his friendship  with Epstein  he is such a devious  arrogant  and so unlikable so he doesn't  drink it doesn't  stop  him from buying others a drink he is such a pompous  fool he couldn't  even  say his children's  mother it had to be the Duchess. / []
Epstein  was a convicted  sex offender  but Andrew  didnt know the police was investigating  him  who else  could it possibly  be father xmas  such an idiot not the sharpest tool in the box. / []
The only reason for him to DENY everything is just his royal origin...and his fear of his mother!!! He would have done himself a favour...and would maybe win sympathy, when he had BALLS enough...(as a single man, with just little claim to the crown), to stand up for himself!!! But he did NOT!!! He just MESSED IT ALL UP unnecessarily...playing DUMB and trying to deny the obvious!!!  But there is ONE thing I believe him!!!    HE REALLY DOES NOT SWEAT!!!!! / []
I don’t believe him ,,,not one little bit ….his choice of words . …the tell …too eager  with his yep ……. / []
10 min into the interview u can already tell the man is lying period / []

Just imagine Virginia Roberts watching this interview. She must have thought Emily Maitlis was her greatest hero. What a terrific job she's done here / ["Well. I'm glad she had some justice before they killed her again."]
What was his "CRIME" again ?  I agree....He is the son of the british Queen...and he should have take care of his "Image"! But honestly... He never RAPED anyone...or forced it to do so!

What a boring, out of touch turd. Too stupid to know what he stepped into. You just know that he played with his boogers as a child. / []
I wonder what he thinks if harry and Meghan. And they of him. / []
At least possibly one of his daughters doesn't seem to believe hi. I forget which one but she has got involved with an women's refuge charity? / []
If he was more Maxwell's friend - you know - her plus one.  Why did he need to visit him?  It is an outrage that this punk thinks the British public are either so gullible or in awe of him that we believe a word that drips out of his mouth.  He is delusional.  So honourable that he needs to visit a paedophile - yeah right that is really honourable. / []
And to think he rubbed his hands together gleefully afterwards, telling his mother that the interview had gone well. / []
I wonder if,how much, money Andrew owed him. / []
I suppose we'll wait another 80 odd years to get the Queen to exonerate this veteran of the Falklands much like those exonerated in the Great War who were shot by a firing squad. Meantime tonight 24.4 million Nigerians are still homeless. / []
I love her! / []
I love when the interviewer asks “Do you think it was a good idea to stay at the house of a convicted sex offender?” 🤣🤣 / ['Look it was the honourable thing to do for his plus one non friend!

New definition of honor from British royalty. They were always full of shit… now its simply in the open']
I just don't see why this was a "disastrous" interview as is shrieked out everywhere ... I thought he was very honest and open. / ["Let me break this to you gently. There isn't A Father Christmas or An Easter Bunny.", '@stanstan7426 How hilarious.', '@lindason52 l Know.']
He's not just a sexual predators he's known as a common  thief stealing from the elderly  How disgusting is he / []
Pervert / []
Fabulous work by his majesty / []
A pedophile (15 Million quid harsh money says he is) Walks the queen to her seat a her husband ls memorial 🤣🤣🤣You could not make it up!!! / []
I think the BEST of all is the moment at, (13:42)! There is NO freaking Hollywood-Movie, being so entertaining like this!!! / []
He's a rat like the rest of the Royals. / []
Legend says he started with drinking, shortly after this interview!!! / []
How can you live with youre self. / []
Emily Maitlis should have headed the Partygate inquiry, Johnson would have been removed from office months ago. All the other issues, Covid Pandemic, Ukraine, plus the whole Tory party corruption and criminality scandals would be before the courts by now too.  It’s not what the Tories know, it’s who the Tories appoint to lead their inquiries 🥳 May 2022, Local Elections - Remember, Vote anyone, but, a corrupt & criminal Tory candidate. Pinocchio Johnson  Owen Patterson, Matt Hancock, Robert Jenrick, Geoffrey Cox And, of course, Dom the Con, Dominic Cummings - that SpecSavers marketing initiative for eye tests in Durham.  Please ad your own Tory criminal at will. There are so many corrupt Tories, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with all their names!

It's blatantly obvious he's lying.  He's repetitive, incredibly (but conveniently) 'forgetful' and tries to blindside difficult questions with a load of unecessary waffle.  His facial body language is also a dead giveaway.  And finally, the profuse "thank you very much" at the end.    But that aside, if he was genuinely innocent, he'd surely want his day in court and most certainly wouldn't have agreed to an out of court settlement.

RAPIST. PERPETUITY. / []
Someone falsely accuses you of a serious crime - what would you do…?  Give up your reputation, your job, a huge amount of money….? Or, would you fight the accusation with everything that you have…?  Common sense tells us that innocent people fight. The guilty do whatever’s necessary to get out of there and slink off into the shadows.   I don’t know how gullible you’d need to be to be taken in by Andrew’s little clown act above.   I guarantee you, if someone accused me of that kind of crime, I’d fight them in every court in the land. It’s utterly laughable to even consider giving them money.   Obviously, I’m not a lawyer, but when he says, “That photo is of upstairs in Ms Maxwell’s home, and I’ve never been upstairs in her home…”. the obvious question would be - how do you know it’s upstairs, if you’ve never been there…? Any 5-year-old with an ounce of common sense could catch him out in his lies. It’s embarrassing. / ["You fail to understand what a civil trial is.   A civil trial requires nowhere near a level of evidence of a criminal trial required for a guilty verdict, in fact it requires none.   No matter how innocent your are, it is trial by personality in the glare of the World's media circus.\n\nYou would have an emotional tearful woman who was trafficked by Epstein, a known ped0.  Her claim would be that she was sexually assaulted, but she will have NO evidence of that allegation.   The accused is a privileged buffoon who was a friend of said trafficker.  He can not prove it did not happen, because that is impossible.\n\nEven if innocent, what do you think the result of that civil trial would be?", 'I fully understand the differences between ‘civil’ and ‘criminal’ proceedings. Let me summarise for you - criminal proceedings require the prosecution to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’. Civil proceedings are driven by the ‘balance of probability’ - for example, is it more likely than not. \nAnd yes, levels of proof are STILL required. \nThe ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ test is difficult because -\n1. It’s a ‘he says, she says’ case. \n2. Maxwell is saying nothing at the moment, but may well change her mind in future. \n3. Andrew has taken on the defence of the new ‘no comment’ - ‘I don’t remember’ - the last refuge of the ‘guilty’. \nAndrew now finds himself in Jimmy Savile territory - ‘getting away with it’. There’s no way he was getting into a witness box. Not even his expensively-assembled legal team would have been able to protect him. And, he knows it.', "@tinamac2380 \nAt least you've now Google'd the difference, well done.\n\nThere is no point going to trial and have your private life exposed to the media circus.  You know that it will be trial by media, you WILL lose because it is based on personalities.  The common sense direction is to settle regardless of innocence or guilt.\n\nQuite why you are unable to grasp this simple point is a mystery.", 'Random Task -\n\nOh dear. Lashing out with insults. \n\nNo. I don’t need to ‘google’ the difference between ‘criminal’ and ‘civil’. I’m not a lawyer, but my profession takes me into court on a regular basis. And ‘law’ makes up for a quarter of my Honours Degree and Masters. So, yes, I have a working knowledge of the law - I know that fact will probably upset you further, but that’s your problem, not mine. Best just to end this conversation here. Have a good life.', '\u200b@tinamac2380 \nYour "Honours Degree and Masters" clearly has not taught you presumption of innocence, the very corner stone of our justice system.\n\nPerhaps you should get a refund?']
Why didn’t she broach the subject of Epstein’s reasons for the plaignant’s employment in his set-up?  She was employed by him ie on his staff role as precisely what? As an entertainer, hostess or what?  How really innocent was she or was she really and truly so gullible? And if so what of her parents’ absence of any responsibility?  How many months in total had she « known » Epstein and/or Maxwell in relation to her being in paid employment of either of them?  As a young girl innocent of the wider world and all its lack of scruples how come she was « swept along «  with so much ease without her having any inner thoughts and dreams of any kind of sex relationship within the period of difference between her coming of legal age of consentment?  If she was an « unwilling virgin » and conscience of herself being so then also unconvincing she believed she wouldn’t be bonked sooner or later in that atmosphere, or was her ploy of girlish naivety the best to pursue with all the risks to hold on to the not ungenerous gains and life-style?  To take a hypothetical example as to law ethics…how really guilty and damnable would a smart arse  character be who encourages a far less partner in their joint crimininal ventures to kill a policeman in their way threatening their freedom, knowing that if caught he would escape guilt because he still a minor but his partner would take the full consequences of the law because older by a few months and not legally a minor… such a case happened in England and capital punishment took place fo the elder and arguably the more dim-witted of the pair ie he did the foul deed and ought to have known better, but the other one escaped execution because of a few months his junior.   Whither the fairness of Justice?  Maybe the Law should say something about her ways of earning her living?  What exactly is her profession and where did she learn it?  PA is not the brightest of shining lights not to say electric light bulbs, and one may well suppose there are many once upon a time humiliated when in their young years earning a few measly bucks as a cloakroom attendent or cleaning out the dirty toilets left in disgustingly by those who should know better in some many bathroomed mansion down monty-chiot way,  but as the Bard once proclaimed « the Law is an ass! » And about time it got its act right!   Eh Secoulas?  How strange this Virginia never mentions any conversations about her work, talks with girlfriends, fellow colleagues, her father…as to how her life-style and earnings were fast improving and thanks to what cerebral attainments or just flair or beautiful looks?  Was it so different in Hollywood, just not knowing the right people maybe? / []

He denied too much. He was no close friend, not on a Party. What the hell did he there 😂🤦 / []
What about: Bill Clinton Bill Gates... Jail them all 🤓 / ['Donald Trump was well, don’t forget', "@mylerwilson4879 trump is not involved in sex only building property \nDon't forget the Bidens especially Joe Biden perversion. And Hunter is just a preditor", '@epcode5121 He still had connections to Epstein the same Clinton and Gates did, and Biden’s son being a predator doesn’t change that. And Trump himself got sued for raping women so like… he’s not different', '@mylerwilson4879 your obviously a Woke Drone\nMake America great again\nTrump for president 🙏']
He cant recall???? how many young girls or child had he slept with? If he really doesnt remember then He must have lost his sex numbers. Because big logic is that He says having sex is positive thing and man cant forget it. That s his main philosophy.  then, if someone slept with a young adult sometime in his/her lifetime, then that number must be very very small compared to all sex opportunity numbers in your entire life. At least you sure will remember HAD or  NOT with a child 👧. Just ask a simple question that if he had a sex with a child in his entire life??? Easy one. He cant even make a logic in his explanation. How can you not remember one of your positive experiences specially with a child ???? You cant remember specially in your age????? Is this person already over 100 years old??😂😂 / ['She was 17, above he legal age of consent.  Get a grip!']
You can say by the look of his face the scare and lie / []
He says they were not very close friends but than talks as if he knows him so well saying "I never saw Epstein with a camera"  than goes on to say I have never been upstairs but how do u know its upstairs if u have never been there ??? / []
non stop lying! ugly w-Bastard!  @48:03 Prince Andrew:  "do i regret the fact that that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming yes"  Reporter: unbecoming?…he was a sex offender!  Prince Andrew:  I'm sorry I'm I was being polite,  yes he was a sex offender / []
He’s a shocker / []
He doesn't have any recollection ... give me a break.. really..WOWWWW.  He knows that he knows / []
"Tendancy to be, too honorable" LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []

The man is a first class idiot 🤬🤬🤬🤬 / []
Wonder how long it took This Turd to put his Alibi together LoL / []
"That stretch was a bit of a stretch." / []
If you play Prince Andrew's part(s) on 1.50x -1.75x speed, he actually sounds super confident and like he's telling nothing but the truth, HOWEVER 22:00 just destroyed his credibility right away - no matter what you do. / ['Yes I didn’t sweat at the time. Remembering what he was told to say. So true! 22:03']
‘No I wasn’t having a foot massage, I hadn’t got feet at the time’ / []
Pathetic. / []
Hello, thank you for this video................ oh dear Prince Andrew can’t look any more guilty than what he does in this interview...............kim🇬🇧     Andrew, you’re disgusting🤮 / []
Did anyone else notice that he claims that he can’t remember the girl at all… While also claiming he doesn’t remember taking a photo in the “upstairs rooms of the house?”  He can glance at the photo and instantly know exactly which room he was in… While having total memory loss of the girl. How ironic. Selective amnesia. / ['If the photo is fake you would still recognise the room used as the background if somebody had already told you that it was one of the upstairs rooms the fake was used for.\n\nHad I said to you that is the upstairs room in that photo, you would know it was when asked later by somebody else.']
There are some questions you just don't want to know the answers to. / []
What's Andrews official religion?  Let's blame his religion 👍🏻 / []
One thing rich people are, they are terrible liars. They get away with things so much and get so many people to lie for them that they are horrible at it themselves. So easy to catch them out when they don’t have their lawyers and security with them. / []
If Andrew was innocent why did he paid Virginia Roberts 10 million USD as hush money to not continue the trail. / []
"Tendency to be to honorable" Get out the guillotines / []
i've never cringed so hard in my life. how can he keep a straight face spewing all those lies 😂 / ['X45😱']
You seem utterly convinced you're telling the truth. LOL / []
Why look surprised about the name John brockman litery agent if u don't no the person as he claims / []
He comes across as such a belithering idiot he reminded  Emily he lives  in Buckingham palace as if she didn't know. / []
He ceased  contact  but he went back for more thinking this would never come to light and bite his rear end. / []
Old Andy never went to university  not enough  up top pretty dense thick as 2 short planks as described  by his naval colleagues  and very much despised  by them seen as arrogant and pompous. / []

judge i am afraid that you are wrong! i am Innocent because at the time i was not able to sweat..... dafug / []
This guy is hilarious 😂 / []
LMAO LIAR LAIR LIAR / []
"I never really have partied." This whole interview was like a parody with a prince Andrew impersonator. / ['The way he says “partied” almost like it’s a disgusting swear word', 'Yes', 'In his case, it is. @cheryl467']
All boils down to Bitcoin's chief architect in HEX: CC DE DD DF / []
Cringy... Dirty...Old... Lying... Disgusting... Man 🤮 / []
He even speaks like a predator. The way he uses that tone of voice, his overly confident answers and the way he’s manipulated the truth. I would love to know what the queen thinks of all this. She must be so ashamed / []
The amount of holes he dug himself in this interview is a historical moment in itself.   “That photo was taken upstairs and I’ve never been upstairs”. So how did you know that photo was taken upstairs. Also how did you know that photo was taken at all if you keep saying it’s a fake photo lol 😂.   “We were never close” But he stayed at his home and threw parties and went to dinner parties with them  “I can’t sweat” 🤥 omg 😂   “That’s not my arm around her because  public displays of affection is something I don’t do” lol 😂 lie!   “I’ve never been to tramp nightclub because I don’t drink” 🤥   “I had to fly to Jeff’s place just to tell him that we can’t be friends anymore” But you said at the beginning of the interview that you were never friends and never close. But you felt the need to fly all the way to him to tell him that lol. Why not just a plain and simple phone call if that was the case. Lol idiot.   The lies coming out of his mouth is insane and he is even trying to convince himself that they are true. Wow 😂 / []
Yep so basically guilty.... / ['Of what?']
I am not defending this shxtbag but amazing how woman fxck now sue later & play virgin ??? We have all seen it ??? Andy was best mates with Jimmy Savile. This puke would have had your daughter guttered if she fell pregnant ??? These are your loyal family if you have vulnerable children that can be sexually abused ? Aires to your piss-ant throne that no law can touch ??? / []
If he can't remember being upstairs where photo was taken how would he not that it was a upstairs room / []
I don’t know where the bar is 😂 / []
a true nut job that helps run a country / []
train wrecking, and plane crashing, into a cruise ship in very slow motion.  exquisite. / []
“Four times a year” haha this guy I seriously cannot believe he did this interview. / ['Andrew : I did not go there 4 times a year\nEmily :how many times did u go? \nAndrew : 4 times\n\n😂😂😂']
Watching Andrew exchanging feet in his mouth sounds like Casp47 (Casper the dog) trying to make his dad understand that he didn't know how Daisy got locked in the cupboard. / []
Why isn't he behind bars ?? / []
Randy Andy lies like a trooper. A $10,000,000 truth. / []
The biggest Liar since Tam Pepper :-( . / []
DEAR GOD, A RICH WHITE MAN THAT LIKES LITTLE KIDS... IT'S A GOOD THING WE FOUND OUT SO WE CAN PUT A STOP TO IT BEFORE IT SPREADS!   NEXT IT COULD BE SHIEKS, PRIESTS, PRESIDENTS WHERE WILL IT END? THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND EXPOSE THIS LIE, KEEP IT CONTAINED TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WHERE IT BELONGS. / []
It is always entertaining to watch a Idiot who thinks they are cleaver put a rope around there own neck. / []
See the mofo sweating! No empathy for the victims, looking all sus / []
And he just gave her $20 million to settle this. Enough said lol / []

You could tell by the look in his eyes he is so full of shit .and he trying to remember his own lies. / []
Lol shame on the birtish family I've always know they were creepy af. The queen looks like a real life bat for Christ sakes. / []

Priceless !! / ['I know I watch it periodically for a good laugh!', 'I come back to watch it when my life is good n the toilet, it makes me feel better. I will never be this big of a looser.', 'he looked so uncomfortable when making his "i dont sweat" claims...', 'Same here,  simply hilarious!!', 'Same hahaha']
she baited him well, but was easy catch. how stupid can one look, cant the royal family afford a spin doctor, or at least an adult... funny shit to watch but / []

Absolutely sweating / []
Great interviewer, he’s such a plonker 🤣 / []
Paedo Prince escapes justice with mommy's checkbook. / ['She was 17 so above the legal age of consent.', '@random6809 Yet Mommy paid $16MILLION for his sexual assault. Hmm', '@burningmanmike \nWhich has got nothing to do with your nonsense ped0 comment.  You are wrong, she was 17.']
He did not know Jeffrey Epstein was trafficking underage girls to famous people like himself... but he goes and pays allegedly $20 million USD to Virginia Dufresne to settle the lawsuit... Yeah, makes no sense buddy... when were you dishonest then? Then, Now, when? / []
Having watched it for a 3rd time now - I'm interested in what his body language reveals when answering uncomfortable questions. I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure he lies frequently during this interview. Apparently he subsequently commented that he thought it went well. He's obviously not the sharpest tack in the box / []
“If you’re a man, it is a positive act to have sex with somebody” Wow / []
He's just too honourable. And that's all. / []
Omg...this is hilarious watching him try to clear his name and failing miserably 😂 / ['😅😂']
Maybe he’s drink was spiked every time he went there / []
What a doofus.  Nice try, throwing Maxwell under the bus. / []
“Yeah no there’s no way that story is real, back in those days I didn’t sweat at all” / []
Wish I had mates like Epstein an ghislane . Damn / []
Well I think it's safe to say he's full of shit. / []
He is so full of shit. / []
Prince Andrew needed a good  humanitarian cause to be involved in  This would.help his morality and integrity.  He would be better off.if he could do some good for people  who need their lives improved.  He needs to think of other people and not his immoral needs.  It would.have been good if his thoughts would been turned away  from his corrupt lifestyle into worthwhile projects.  It seems his life is meaningless and he has nothing worthwhile to do with his time.  He very likely is obsessed with himself and his perceived needs which are so immoral that he could never be happy.  People.have turned their lives around and they would.not have been people of privilege where power and money  were at their fingertips.  It was  probably easier for much less privileged people to change their lives than this spoilt child like man could.  He really.does need to grow.up and take responsibility for his life but does he want to? Please Prince Andrew, give some serious and mature thought to what you.have done and the respect  you.have lost and also the disgrace you have brought upon the Royal Family.  You can make amends, but only.if you are truly repentant and wish to make your life worthwhile, pursuing goals that have.integrity,  honesty and morality. I wish you all the best in changing your life. / []
Absolute trainsmash / []
So he stays at his friends house to break up with him. Its like a train station with people coming and going. He has security for the walk in the park. Security must have been concerned for his safety with so many strangers coming and going from the place. They didn't warn him there were young women visiting the house? Too many holes in this story. / []
Good to know it's not just the USA that's fcked up! We've finally got something to unite all of us.  Our Gov'ts are more messed up than we'll ever be! / []
Full of shit from start to finish much like most royal families / []
I hope this interview stays available to wake up more ppl… / ['oh look the queen and her husband have disapeared']
My God this lady is the Joe Kenda of interviewers!! / []
The photograph was for black mail / []
Absolute liar! He went to break the friendship then goes to have a meal with him. Does he think we are fools? What a liar! Railway station?!?! Ep House was a peodo pad. / []
I have come to realize what great parents I have.   When I was growing up and did something wrong, my parents punished me instead of making excuses.   I was held to an honorable standard.   This man had two daughters at the time so he had to have the capacity to judge how old these trafficked girls were.   For him to be the head of an organization that was supposed to be raising awareness on child trafficking but "he didn't see anything odd" is astounding. / ['Because at that time before "ME TOO " era  17 years olds considered old enough and not  minor for orgy . He ment he haven\'t seen  " kindergarten kids " been abused  around at Epstein\'s houses....', "The royal family don't have children, they only have offsprings to continue the line.", 'From memory he stated that he had grown up with servants so he didn\'t notice anything ! For "Randy Andy"  not to notice young girls in very little clothing hanging around ...', "Yup that bit really stood out. What stands out the most is the acting shocked at Virginia deposition. Not a chance he wasn't already aware off her deposition. He's apparently not too intelligent. But he clearly thinks we aren't, or he's less intelligent than it is thought. That why tf would he act totally shocked. Just like the clear fake shock when John Brockman was mentioned.\nThe guy spent 4 days with a some1 convicted off SA. Apparently to be honourable (lol literally). But sat at a dinner party with him. You couldn't make this up.\nSays it all really when the reason he was not gonna stay friends wasn't- I don't want a SO as a friend, it was cos there's scrutiny on me. So what if no one had cared they'd have stayed friends. \nSo clear he's never been held to account for anything, clearly the opposite. I'm kinda glad now my mum didn't take my crap lol. Didn't know where the bar was lol. Same place as any club the huge thing with 100s off bottles off drink that you see within walking 10ft in..", 'Just baffling isn’t it.']
He decided to speak because he's an arrogant pompous liar who thought people would believe anything he said because he's a prince!!!   What an idiot. Made a complete fool of himself and he thinks it was a triumphant interview....   lol / []
The fool is more offended at being accused of sweating than having sex with underage girls. / []
This is so embarrassing to match! he is so bad at lying. / []
Car crash responses. How the queen must be feeling after watching him dig deeper holes / []
obviously jeffrey epstein was a child sex trafficker for the Elite such as Prince andrew and friends e.g clinton and trump so what happens to the rest of these MOFOS  nothing. the world is run by pedophiles e.g royal monarch the presidency and the vatican.. the queen and pope are very cosy. these laws they make only apply to the people not them / []
He is just a parasite. According to news he is rude to his servants. I wonder if he can clean his own ass. I feel pity for those people who must serve him. / []
This guy is a piece of trash… he and Epstein raped all these women excuse me these little girls and nothing is being done to this predator? Seems as though he can’t be touched but he didn’t have a problem touching on little girls. He flew all the way to new York had a walk in the park with him to tell him that he no longer wanted to be friends and yet he stayed days later at his crib… why isn’t this animal arrest yet? / []
All the work you do. He's never done a day's work in his life  😂 / []
BS / []
First Class interview. / []
This man should be in prison / ['For what?']
how the tyrant wiggles through his lies but we have to remember that the whole Royal Family have been extremely immoral for centuries and Ebstein cant be blamed for all that,..... so we need to remember that the men and women in this Royal family have been extremely immoral for centuries !........ / []
Full of  shit / []
He is such an Honorable Guy 😜... / []
This is the 4th or 5th time I've watched this It's just so bad I love to come back and remember 😂😂😂 / []

A shooting weekend !! you mean shooting innocent animals. I never liked this man and never will. / []
Everytime i failed my work interview, i watch this and gain my self confidence back / ['😂😂😂😂😂']
when he said, 'That picture was taken upstairs, I've never been upstairs'. He said that twice.. meanwhile how do you know the pic was taken upstairs if you've never been upstairs and you don't recall it being taken???? He is so guilty. I see though men like him. / ['Exactly what I was thinking!']
The Prince is innocent!! / ['He is Guilty as Hell']
his mom has so much power that they will make this allegations go away...just like they did with the Harry and Meghan interview with Oprah. He's lying through his teeth. Ask Fergie...lol / []
Even if it happened, how would he know she wasn't 18?  Ask 4 a drivers license.  Guffrie has a tax exempt charity.  The money she collects from these guys is tax exempt.  She lives in Australia but keeps a store front in the USA. If u investigated it's one room or closet with a repeating answer machine.  I know cause I investigated these kinds of things.  Total bunk / []
i stay at his homes but not we are not good friends / []
There were at least 5 times he could of so easily distanced himself, BUT  said “my advisers/legal team say”. This is the times he shot himself in the foot and gave his guilty secrets away. Who the fuck takes 4 days to say we should not seen together or be associated with each other!!!! Sorry but guilty and more importantly A guilty person doesn’t pay off their accuser! / []
Randy Andy got caught / []
I watch this every so often to show myself I'm relatively normal... / []
THE CLOWN PRINCE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
35:15 that faint "look" going off his lips HAHAHAHAHAHAH / []
It would've been less embarrassing for him to just confess to everything. / ['@Burr Anderson right?

It was impossible for Prince Andrew to have molested any woman. Because his adrenaline during the war, had turned his penis into a vagina. / []

If I was setting an event for the royals and he was there, I’d make sure it was unbearably hot, pretend the aircon had failed and then get a picture of him sweating. / []
Why so nervous Prince you're stumbling on your own words Prince you're answering questions before she finish asking them and it's making you look foolish because that wasn't a question she asked Prince maybe you should shut up Prince / []
I don’t envy the person doing the interview . She did an outstanding job! / ['Why would you envy her ?', '@causetheplumstasteyum7848 fr']
He belongs to a country filled of perverted, liar and insane people. / ['As do you, so what?']
“I never sweat on the 11th of March” is an insane thing to say / ["He say in this interview that he got treatment and now he sweats he stumbles over his words so it was hard to pick up but it's in the same sentence as when he said he couldn't sweat"]
Virginia Roberts doesnt look abused in the picture. She looks very happy.  I wonder what deals went wrong for her. Or maybe they just didn't call her back as often as she expected or was promised. / ['The voice of Jeffrey from the grave']
This just tells rapists that it's OK to rape, most sex crimes committed by people like this beast are protected and money is paid to keep it quiet look at Jimmy Savile / ['Do you have any evidence that he raped her?', '@random6809 £12,000,000 worth of evidence,  or perhaps he just liked her.

i guess royalty is just a tittle because of ordinary human tendencies . pedophilia might be generational but money  makes it easy to settle  case from going to court ....and i thought royalty was above any  criminal tendencies but i was wrong.wow ! first finding out religions are lie and now this.. what a disappointment . / ['What pedophilia?

Leaked video uploaded to YouTube of Prince Andrew "preparing himself"  https://youtu.be/SRbXj8D_YA4 / []
He was photographed with a girl he claims to have never met.  The photo was taken in what he confirmed to be the upstairs at Ghislaine Maxwell's London home, despite also claiming he'd never been upstairs in the house.  So, he settles out of court over the issue of not meeting a girl in a place he's never been.  Okay, I get it.  My brain doesn't hurt. / ["Most civil cases here in the States are settled without actually going to court. What I want to know is why, when offered by the U.S. Attorney's office, she did not file a criminal complaint against Andrew.

Then, he would have had to come to New York City to answer them!", 'I think he meant the photo was confirmed by someone else to be taken upstairs, but he hasn’t been upstairs.', 'Photo was photoshopped']
Liar, liar, pants on fire / []
It was a stretch to say we were ‘close friends’ 🤣🤣🤣 / []
the royal family for sure knows what Andrew was doing and they are in some shady crap also.   they killed princess Diana that is why harry got out of that family life. / []
IF PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT DO THE THINGS THE 17 YEAR OLD GIRL CLAIMED HE DID THEN I WOULD THINK HE WOULD FIGHT TO THE BITTER END AND NOT SETTLE OUT OF COURT BECAUSE HIS ENTIRE LIFE IS BEING DESTROYED BY THIS AND IF HE IS NOT GUILTY THEN WHY SETTLE $20 MILLION USD ?????

Strange how most of his answers are “I don’t remember” but when she asked him about the photo of him with his arm around Virginia he straight away said “I NEVER saw Epstein carrying a camera!” What a complete lying dirty filthy scum bag. He couldn’t have made it any more obvious that he was talking complete Bull 💩. / []
The denying and not recalling of “prince” Andrew is so incriminating. He is definitely guilty. It is just so unfortunate that he (the British tax payers) have to pay for the millions of the civil case. Why is there no criminal case? This and also the drama with Harry and Megan shows how obsolete it is to have a monarchy which is being financed by the working population and their taxes. In my opinion there is no more monarchy  needed. It is better if the British people have to pay less taxes. / ['Well said 👏👏', '@bellaharrison6202 thank you 🙏', 'What is he guilty of?']

Prince Andrew is STUPID not to tell the world the truth. NEXT TIME HIRE ME TO BE HIS LAWYER...Was the girl forced to have sex NO was she kindapped NO...was she threathened to have sex NO....( she went to have sex beliving she will get a position in the Queen circle) when she was not needed anymore she was hurt and called Police for WHAT....? Nothing happened there, no criminal acts not force toward her from anyone. She knew what she was going to do for those men...She had a choice to stay with them or leave..SHE WAS NOT KIDNAPPED OR HELD BACK AGAINST HER WILL.   WTF STUPID PRINCE TO PAY HER $12M.....DUMB thing to do....( might as well sue a black man who sits beside you on the bus saying that you truly beleived that HE WILL ATTACK YOU and you were in fear...) / []
He’s GUITLY & paid that woman off! & the Queen is funding it! Disgusting 🙌🏼 / []
This reminds me of the entitlement that the 1% have behind closed doors… they think they can do whatever they want and don’t ever think they will be sitting down doing a 60 minute interview / []
I’m wondering why he just wouldn’t say “Yes, I did have relations but I thought she was 20”….and deal with that oppose to lying about ever knowing or taking a pic with her! I’d be more prone to believe he had sex with someone he thought was over 18 then this BS he spitting / ['At the three specified locations she was over the age of consent anyway!']
He doesn’t sweat…lizards don’t sweat / []
I feel sorry for this man loosing his ,honour because of money deal from women they ran to search for easy money , because is disgusting bribery and brainwashed,World leaders we living in the Country and Nations that controlling by criminal laws that destroyed innocent people men because of their money,and wealth,ruining around selling their selves and after they cried out for money ,I don't think so that is the most prejudice reaped off, dirty business that destroying the Country and Nations, My word of Wisdom stop these game of holiwood, cunning hungry women that destroyed good men for their own business and investment / []
His next job should be a comedian....best interview / []
Disgraceful / []
What a pervert .. can’t believe he said he went shooting with Epstein shooting and killing poor innocent animals disgraceful ..Poor queen to have this as a off spring / []

He was friends with Gesabell not Epstein. All his invitations were to his friend Gesabell plus one. So how many men feel the need to "break up" in person with a child molester who really wasn't "your" friend. Oh Andy, your dead. You've just buried yourself. / []
Wait in 2010 when he "broke up" with Epstein he stayed at Epstein's home for four days because of convenience and safety measures could be obtained because of his royal status but, many people were coming and going all the time... And if he did go there to "break up" because of Epstein's role with young girls and Epstein agreed the last thing that would be happening is more girls. Prince Andrew was my favorite but he has shown a disgusting dirty lying side of himself that is unforgiveable. / []
For sale one used Duke - never sweats and believes his own hype. New owner must know how to arrange soft toys.  Apply to Windsor Castle. Good luck you’ll need it! / []
GET THIS PERVERT ON THE LIE DETECTOR I BET HE WILL START SWEATING THEN💯 / []
Emily helped Andrew open more than the FBI or police here were able to because he was allowed to avoid their questioning & was protected by his police bodyguards tax payer funded & by mummy queen.anyone else surely would be charged with harbouring a wanted felon.no one else wanted for under age allegations of rape would be treated this kindly.why are these royals so protected.look up  Norman bakers insight to England's answer to the Mafia "firm". / []
It's such a shame really as it shows that some in royalty/ intelligent posts can be thick. Always tell your children to see and understand others. However this interview told us normal people/middle/working class that we are actually very intelligent. This interview was a definite warning for us all that being accepted into the upper echelons universities and certainly the officer course in our forces that we are all extra special and that these idiots that are being portrayed as role models. Is exactly the reason that us everyday people are OK. God help us all. What idiots have we let be as role models. Laughable. / []
A straight forward shooting weekend. 😂. Yeah like we all do that. / []
This is the best car crash interview I have seen. Every line is an absolute gem. Shooting party birthday party. Absolutely no indication.. the trouble is I am just too honourable. More like burn all the emails quick. / ['"Car crash interview" IS the best word for this interview! Exactly! 👏']
I personally think he is guilty by association as he is a spoilt chap. One rich upper echelon bloke followed another one. For most of us I should imagine in England it isn't the fact he may of slept with a 17 year old as that is legal here. When  I was 17 in 1990 we had lots of older men come on to us. My 16 year old daughter tells me often of the car horns etc that go off when she is walking home from work etc. For us  It's the fact that a member of the royal family was so stupid to liaise with a man who most people knew at the time was trafficking young women and probably boys to an island and then denies it. It's about protecting each other and protecting our youth from the trafficking industry. When people say oh well she was 17 so legal. That's not the issue. It's that these girls who came from poor and disruptive family backgrounds were touted purposely to act as sexual slaves to these mega rich men and women where they thought they would feel special, loved and cherished. They were exploited because of their background. Millions still are being exploited, sadly far younger. A man or woman of experience earning money from those who suffer in this way is gross. It is not right. This is not who we should be as a society. The world could be such a beautiful place. But is not because hu.ans are weak and stupid. / []
Bull shit / []
And the sweating thing never heard so much bullshit in all my life / []
He is such a bad liar, He went to Pizza Express in Woking yet not a single person came forward ? Come on, a Royal in a Pizza shop, no matter what day it is, anyone in there would recall a Prince came in, he is such a rude and arrogant Prince so it must be easy to rememeber. / []
This is the best stand up comedy I've ever seen wonder if Prince Andrew will do any tours / ['Only to epstiens island', '@OfficialRedd 😂', 'Now that he is officially out of a job, doing comedy tours based on this interview would be an employment option', 'He might even beat Norm in a comedy stand off.

It didn’t happen because: - he couldn’t sweat - he was eating pizza that night - he never went upstairs at Ghislaine’s house - he wears a suit when he goes out in London, so the picture couldn’t have been taken in London because those are his “travelling clothes” - he doesn’t “party” - he doesn’t drink - he doesn't know where the bar is at Tramp nightclub - he doesn’t engage in public displays of affection - if you’re a man sex is a “positive act”, therefore he would remember if he’d had it - he has no memory of meeting Virginia Roberts. The one reason that he did not mention: - it couldn’t have happened because he would never, ever have sex with a trafficked, underage girl. / ['Underrated comment']

I just saw now this interview. I have nothing to do with the UK or the Royal Family, but seen now what the whole episode is end, It's clear to me now , that he was use. How can a woman, who was a victim of "human traffic" just want to get money and not justice? Thats not possible, in my mind. This whole episode probably do have something to do with some kind of "gualicho argentino" :) for him come here to the Falkland/Malvinas war, back in 1982. Because listen this interview now? I do believe he is speaking the truth. Is totally impossible that he was in Epstein house without any "security" person next to him, so is totally impossible that the young girl take a photo camera with her, and ask to someone: "hey! can you take us a selfie"? This is not possible. / ['Too early for Christmas you fruitcake. Of course he’s honourable, a gentleman with the utmost integrity.']

In the Netflix Epstein documentary a guy who dealt with the internet at Epstein's private island saw Andrew rubbing up against his victim. Now he's paid her 12 Million to keep the lid on it till after the Queens celebrations. He's convinced enough to pay her to avoid court. All the Queen's hard work and her to eldest have pretty much killed the Monarchy either after the Queen retires or after Prince Charles. I think they might survive a couple more monarchs if Prince Charles isn't made King and it goes  to Prince William because thankfully he seems like The Queen and hasn't real had any scandals. That might be the only way the Monarchy could survive after the Queen eldest children's complete disrespect of there position / []

The interview was a car crash!! He made himself look guilty He lives in his own world does not know how the real world  works plus he is entitled and self serving  Now he's  in discgrace and bringing down the royal family and threatening the health of the queen Great work Andrew !!! NOT !! ☹️ / []

Emily was outstanding in this interview. She was fair in her line of questioning, set up an undeniable historical narrative with a laser like precision in her quest for the truth. She is always cleverly probing to let Andrew set his own booby traps. Now we know that he settles out of court for 12 million with someone he’s never met?

No one straightened his tie…… / []
Tried by the media, found guilty by hateful people and executed by foreign extortionists. If Andrew was dancing at Tramp with a young woman dozens of patrons , staff and management would remember the occasion and possibly take photos. Where are these numerous witnesses?  He was taken down by fake friends and a lying fortune hunter prostitute  with photoshopping friends. / []
Pilloried by unjust societal hypocrisy and inappropriate teenage regret. / []
Prince is fool. Why he not saying the lady was his gf.  So with gf how it’s can be sexual harassment! And  if so why she not report at that time. And why now.    It’s just simple to understand that she need money from prince and she has influences by someone / []
wonder how many more girls there are out there that he took advantage of..I love that journalist / ['She was 17 and above the age of consent.   Do you have evidence that he, "took advantage of" her?']
Where were the parents when this was happening? / ['Maybe they had no parents, broken homes?. The honourable Andrew did nothing unbecoming. Except lose two full loads that we know of. As in settlement payments.']
Pathetic,   God have mercy / []
I would honestly be more likely to believe him if he hadn't denied any and all interaction with trafficked women. Like you don't think to ID your masseuse to see if they are over age if you're at a beach house and offered a massage from an employee of someone you have a networking relationship with, you are probably just going to accept the offer, get a massage and move on without really thinking of it. Him denying this even being a possibility comes off very scripted / []

Not only Andrew is so unintelligent but also so extremely unaware of it… he looks so arrogant and truly believed he fooled everyone. Priviledged people often think they are the smartest not realizing the respect they enjoy is inherited and not earned by any achievement. I other words, besides his obvious stupidity he is disgusting. / []
Paid her off… didn’t see that coming! / []
Today was a good day 😌 ☺️ thank you mummy 😘 I knew I was innocent / []
So today we hear that he is going to be paying that lady an out-of-court settlement of around £10 million basically to keep her quiet. She has agreed to take accept the money. So, I think we can safely say, yes, he did have sex with her (she was 17 back then) so in this interview, he lied through his teeth! God knows how much the Queen is paying!?! / ['How’s she keeping it quiet, it’s all over the news you idiot']

Also this is not a unique experience this sort of behaviour is going on with the Royal family for many many many generations the only difference is now we are all armed with cell phones CCTV and other recording devices which makes it very difficult to deny / []
After this video I hope someone high up in the royal family held him to account for the content of this interview, someone he could not just dismiss,  Hope prince William and his dad were involved in stripping him of his public duties,  A man who had the world at his feet, silver spoon in his mouth from birth, could of chosen any people to be friends and spend time with and again he chose to hang out with a registered sex offender, he would of none, MI6 would of looked Epstein up and he would of been told,  Andrew deserves everything that comes his way,  He has settled out of court, for between 6 and 12 million pounds,  Karma is true Andrew, / []
Perv needs to go jail / []
So he's just done an out of court settlement with someone who he's never spent time with the photos were fake he has being saying he wants he's day in court to clear he's name but instead he hands over a good few million pounds for someone he has never met / []
🤣🤣🤣 WAFFLEING / []
Love how he claims he cannot sweat but flushed and obviously if you touched him perspiring during some of these questions, I am American so not really into the Monarchy thing, however, I assume someone coaches them on interviews?

What’s the problem? She was over 18 and looked happy enough in the photo. / []
After the "+-12m pound settlement.." I am back here now to make a comment. Madam Emily Maitlis, you the best investigative reporter who needs a trophy on this particular case.

Keep it up Madam Emily Maitlis. As mothers of girl-children we can't stand this abuse.  Be Blessed. / []
Who is here after the 12 million pound settlement to a woman he "never met" / ['£12 million to someone that he never met ..... 36:31 clearly the advice was NOT to do so, and also pay your way out of this!']

We will never know exactly what happened between them but paying her $Millions in hush money is proof that whatever it was was very damaging to him and the royal family and that he does not want it aired in public! / []
Well, he is certainly sweating now. / []
I see that he's just settled out of court with his accuser.... Why?  If he was truly innocent he'd fight this all the way through the courts. / ['This https://youtu.be/Rq3Zb3AghBE😂💙😂💙', "That is a bit naive, if you don't mind me saying. Being innocent is not enough, you need to be able to prove it. Either way to my mind he is guilty if not in partaking in Epstein's goodies - then turning a blind eye to it and hanging out at a sex traffickers house. Whether he had sex with  underage girls or not, he probably just has to finish it off by paying off the victim esp in the year of the Jubilee. His mum would have told him to cap it off and gave him the money to do so. The  Royal family are a joke, the sooner we get rid of them the better."]
In my opinion the man is a liar,he's got guilt written all over his face. He's paid out because he knows he'll be found out. Also his days as a working royal has been over for a long time. He's an embarrassment to the Royal family and lets be honest that takes some doing. The Queen and Prince Charles will shut out Andrew. Andrew is guilty in my opinion. Scandal has dogged the Royal family for years,in the days of King Henry 8th Andrews head and shoulders would be parting company. / ['Don’t forget Edward 7th not too long ago, hence the Edwardian era.

Epstein: Hey Andrew, if you find yourself in the US, come use my houses.  Prince Andrew: I wouldnt consider that being friends.  Interviewer: Epstein was arrested for procuring a minor, that was your friend?  Prince Andrew: Yep. / []
The first out of court settlement was an admission of guilt. The second out of court settlement was to remind him of his first admission of guilt an not be so arrogant in the future. / []

Wow! This dude would have folded on the stand like a house of cards. She must've gotten her weight of gold to shut this down. / []
It sounds like an interview reminiscent of The Medieval Inquisition, but what has Andrew ever done that's so bad? Millions of men have usually been with prostitutes for centuries and centuries. Prostitution is the oldest profession in the world. It is normal for men who are alone to go with prostitutes: however, it is necessary and indispensable to respect people and the dignity of people (women) and especially to behave, not that you just pay and you can do whatever you want. So everybody must treat prostutes with all respcet. After that  I believe that Prince Andrew has never hurt anyone and that he is basically a good person. Just a man, as many others in this world. / ['Bimbo, sex trafficking underage girls is not the same as consensual prostitution with an adult. Prince Andrew is not Hugh Grant, he was close friends with a human trafficker. Also, what are you talking about? This interview was entirely professional and polite. She’s not Torquemada.']
She's a rock star interviewer. / []
Hands up if you believe Andrew’s not guilty! 😂 / []
Lesson no 1 Do not lie. Lesson No 2 if you do, be smarter than this prick. / []
40:44 you move on by paying victim $10 million / []
Thanks for the 17 million ya beast / []
Look it's quite simple.....'I don't even remember what I don't remember alright'.  What else do you what from me? / []
I wonder - in an alternate timeline where Jimmy Saville was one of the royal family - whether he would have been allowed to use taxpayer money to pay out of court settlements to his accusers and avoid justice... / []
This scumbag has reached an out-of-court settlement with Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum of money / []
Somehow this makes less anxious thinking of the responsibility involved in parenting, because even if you are as great as Queen, it is still totally possible that you will bring up a total douchbag. / []

Who’s watching after he just paid her £12m ??? / []
Washing guilt with quid, can't wait till his bro is head of state. @18:35 / []
ive never seen a person so guilty / []
We really weren't good friends, more like casual friends but not really that close... BUT after he was convicted I had to go to the US and PERSONALLY tell him we weren't going to be friends any more. I am just too honorable so I must do it in person. How many times did he say "I am afraid to say I don't ____" Ummm no, if you never met her or if you never did anything untoward then you're NOT AFRAID to say it, you categorically say it never happened How weird and un settling was it that he laughed each time she said Epstein is dead? / []
People spend time around sexual abusers every single day. They don’t know what they are. The victim may believe that to be true. But doesn’t mean it is. That’s why abusers get away with it for so long. I think that’s a weak story. Did she regret what she had done? Why keep going back over and over again? Did she feel special sleeping with a prince? Many girls would. Especially young girls. Did she really not want to sleep with him? It’s all he said she said. Lots of older men go for young women. Being a British man used to British rules she was of the age of consent. Things were very different back then. / []
If this happened in the uk then she was of the age of consent. So no he wasn’t a ‘pedo’. Had she been raped as she claimed than obviously that’s terrible. But we have to remember here that women have come forward telling lies about people in the public eye before. And sometimes, just sometimes, these women were complicit in what was happening. They were often well compensated for their involvement. Why did they keep going back? Where were the parents? So many questions. I understand straightforward sex trafficking. Where women and girls are literally kidnapped from the street, or promised a new life in a new country. But this is murky. Very murky. They were American girls returned to their homes. They seem to have had families. And were paid for their time. We will likely never know the full truth. If some hadn’t lied before we would believe every person who comes forward as a victim. / []
He’s such a liar 🤥, and it’s funny and sad to watch at the same time, this creep needs to be in prison and get his salad tossed by a the biggest blackest mandingo in prison! / []
This man is one of the worst shit stains I've ever had the displeasure of laying my eyes on. And he's lying through his teeth while being very bad at it. / []
I too, had to sever my relationship with someone(Charles Manson) because he did some things that were.... well, unbecoming, frankly. / []
I often take a stroll in the New York City with the person I can no longer be seen with. As a former non-sweater, that's quite difficult. / []
I too, am a former non-sweater. / []
if he's paid money to keep out of prison then he's guilty / []
Im 14 minutes into this and the self inflicted body blows he's landing on himself are delicious. Wow, this is 49 minutes of comedy gold. / []
once again, being rich buys immunity, get out of jail free card is played / []
What an honorable man. Perfect example of a royal prince. The world owes this man an apology.

Just watched this ghastly performance by someone who is clearly lying.  Can't think of anything this pathetic. / []
Hmm an out of court settlement paid by someone who claims to be innocent… if you know your innocent you’d go to court, not pay the victim a large sum of money 🤔 if that doesn’t scream suspicious I don’t know what does / []
Back here straight after that out of court settlement / ['For a Christmas comedy interview special,  great idea!.']
Again bbc think there  judge and jury  First they need to think in with   Jim sav groom gangs . Lot of bbc  did do  From racist  and groom  gang there not interested  . / []
How does he know the photo was shot upstairs if he claims he has never been upstairs? 🤔 / []
And to think some morons of society worship the likes of royalty 🤣 / []
If he never went upstairs then how could the photo have been taken?  He is scrambling so much that logic has flown out of the window!!!  Prince Andrew is a PAEDOPHILE pervert and should go to prison!!!  It is more sickening that he patronized the NSPCC!!! / []
Out of court settlement, an interesting option to be taken by a man who claimed his innocence.. / []
Settled out of court / []
Yall were so worried about trashing Megan that you let an abuser get away for years. Typical racism / []
First, he is using his “role” and “duty” as a blanket to cover up his perverted and pedophile  behavior. SECOND, the arrogance he is displaying is of someone who is guilty. Third, we all know that nothing goes pass his mom. Those answers were reviewed by his mom and approved. Now she’s stripped his role and medals. She knows his son is a perverted sick disgusting man. / ['I just hope nothing untoward has happened with his daughters. The services should be contacted.', '@johndavidson7476 Eugenie was spotted this weekend with Harry at the Super Bowl.

“It was a shooting weekend”  Shooting what and in what sense?? 🤔 / ['Barely legal shooting by the sounds of things!']
I didn’t sweat at the time 🤣 / []
You’d have thought he’d have educated himself on the tell tale signs of lie, looking down and to the left, shaking his head when he is saying yes, the shuffling hands, overacting and pretending to think deeply, trying to build rapport with the interviewer, the list goes on. But he exhibits them all, and I’m only 3 minutes in! / []
Guilty as hell / []
He’s just too honorable ! Lol / []

Probably as solid an endorsement for the Pizza Express in Woking as I've ever heard. / []

Prince Andrew is full of sh*t / []
he's not a good liar. his tell is UM UM UM UMMMM / []
What, could not have been that night, so you ordered pizza with your daughter, that does not take all night, you had plenty of time to go clubbing after, those things usually start late. Worse alibi I ever heard, lying sack of shit. / []
Why does he stutter a lot? / []
one of the most powerful men in the world needs to hangout with a dude who likes kids because that guy has connections? what "connections" could you possibly not have access to being (formally) one of the highest ranking members of the royal family? / []
its a good sign that this monarchy will have same fate as Tsar, that's we should wait in near present. / []
Such a Royal 🍕💩 / []
Confusing / []
That's some 2nd grader level lying right there... / []
The hereditary principle; but for an accident of birth order, this witless, sweatless man, who holds you in obvious contempt, could have been your next monarch. Imagine, welcome to the three-decade long reign of the UK's first "King Andrew". Andrew too may have been conceived at "just a straightforward shooting weekend" as "one" often is. Perhaps Prince Philip had become contaminated with a bit too much lead shot on that fateful weekend of Andrew's conception way back in 1959? That does explain a lot... / []
All this PC culture is distorting, distorting and making us all woman. Everyone needs to take responsibility for what they do. Woman can't bang dudes and 10 years later when the man's rich go after him. This dude is full of shit but PC culture is bullshit as well 😒 / ['These were children. What are you talking about?', "@nikkik3263 Speaking in general. I don't  know what that sick cluck did."]
Apparently, the opportunities to learn about finances and banking were worth the eventual scrutiny he's facing for remaining friends with and staying with a child sex offender. He fully expected to never be held accountable for his association with Epstein. He says nothing about being disgusted at the extent of the trafficking network that Maxwell and Epstein operated, let alone the abuse the girls suffered. I hope he fries. / []
something tells me he is lying / []
Keep digging  and digging a. Big BIG HOLE / []
I never thought  he was such a thicko / []

People that blink very fast when being questioned are telling lies fact / []
Am sure the staff at the pizza place would of reconised if prince andrew if he bought pizzas in on the night in question and if so why have they not come forward toj back up his claim.answer is it never hapoened. / []
I watch this when I need a laugh  never have I seen a face and voice and head shaking blinking guilty man he gives it away so many times even the yes to her statements on Virginia he said yes yes yes and had a chuckle when “ she said it was memorable “ / []
Looks like the RF will have to pay several million pounds supplied by UK taxpayers to get Prince Andrew to leave Windsor quietly. So the Firm must of run out of Harry & Megan detractors.

OMG / []

He may “circle the bowl” all his life . The special forces won’t allow him to be prosecuted. / []
It’s the way he lets himself off for his behaviour and tries to justify it,  phrases like “I kick myself for” demonstrates how little responsibility he takes for his actions. Isn’t it funny how he thought Maxwell would be a safe allies lol / []
Andrew likes it up the arse / []
Bless him, such a naive and innocent soul off whose lips the truth dare not leap!   What a word salad, meant to throw everyone off the rotten scent of opulence and wealth, exploitation and the premise that money can buy anything and everyone!  Sweat not Andrew.  The Truth will out! / []
ANDREW IS ABSOLUTELY VERY STUBBORN WHAT EVER JEFFREY HAS ON HIM       it's hot 🔥 but seriously Andrew was young, and dum but he is a man with weaknesses so I don't blame Randy 🚽 / []
Amazing performance of the interviewer. This "prince" is shameful for the British Royal family. Should we consider this  guy as a common criminal, a dangerous pedophile or a criminal wiyh a sexual deviance behaviour? / []
He needs to be locked up wtf is this world man / []
I'm surprised he agreed to be interviewed. He dug his own low-graveness / []

Epstein gave him money and Epstein recorded everything for later blackmail purpose / []
That filler word ummm ummm ummm / []
He’s an absolute liar and knew everything from day one / []
This interview raises more questions than answers. My analysis of body language at 28:06 can be that he either has no recollection of the said events, or he does, but for some reason he will not reveal what really happened on that night. The stories of Epstein and Maxwell are disturbing to me for the amount of confusion that exists. / []

I would like to hear a yes or a no , Rather than a ,I don't recollect or a ,I don't remember "because He refuses to commit himself by dodging a direct answer..Guilty as charged ."Take him down" / []
He kept saying he wasn’t a very close friend, yet he stayed at his home for days and days!!! This is what Americans call being full of crap!! / []
He is such an ego maniac and so full of himself, he thought he could come out, control the interview, and come out smelling like a royal rose!!! Sorry. But it didn’t go that way / []
Okay, very inappropriate, particularly for a Monarchs son. However It must have been incredibly painful for Virginia Giuffre to participate in a Jetset lifestyle travelling in private jets between NY, American Virgin Islands and London; almost a torture.  And than almost 20 years later, after JE is gone and lots of his money, his estate, is waiting to be redistributed, all that pain re-emerges and can only be cured by a multimillion dollar lawsuit. / []
God, this guy loves the sound of his own voice 😒 / ['Dear god,that’s the sign of a good interviewer ffs !', "@shanet5604 Who said anything about the interviewer? Prince Andrew is and always was a pompous, arrogant prick - that's the point."]
He remembers Clearly going to the pizza express because he says thats an "Unusual thing" for him to do, However,does not remember meeting Virginia Roberts at all.Guess thats because thats what he does Usually huh. / []
he even laugh that she remembers well the encounters 28:02 / []
He's under pressure, antibuuse / []
The worst decision he ever made is doing this interview, that just shows how horrible this mans judgement is, did he really think that this was going to go well? He might as well have had a young Russian girl massaging his feet during the interview / []
I believe, yes the rich and  powerful is not above the law, but others shouldn't be able to tare the rich down, because of envy. I believe Prince Andrew is in the dark of any action from Jeffrey and his friends. Andrew has  kept in a different environment, from sex affener ways of lifestyle. Young girls must do better. The law must change directions and  it's justice so that respect is kept inside out of individual lifestyle of men and woman. In todays world She don't want money but at that  time money was ever thing to her. So what change for her now. What the hated now. That she targets Andrew. Its crazy I believe wisdom and intelligence will play out in favour of Andrew. Because I  can freely say human are care free in hurting others and themselves. Its plan and organise why? Exactly. Good will over come evil. I will seek good to help. In any case. Time will tell / ['poor liar']

He’s apparently a liar and thinks we are as stupid & immoral as he is. Supposedly, the Queen had more time to be a mother to Andrew. That fact is not a positive testimony to her parenting skills. I have two adult sons & would be horrified to have raised such a pompous pig. / []

It apears that Virginia was paid, it's not the same as being trafficked. It also seems that she had many clients, why did she chose Prince Andrew? Why is she wearing summer clothes on the photo in January? Something fishy is going on and Maitlis missed it. / []

Prince Andrew is an untouchable living above the law. Epstein wasn't living above the law.

These untouchables belong to the warmongering imperial families that own the central banks. / ['It’s both. Epstein was living above the law until he became a liability to the rest of his wealthy predator ‘friends.’']
This cretin thinks we would believe anything that he spouted. He might as well said that it couldn't possiblly be him in that photo as he  has a medical peculiarity which means he was born without a head, and his mother as monarch couldn't possibly be seen or let alone imagined as bent over or spread eagle pushing out somthing so fundamentally ginormous as that  anyway / []

They do this for money, to overtake, to infiltrate, to occupy the entire lives of families they seek to alienate and make family members afraid or ashamed to associate with their own family so they can isolate us and terrorize the life out of you alone, and essentially misuse power and tortures together to torture people to death and steal our family wealth. Here the gov followers call trump as minister in scientology sadist cult, JESUS. The imbalance of trump the idiot thinking he is JESUS shows the US depravity for greed over every living and past living leader or powers of the World. It's bragged that trump went after Kim Jung Un and his wife on his presidential visit with Sentient Knowledge mind reading elon musk spacex technology that I personally named WITH (WIFI in the head). They have bragged about force thinking western culture habits onto Mr. Un's Wife. THOSE PICTURES ARE 30 YEARS AGO, these lies are built for money, for invading families in US FOR DECADES  and other nations to destroy family. Here in US they use WITH (WIFI in the head) military equipment technology for implanting thought that is actual low minded criminally insane poolice, fbi, even prison guards and military to speak into a network system of domestic espionage against family & force speak crazy as what they think which is tawdry and uncommon nastiness to everyone. If its on The Queen Of England she would receive unnatural thought process of start to think of Phillip by normal thought, but the espionage military sentient knowledge WITH program sends many peoples voices that will say over and over a negative command against Prince Phillip. We don't think in repeat fast fire orders of actions we tell ourselves to do. These used and turned very evil US gov employees are mentally unstable neurotic lunatics who are also psychologically neurotic in speech to overthink our own thoughts on insistent repeat fire thought that is maladjusted to say the least. If The Queen Of England thought there was a need to strip Monarchy Powers from her family, she would think it once or think maybe its required, but she would not think it 5 times in a row as a command to her by US interference in The Queen's Business and The Queen's Family. This explanation is offered as a WARNING to foreign sovereigns to know if you are being modern day militarily overtook by US TECHNOLOGICAL ESPIONAGE INVASION. I am a US Whistleblower on the fraud, espionage, and technology criminal products, including 5G for physical pain torture, by the US being used for World Destruction of Peace and Harmony among Nations and Family. The rich in US are so impoverished in morals or merit, and their greed of ownership and power over others is so far advanced for decades by Antichrist Obama Terrorist Act rules for American Terrorism of old dead scroll style Muslim dictates for deprivation and human punishment that is also tied to the rich and famous funded scientology sadist cult with fbi dictates, so none are safe, even US CITIZENS, from US TERRORISM as the cruelest and most genocidal terrorism on Earth ever before. I and my entire family are decades long victims of these evils. My Father Robert S. TYLER the 1st, Wrote for the BBC DECADES BACK, and my name D'Evelyn came from one of his stories he submitted to BBC for consideration. I worry that Prince Phillip has some of the US tortures on him as those eyebags are typically injected fluids they put on many here in the US by force and gov ghb misuse to destroy good looks and personal confidence of good health and insert the microwave wire for 5G 364ghz currents microwave pain and shock tortures to eyes and face. I know this interview played while I typed, but the sound was off. It is very torturous to me to watch US getting away with these evils as they put our own Brother into prison innocent 25years ago saying for a murder cutting up his fiance with no body, no real dna, using a piece of steak as a knee, and santa clara county coroner said no proof of death until 9 years later missing that long, but poolice gov madeup this evil scenario of ritual murder of their own vile contemptible thoughts of evil and convicted a good innocent man with no proof and false evidence in crooked US Court System for money payoffs and property overtakes thefts. The missing fiance, Imelda Pascua - Phillipine descent, never looked for has been said to have also been put into prison to hide her still being alive. Do Not Submit your Country's Authority to Evil American Rich Foes To Humanity. As I seek to write books of 40years in this evil plots for US controlling ownerhip over innocent lives by presidential misuse of antichrist obama terrorist act rules for human and animal destructions takeover GOV BETRAYERS and WITH BIDEN and BIDEN - THE DIRTY DEAL books are halted intervened by hacking and theft of my $5000 Quosmio laptop by gov, and now my hacked new HP $900 laptop by them rewritten my BIOS in front of my eyes with no internet in the house, but plugged into the electrical outlet AND changing my illegally gates forced WINDOWS PIN to even access my ownership. This is evil US TECHNOLOGY HARMS OF TOTAL CONTROL TO US CITIZENS. THEY HAVE LOCKED ME OUT OF USE OF MY OWN EQUIPMENT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT UPLOADING OF TAX DOCS, FOR PERSONAL ONLINE BANKING, FOR TYPING ANYTHING AT ALL, OR FOR WATCHING NEWS, ETC. The US Gov ruin of all electrical power plugins in US as dedicated permanent WIFI NETWORKS for hacking any device 24/7 listening and talking availability and sale of access by darkweb of any family, any home, any business to anyone interested in paying the gov for access, is the invasion of private life by mental illness in US GOVERNMENT. They woke me up with these technology misuse this a.m. around 4:00 and spewed more tawdry evils that trump is a pedophile rapist who wants the kids he rapes murdered after sexual violation. This is to tell you the damaged level of US thinking on gov statements of US evil to accuse any of these deviant sexual crimes, even England Princes, and trump leads this phishingscam mess in US that some could be fighting to get discontinued. I KNOW I AM. They wanted to know who is going to stop trump, I've been trying for over a year. This is a whitehouse darkweb run phishingscam for my high equity California home, my cars, my kids lives and freedoms, my books rights,  my soon to be available this year social security they overtake in droves of lives US gov and poolice see as useless and used by them for illicit fraudulent payments by federal systems that hardworking Americans pay into for decades as our retirement they steal by greed for ownership of lives and earnings not their own. / []
Absolutely no self insight.   My jaw just drops further every couple of minutes. My first time seeing this. She handed him the shovel and he just kept digging.  I can imagine Andy"s staff expressions at this horror show. And I feel sorry for British people watching too. / []
Virginia Guffries claims that she was a minor…….where were her parents when this underaged girl went partitng and jetsetting all over the three continents?She travelled all over the globe without her parents knowledge…..its not like you were taking a tripto another county?She is a gold digger and a money grabber who slept with anybody who has money.She was paid a monetery settlemennt of around 500,000 dollars from Epstein in 2009.She needs more money now and I think she must have taught Prince Andrew many things in bed at the age of seventeen……..she must have slept with dozens of men before that but none must have been rich and powerful as Prince Andrew!She does not know what she is dealing with……the rich and influencial always have secret backup plan!This is why they have been so sucessful foe centuries! / ['That’s right blame the victims, it’s always their fault. No coercion from Maxwell I’m sure. Epstein was a complete gentleman with honourable intentions, like eh…. Andrew.']

Epstein never told anyone he was trafficking young girls-instead he hired these girls and told people they were his travelling masseuses or personal assistants some stayed for as long as 4 years. He took them into his dungeon and mostly he would walk in for sessions they all have said on tv interviews. None have said other men were on the massage table.  Will be interesting to hear how  Andrew "became a trafficker-bought trafficked girls and slept with them from Epstein" does- it all seems a little far fetched that prince joined forces with Epstein as all the royals from birth have a stream of women throwing them selves at them.  Virginia took his private jet to places to "meet other men" why leave your boyfriend to do that-so sad.  None of this would have happened if the creep was poor! / []
I heard that Virginia Roberts was a keen dancer herself, apparently, she used to do Ballet with her right leg and Irish dancing with the left,.. and made a living in between 😂 / []
I stopped at 30 min not thinking it can get any worse. N then I went back to finish it. He literally chocked on his own spit answering her questions who let him do this interview??? This is so reckless. 😭 / ['Apperntly he was advised and warned against doing it, did it anyway, digged himself in, and thought the interview had gone rather well afterward. \nIf he he end up being questioned by a judge and/or hostile laywer(s) things will be interesting in a scadenfraude kind of way.']

He is too defensive. The worst liar why didn’t anyone help him lol / []
we can not jump to conclusions just because someone is accusing him of something. Noone of us was there, and this is really bad how we are so ready to hang someone without having proper evidence.   Just because he knew that other guy that does not mean he did something.  Then if we are going to be hanging every single male Epstein knew and spent time with, then we need to start with some of the ex-presidents.  Because there are photos of them too.

My biggest worry isn't who's guilty who did what to whom so what some stupid girls got taken advantage of because the perpetrators didn't think they could get caught. The perpetrators of the the past were stupid the perpetrators of today are learning by watching this unfold. The women this happened to went on to have lives the victims of the future may not be so lucky. / []

He is a TERRIBLE liar. It is almost comical to watch, and deliciously entertaining. She did an incredible job. Wow / ['Yes his face became red 😅', '😅😂']
Now Lady? Victoria Hervey claims the photo was from a Irish double. Some survivor of Epstein has said. Does she not realise she’ll have to make a sworn deposition in court over this.

give this man a lie detector test man we will put a end to all this / []
#freeandrew #justiceforepstein / []
I think the appeal of Epstein & staying at his New York apartment was the access to young girls for him to abuse. No doubt if he pays Virginia out or in court it’ll be my money, as a tax payer, that is used for the settlement, it makes me sick knowing that this criminal is gonna get away with his sordid sick crimes. He is a damn liar, he may be honourable to sexual predators but he wasn’t honourable to the girls he abused / ['It won’t be taxpayers money he’s appearing in court as a private citizen he’ll pay it himself', '@itsme1585 What a load of Codswallop, mummy will pay, we pay mummy.

We are thankfully living in a time when the rich and powerful and yes, even royalty, are being held accountable. Mostly this is due to our speedy access to information.

How do you Brits continue to worship these "royals"? They are not better than the common man. This tradition should be abolished forthwith. There's too much time and money wasted on these people.

She is impressive - never seemed to ‘be unpleasantly aggressive’.

Is it an interview or a FBI criminal investigation? The journalist has to act as what she is. The queen should be sad to have all her children behaving so lightly. They had best nannies but nothing like a wise maternal education! Too late  now / []
This news channel is biased....just as all main stream media! I live in the US...you guys are Anti Monarchy! Boring! / ["He's been proven guilty, its not our fault the monarchy is so evil"]
why didn’t they fix his tie 🤦🏽‍♀️ / ['Lol, I noticed that too 😆😩']
Accountable for what exactly??  The 2 people who "trafficked" this woman have paid.  Did she refuse to sleep with him?? Did he rape her? What's the accusation? She was of age and prostitutes abound - if he did even sleep with her?  Was he supposed to investigate if she'd been trafficked.  I don't know what the actual crime is / ['Google what he did, there is proof and one of the girls was underaged as well']
Breh he said she had already left to go to the island when he was still in New York lol / []
BBC is as bad as CNN / []
I believe him / ['😭😭😭npc found', 'Pick me! Pick me!']
Anybody here believe Prince Andrew? Anybody? Anybody anywhere out there? Again, anyone? / ['No']
I am going to prison because it was a convenient place to stay and I wouldn’t have met these people without going to prison / []
If I’m stammering I’m lying / []
I loved when he starting talking up his accomplishments towards the end. This guy really loves himself! He so darn guilty. 😂 / ['He comes off as a narcissist', '@charlotte_stevens oh without a doubt!!', 'Every narcissist loves talking about themselves']
This will be held as the ultimate car crash interview for all eternity... Unbelievable... / []
Wow 😣 this guy is a tool and narcissist🤡. When he says"there was no indication by him or anyone" of what Epstein was up to?! I'M SURE THE VICTIMS KNEW 🤦🖕. He's so  self righteous saying things like "if anything I'm too honorable". 😂😕🤪... OMG this just gets worse and worse for him?? Now he wasn't able to sweat 💦😂 what a convenient way to remind ppl he was a ,"hero" to the English🙄... He's in no way prepared for this interview 🙈. But you can just hear him say  I'll just wing it 😂 because all his life people have just gushed over him 🤢. / []
RANDY ANDY is in big trouble. / []
“That photo was taken upstairs, and I don’t think I ever went upstairs.”  lol / ['Right ? Omg I can’t believe he said that. It’s like how do you know the picture was taken upstairs??? How do you know what the upstairs looks like', '😂😂😂', "Didn't he say he stayed there?", '🤣🤣🤣 i think he actually believes his own lies !!!!!']
I have a medical condition which means that I don't sweat.... Well at least up until now! / []
Yeah when you get a rape allegation thrown at you a normal reaction to that is 'well that is a bit strange I dont remember this' as if it's totally possible, but you just don't happen to remember you raping this person in particular. / []
He’s so sus / []
“We weren’t that close”. But it took a personal visit to him in another country to break up with him? Then stayed four days. What a crock. / ["It's just his tendency to be to honorable.....but that's just the way it is...ya see...\n\n....tell ya what....boy be sweatin' now!", 'This https://youtu.be/Rq3Zb3AghBE❤️\u200d🔥', 'He could’ve made a phone call…', 'he should be in prison for sure but so should the girl who carried on for 2 years procuring other young girls into prostitution.....but instead of prison she gets not 1 but 2 lottery wins', 'there is 1 girl who claims to be a "victim" of epstein who traveled 38 times to his private island to have sex with epsteins client and got paid very generously ....at what point in those 38 visits did she start becoming a victim??....']
Oh Boy! / []
"last time we were pictured together is exactly when i broke off the friendship" ..... BRO / []
"I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken." / []
He is so full of shit...waffling bollocks all the way through this interview / []
Yea yea yea lies / []
Stop  accusing Prince  Andrew!!! I analized the situation proper!!! The woman who is trying to accused Prince Andrew... She knew what she was doing!! Was up to her to refused  to have any verbal contact with Prince Andrew. Why she didn't? She was free to leave!!!! I am a mother off two and I was married I was 17 years old. Certainly I knew what I was doing!!!     Is time to stop accusing  Man is a sexual abuser!!  Sexual abuses is when the woman is forced to have  phisical intimacy with a man or woman.  But if was no violence or the woman was not phisical forced to have any phisical contact.. this is not considered a sexual abuse or sexual violence "" not at all"" many public figures images was damaged because off  woman games!!!  Where are the prove that this low profile woman  was abused?? In my opinion. This woman have plans and target.. 17 years old woman .. they are not inocente ! They know exactly what they are doing!! Leave Prince Andrew alone and Ex President Clinton and many other people .. you have to blame the woman not the man!! My name is Janette Maria van Doornik and this is my point of view!!  Don't copy my stetament with out my authorization!! Today is 30/01/2022 Best Regards / ['victim blaming janette is at it again 🤡']
What if Jeffrey and ghislaine were attempting to blackmail him, hence why they were there waiting with a camera 📷 when he went to break up the friendship etc etc / ['I can see why you’re called the Unsuccessful Genius.

This guy is the epitome of a liar!! Its a pity nothing will ever come of this because of who he is. / []
I think a mountain is being made out of a molehill to a certain extent personally, and I'm not protesting that he is  totally innocent, but things like foot 👣 massages I'm like "so what" and that's just one example of many things I could point to!. / []
The truth always finds it’s way out. / []
Haven’t you read the news that Andrews best friend who nows is in prison, will name drop EVERYBODY lol / []
To watch this interview is like testing your patience! seriously, has he ever answered a question in his entire life? Does anybody advise him on anything like at all? Hats off for the interviewer, if I were her, I would have suffered so much throughout this interview. It's not about the truth or lies; the guy can't make up his mind! he keeps contradicting himself like crazy!! / ['Yes they advised him to NOT do this interview , something he refused to listening to. And probably will regret that he didn’t listening for the rest of his life.']
He took a convicted sexual offender to his daughter's 18th birthday? 🤦‍♀️ / ["And Andy's reply. Epstein only came as Maxwell's plus one. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄", 'THIS! Father of the Year! 🤢🤢🤢', '@87Strong well, he has definitely hurt those girls. Both just gave birth. Eugenie was working on 2 important issues, slave labor and scoliosis funding, and is STILL close to Meghan. She allegedly dreamed of having a podcast and going on shows to spread awareness. Now nobody will touch that family.']
I am addicted to this interview / []
Ok, let's say the bloke had sex with a teenager. So what!  Leave him alone. / ['He didn’t “had sex”, he abused her', "Somebody should check out Steffi's search history and ask his daughter if she's okay"]
One denial after the other; I don't believe him. / []
Why hasn't this young woman named others? Prince Andrew is the Golden Goose with the Golden Egg. She can't name Clinton as she'd be afraid of the Clinton Legacy which may have reached Mr Epstein. Stay in the UK, please. She's not an innocent child and wasn't when she was with Mr Epstein, allegedly of course! Why was she with him so long? who else did she meet? The basic questions will not come out in court because the WOKE PEOPLE will scream and yell. She will be defended regardless. She's not a victim. Don't come to USA as you will never win here. / ["When was ANY woman afraid of Clinton? Didn't you notice a pattern with Clinton? It's always portly mature women...all his accusers, which he eventually had to admit to having sex with, were not the skinny teenage type that ANYONE would pay for. So maybe that is why she's not naming him."]
As soon as Prince Andrew stated that it was a "convenient" place to stay( at Epstein's house) that showed me he's as guilty as sin. With all his means ( money, status)  the last place he should have stayed was at Epstein's house. He's guilty by association if nothing else. But I'm sure he's guilty of more than just association. / []
it is documented, in many cases, that Youths and persons who are groomed and trafficked, sometimes tend to display behaviours and countenance which seem to be in agreement with the exchanges and contractions etcetera taking place. / []
My two questions about the picture is why  does it appear she has her hand around him and how comes she looks so happy? / ['Well, would she cry? Just because she looks happy doesn’t means she is happy.', 'I think most 17.5 year olds would be fairly at happy at a free holiday to Europe, and then if you get a photo with some famous guy there could be potential for a life changing payout', "You act like people can't fake a smile? People smile when they are unhappy all the time that proves nothing", '@pink-uv3th The smile and the body language look genuine - can it be faked - well sure. But if you can fake being happy for a photo, who says you can\'t fake being happy for a Prince. Is someone supposed to just assume everyone has been "trafficked".', 'I will be glad when this trial is  over and  the truth comes out whatever it is. It gets sickening.']
Jeffrey Epstein got publicly talked about by the mainstream media and it’s for reasons like that journalism is mostly dead.  The elite can’t have their pimp being in the public eye.  This is stupid.  Epstein supposedly hired thousands of hookers.  He probably started off by pimping out his students from his high school teacher job.  When someone starts I read s their average age is 13.  It’s creepshow stuff.    Tho guys thinking their bug studs.  Epstein probably got all his money being a pimple to the ruling class.  Didn’t you notice the other 3000 girls didn’t speak up because if they tried the police would probably kill them.    Hmm.  There’s probably 30 more guys like him / ['Reputations of powerful men can’t be tossed in the bin by some journalists.  So the mediator here is state run propaganda..']

Watching this after the fact is hilarious  He’s trying to play down their relationship while also simultaneously claiming he should get immunity.  And we were only acquainted through. Maxwell but I couldn’t just call and end the friendship. 🤔 / []
A used car salesman is more believable. Rich and famous as he was you couldn’t just pay for a hotel?? / []
Andrew you need to have someone at this interview trip over a cord so that the screen goes black and they have technical difficulties to stop this train wreck.  He can’t sweat, Andrew,  I bet you are sweating now! 😂😂😂😂 / []
"This photograph of me is fake because I do not remember it being taken".   Would this even work anywhere? / []
Hahaha what a liar / []
He doesn't regret a friendship with a sex offender.? / []
Definitely guilty. / []
I believe him.. / ['Trying to crucify a guy who used poor judgment..and yet..felt loyalty to someone he met thru a third person is understandable!', 'Are you joking 🤣😭 clearly guilty.', "@raihamarsden08 your a bad judge of character clearly.

He didn't spend 4 days breaking up a relationship with a known pedophile. He was there parting it up with Jeffrey abusing children. This interview makes me SICK. / []
What a liar omfg you can tell he s lying 💯 percent / []
Eggstein really educated him on “International Trade” . / ['Eggstein:)']

She kept it as classy as possible. Good job. / []
31:53 sounds like a confession to me. What was going through his mind when he said this? 🤔 / ['Bragging and being macho. He is slimy', 'My God.. I missed this']
He knows the exact date when he took his kid fro ice cream? That sealed it for me. I can’t remember an exact date that I took my kid to Disneyland a few months ago. / ['Exactly what I was thinking 👍', 'Try to remember every step when the media try to convicte u with sex offending!!!', 'I can’t even remember the exact date last week when I took my son for icecream']

What a liar ! / []
People claim rape all time took her this long nt a real photo seems dodgy to me the truth will come out / ["Yeah, except this time, several people who are in jail admitted to trafficking this and other girls and grooming them. The FBI investigated. Why do you think the Queen took his titles? Because the secret services and she don't have a clue about what happened?  Use your mind."]
@13:45  Emily: ‘John Brockman literary agent was there…’  Andrew: Cranes neck in surprise ‘Really?’ A few seconds later ‘I don’t know him’  😂  Andrew totally underestimated Emily, thinking he would be treated with kid gloves… then she encircled him in a ring of 🔥 Every fibre in his being was then recruited to saving his own skin, but the fool simply drowned in his own poo poo. / ["Hes like Trump.

If you want to break up a friendship with someone you why would you fly to another country and spend 4 days at their home? Why not just pick up the phone? You expect us to believe that?

How'd he know what the upstairs look like / ["He knew because he only ever went downstairs. A man who can't sweat can't possibly climb stairs."]
LOL not super good friends but yes, I had a break up with him but yes I had dinner with him and sigh, it was convenient to stay with him.  I was doing a number of things and I've gone through it in my mind, many times.  I have never partied. / []

He cannot say if she's lying because he doesn't know what she's trying to achieve?!? / []
So pompous  he referred  to  his mother  as the queen  such an arrogant  insignificant toad  full of his own importantance. / []

must have terrible lawyers or hes admitted it to them ....... / []
Better than the best of comedies. They both are phenomenal, in very different ways, though. I have no recolection of watching anything that twisted :) / []
Truly astonished by this interview again! ...It's just a regular shooting party...Someone like me does not go to Pizza Express much and I remember it..Don't regret meeting Mr Epstein because I got what I wanted out of it for a job that I was unqualified for... / []
People keep saying she’s underage but 17 is not underage according to uk law. If Andrew wasn’t aware of the coercion how is it an offence ? / ['17 is underage in America and that is where the first assault occurred. And Prince Andrew knew damn well because, as Ghisilaine Maxwell stated (and why she is in jail) is that the job was to sell underage women to rich older men for sex. A man like Andrew has lawyers and advisors which he clearly ignored and got off on the "underage" thing. He paid for it.', '@corinapopescu8791 In New York the age of consent is 17. It differs per state. Whether he was aware of her age is another question, whether they even had sex, and whether he was aware she was a prostitute or paid her is yet another question.', '@onezerooneseven there is no age of consent to assault.', '@corinapopescu8791 And no one is saying you can. He denies any sex took place, I was simply noting that the age of consent in NY is 17. How likely it was he knew she was claiming to be "trafficked" is another question.', '@onezerooneseven well as for him knowing she was being trafficked is simple. She was provided by Maxwell and Epstein, both of who admitted to making a fortune from selling underage girls to rich guys who got off on that sort of thing. Look, he was a prince, a war hero, handsome and educated...he had access to some of the most beautiful women on earth. Why go to Epstein, the child trafficker?']

“If the legal advice were to (testify), then I would be duty bound to do so”.  Well the learned judge has found that the evidence rises above the bar of ‘upon legal advice’  to ‘required by law’.  As not just a ‘Royal Highness’ but an ‘honourable’ one to boot. I’m sure we can all agree what he’s ‘duty bound’ to do next? ‘Likely to do next is’ a horse of a different colour. Im sure the other royals are hoping that a ‘straightforward shooting weekend’ might settle the matter? / []
Where's the sympathy for the victims? Pervert Prince? / ['In his mind it is blatantly obvious that only rich people are "human". The "unwashed masses" aren\'t even in his memory.', "@corinapopescu8791 He's guilty, Epstein's employee confirmed his sick relationship with Virginia.  He's said that he barely knew Epstein.  So why travel to New York to break off friendship with Epstein?  Suspect!", "@LambsyLamb I've no doubt he will downplay some aspects, and even e completely truthful, but I wouldn't assume that means he had sex with her, or of he did he knew her age or believed she had been trafficked. I don't think a truly guilty person would have ever given that interview or at least come up with some better answers. There is no such thing as a perfect victim or a perfect defendant."]
REALLY andrew let his daughters be friends with a paedophile speaks volumes / []
I honestly can't remember meeting her  The picture you see here of me is a cardboard cut out of me the house is made of lego and the person who took the photo borrowed my arm because that's not my arm around her / []
Interviewer - Are you saying she's lying?   Prince Andrew - That's a very difficult question to answer.  lol what? / ['Yeah especially after denying ever meeting her at all. 🤦\u200d♀️']
Here's the punishment .You throw this pedophile in a room with a wolverine who's high on angel dust. Nuff said. / []
Emily is applying pressure!!!! So gracefully! / []
I saw Virginia Roberts interview that woman was not lying and had a picture. / []
He lying clearly and why does he appear so nervous!!!!! / []
The craziest thing is that with the recent Vanity Fair article and recount of the interview, Andrew actually thought he did a fantastic job!! / []
He's a big FAT lair, or has he alzemiers or he's the invisible man lol 😆 🤬 / []
This is masterclass in interrogation. Emily was so good at this. He really did think he was going to intimidate with the pomp and circumstance of where he chose to stage this interview. Several times during the interview she repeats the last few words of his answers. She let's him talk, and talk he does! Repeatedly padding the conversation with extraneous and unnecessary intricate details. Highlighting both his own sense of self importance and his desire to control the narrative. Fail!   I really do wish she had asked him ( since he highlighted is head patronage of the NSPCC) how wise it was for him to go and stay with a convicted child predator, considering his obvious deep involvement in the protection of children? / ['True. She allowed Andy to speak and dig his own grave.', 'https://youtu.be/uTmwFY2Tndw\nIt’s runs in the circles people feed people to the royals and the elite', 'Exactly what I thought when he said that!', 'I noticed him say that too! Makes me so suspicious, him learning specific signs that a child is vulnerable, neglected, etc would make it so easy for him to prey on these children and or facilitate their being trafficked or abused. Also creepy that he would be involved in teaching signs of abuse as well as next steps, it leaves so many kids vulnerable just having someone like this, with so much power, in an org like this', "You know why people like this become involved in children's charities/issues.........no.......well I will tell you.  It is because they get the inside information about complaints about high profile people and can give them the heads up.  That is what I heard and I believe it."]
10 minutes into the video and honestly this guy just needs to stfu and just say I’m a pedophile and I need help. Stop dragging your lie along in 40+ min segment, get help and tell the public you are. We’d be more pleased to hear that than this whole facade. / []
Brilliant 👏 😂 / []
Obviously doing his best to cover his tracks. FAIL, lol / []
Virginia D is a brave young woman for standing up to a powerful moron. I pray she wins. / []
It's asinine that he says they were not particularly close at the very beginning of the interview...but Andrew feels so obligated to fly all the way to New York to tell Epstein in person that he can't be friends with him because it's the honorable thing to do...what a contradiction‼️.    Andrew is lying during the entire interview. Andrew is simply a pretentious, unintelligent liar Who just happens to be the queen of England's favorite son...there is nothing to admire about him.  He knows the truth. Virginia knows the truth.  Let's pray the facts come out and bring some truth to this man who enjoyed a friendship with his pedophile friend. / []
So you can’t remember meeting a woman who you had sex with 3 times in early 2000’s but you can remember going to a pizza express in the 80’s 😂 seems abit dodgy to me mate 🤷‍♂️ / ["But that's because that pizza was spicy and it was the last time he sweated. He didn't show it though...too royal to show emotions you see."]
That went well for him. It appears that the now de-royaled buffon seek  to take the allegories against him to court rather than settle the matter. Presumly that mean being questioned in person there by more hardcore and less polite interviewers than this one. Should be interesting in a scadenfraude kind of way. / []
Damn...my english is not perfect Don' t understand everything they'r saying But in 🇮🇹 is impossibile to find it Just some pieces of it / []
Ok. If you are honorable: please dont go to a sexual offender’s house, of minors for God’s sake, right HRH? / []
The one thing that everyone misses is the fact that not one single person has come out to try and confirm one single lie he tells. Pizza Express: staff/customers/his daughter’s friends’ parents!? Don’t sweat; medical evidence/doctor? Where are the people to back him up? Cue tumbleweed… / ['I agree with you.  On the other hand I am slightly puzzled that there are no pictures of them at Tramp or very few witnesses who have said they remember seeing them together in Tramp']
One of the shining stars of Little Britain. / []
Lies lies lies and more lies on top of lies / []
26:55 Sorry to be pedantic, he said the photo of him and the girl was taken upstairs and then he said he'd never been upstairs. So how would he even know what upstairs looked like? / ["He went upstairs only after he had regained his ability to sweat. Didn't you hear the man? Too much of a war hero to sweat and too royal to show emotion", "You can see the banister in the picture, that typically indicates that it is upstairs. At least for British houses. And of course if you know what the downstairs looks like then that makes it more obvious. But yes a strange thing to emphasize in the circumstances. If I was guilty I wouldn't be putting attention in that direction, which is part of the reason why I don't think he is guilty.", "@onezerooneseven if he isn't guilty why would she go after him? Why did he offer to settle and pay her? Usually people don't hallucinate about things like this. Why doesn't she just take the money and run?", "@corinapopescu8791 Good questions, I think there are some fairly obvious answers regarding motivation. It's impossible to know who is being truthful, both have big motives not to be so. People will do a lot for a possible million dollars, that's human nature.", '@onezerooneseven yes but she already got 7 million pounds. Andrew and the family have offered to settle time and again and she has refused without a public admission of guilt and an apology. That in itself tells me, and obviously it told the Queen, a whole lot.']

1st he said he wasn't aware of any investigations in 2000, then he knew about it in 2006 and cut it off "until" 2010 because of the accusations....just to visit him in 2010 to suddenly tell him in person "we can't be seen together"???? But then he was there in 2010 for dinner, which wasn't just dinner, but a few days stay?? "It was convenient for him", as if it were soooo hard for a prince to find a place to stay. 😂 Uhmm, yeah right.  THEN he says that he wasn't aware of the allegations in 2006 as she asked him why he invited him to his daughter's party. BUT THEN goes on to say he ceased contact in 2006. Boy o boy, get your story together. Court will be going longer then this interview.   Oh, I didn't sweat back then. But thru many things I've done, I now sweat, but couldn't back then due to a medical condition. 🤣👌🏼 Yeah, I bet.  We didn't see eachother often, maybe 2-3 x a year. That's quite alot for 2 people who have an ocean between them...then thinking about him staying at his houses while he wasn't there.  At the end he says he's only been there 4 times in TOTAL in all those years. 😂🤦🏻‍♀️  "So Mr B... statement is false?"  "I don't know Br..."  Well, that isn't what she asked.   He doesn't "remember" dancing, drinking and having sex with her? How often has he done that, that he can't remember? And he says he doesn't even recall ever being in that bar, but then says he doesn't drink and doesn't recall ever buying a drink "whenever I was there" 😂   Ghislaine is getting a break down knowing he's going to court. She probably thought she stood a chance with having a prince on her side. / ['No she will probably name her nine John Does as a plea bargain to reduce her sentence. Andrew is pathetic']

Once the out of court settlement has been finalised (The jury won’t find any sympathy for him, frequenting houses of ill repute and underage )  He can go to the Duchy estate and help plant new trees, because boy! he can dig a good deep hole. / []
He's been probably been trained after this interview 24/7 to not go down in court and drag the families name thru dirt. No way in hell they're just letting him walk in there "untrained". / []

THE PHOTOGRAPH OF THEM TOGETHER  The authosenticity of picles colour shade light dentcity ectect .....why has this not been rsearched The picture quality is sufficiently clear and graphic...if he had been photographed holding hands with a *BIG FOOT the whole world would be Convinced of the reality. HRH memoury of Any event is totaly immaterial to the even remote possibility of such a thing happenning *Saquash / ['Remember the FredWEST& family case / apparently His fathers perverted advice was Yeh son.....do what ever you can get away with..........hmmm']

He says Epstein had an amazing way of bringing all sorts of people together, that was because he was blackmailing them all. I do wish someone would come out and accuse Clinton, because he really is a big POS / []

“You probably dragged out of me all that is required” he says with a smirk. That and the “I’m too honorable” comment” are just astonishingly stupid.

13.44 is the most damning give away in this entire piece. He is shocked at that moment, the few seconds that follow he completely gives himself away, his tells are obvious, the eyes, the voice, the rolling, the curt speech the, lack of candidness, - "did that happen"? - "No". So VG is lying and JB is lying and he is the only one who isn`t lying...I hear he wants to go before a jury and hope he does, it will be hilarious but will never happen of course; his lawyers will not let him anywhere near a witness box. He will offer a settlement and she - VG - will take it. And he will fade away as a pariah, a laughing stock / ['https://youtu.be/uTmwFY2Tndw\nAt the comments from this video where the queen scares a little boy it seems like a lot of people are really waking up to what these evil people are really about', "JOHN BROCKMAN Drilled him to the core! Andrew wasn't the same after that!"]
Just because he’s a member of the royal family doesn’t mean he’s invincible. In his interview he made such a massive idiot of himself.  He’s so cocky and arrogant. If he’s guilty then he should  be put in prison for these sex crimes like any other normal human being. But that’ll never ever happen because of the family he’s born into. Disgusting 🤮 man. My thoughts go out to the Queen with Andrew being her favourite son she must be disappointed… / []
Eeww / []
What’s missing from this interview?   Maybe something like ::::  In the times I travelled to and or stayed with Epstein, I didn’t have sex with anyone in any of his properties ever      or   I have daughters the same age as the victim and find it appalling and disgusting that I am accused of doing something like this which I never have or would have done. ::::   That.  That’s what missing - oh that and ::::  I am sickened at the thought of what the victims of Epstein have been through :::::        He showed very little if any empathy for the victims.       Fool. / []

This is my 3rd time watching this interview. In the light of recent events, I had to come back and watch it again. "I was just a good friend of Ghislaine, and Jeffrey was her plus-one." And now Ghislaine is in prison too. It's not just a car-crash interview. It's a horror movie. I'm laughing out loud but puking too. It's just ... ??!! / ['Hey hope you did not forget about Lord Savile and his connection to the royal family. Then go look into the westminster paedophile dossier... then all the grooming gangs and ask yourself why there has never been a london grooming gang arrested. It goes all the way...', '@fatjohn1408 OMG - do you mean Sir Jimmy Savile? You are correct. He was another monster, protected by the establishment. These 2 cases are not connected directly, but you are right to draw attention to the same corrupt folks - cos they are all mates.', "Lol 😂. I'm bk here after watching Ghilaine documentaries on more 4. What I took from that was - Prince Andrews friend was as I thought, as complicet & as responsible as Epstein,  that without her the entire operation couldn't have worked. And after first report to FBI in 1996, that money, power & status let it go on so long. And that all involved including Andrew believed there would ever be any responsibility looked at from them, & they could continue thinking no one would believe these young girls. I fs would love to see Ghilaine Maxwell in prison 😂."]
You weren't that close but you had to end the "not close relationship" with someone in a different country in person ..... yeah right!!  Does he really expect us to believe that!!!! / []

He has the "um" disease also. As of 2:55 he's said dozens of ums. Many in the same sentence. / []
Prince Andrew has no self awareness and out of touch of reality which begs the question Why would his handlers ever allow this interview to happen. The result of this interview is exactly what should have been predicted therefore blocked from happening. Even the Royals are not immune to mental health issues. / []
Can't wait to see Netflix's take on these shenanigans in The Crown season 10, right after the depiction of MeganHarry leaving the Royal family in season 9 😃 / []
He doesn't sweat? How did he think that was a good answer? / []
Royal inbreeding!? This is totaly absurd! Is this person equipped with a 5year old mind? Or less how on Earth! Did he manage Beeing in THE navy? Or anything else? Talk about world Beeing upside down! Theres lot of Good deecent folks! Having a Hard Time surviving! And then theres these kind of entities! Totaly not! Deserving their position! Its Time! To clean Up! These so Called elites way of living! / []
After watching this and seeing recent developments, I wouldn't be surprised if he has an 'accident' prior to the trial, probably in the US..... Like Epsteins suicide, I suspect that would be very convenient to a great many powerful and influential people that he may remember at 'dinners'. / []
... Wow. Flawless execution. 💯 / []
Prince Andrew,   War hero: Falklands active duty. Playboy lifestyle and very blind to the real world. Alleged to have had relations with a 17 year old. Depending on where this took place legality varies “if we go by the standard law of the land” ie you follow the laws of the country you are in.  So far no evidence has emerged of any other girls/women being involved in inappropriate sexual abuse/assault/rape. So far only the one woman has come forward and I’m hesitant to throw him under the bus. If there is evidence he went to the island he should be hung drawn and quartered. However this interview was a disaster, but then we don’t move in their circles, like it or not these people are involved in complex business deals and global programs that we are not privy too. By birth right, default or because they’re elected by us the people.  The problems we face globally are because we think that the way forward is big government when in fact more localised government and management of resources and assets would be far more beneficial to us the people.  Of course I buy his interview, I think he is just a bumbling rich higher class fool who was easily manipulated into taking invites and wanting to be part of what they now call themselves the global elite, imagine being the “spare” and seeing yourself and family becoming more and more irrelevant especially when you’ve been looked upon as almost the social status to look to achieve to find yourselves becoming more and more irrelevant. Trying to elevate your status and building relationships in their world is their way of building relevance and remaining in the public eye. Imagine he would have been possibly the poorest and least important person at the dinner party, but he was a link to the royal family. That’s the only reason that he was even brought into their cabal.  We need to stop targeting him as an individual and realise that this is a bigger problem that needs us to wake up, over throw our current way of doing things and establish a way for us the people who these elites have so much control and power over Have a look at what Russel brand has to say  They’re going to war with Russia next, without a remit from us  The whole Russia problem stems from USA global policy which was set out by lobbyists and yea George Soros (again)  The problems we have as a society globally comes from giving too much power to people who are easily corruptible / []
How do you look at a pic and say “this picture looks like it was taken upstairs and I’ve never been upstairs” … oh… ok… / []
He might be able to pull the wool over the eyes of the kingdom, but out here not so much. I love this interview, watch it everytime I see it.  Just because, he really thiks he good,  and he believes his favorite saying,. " You can't touch me, l'm Royal ", / []
He invited chomos 2 his daughters birthday! I’m embarrassed that my maiden name can be tracked back to the son of a Welch Chieftain! My intentions were to honorable!? My thought are ur feckickg kidding me! For the love of God! Please God destroy this evilness! The duchess was away! Poor Fergie! Proud of you to get you and your girls away from this pos! / []
Andrew uses too many words which makes me think he has something to hide. He should just be cut and dried and tell the truth about Virginia, whatever it is.  I think denying it makes everything so much worse. Furthermore, true massage therapists need to be mature, very educated and experienced. Any modern and decent person is aware of that and would know that young girls are not there for massage, but for other 'services'   It's very sad to hear him explain his version.  I remember one high ranking chap saying officially: I did not have sex with that woman. A bit later he thought better and told the truth and the world got over it I think / []
The problem is with maintaining a public funded constitutional monarchy!! It's full of fake people...who have never been held to account.  Just give them a severance pay...and let them live as private citizens!! / []
You've got to give Andrew the benefit of the doubt here.  PTSD - post traumatic sweat disorder - is a very real thing. Moreover, there's a lot of difference between a birthday party and a straightforward shooting weekend. / ['lolol']

*This is why I support Andrew - my story.  My uncle was a (very bad) paedophile for many years.  I didn't know until 45.*    When I found out what he & his friends actually did, my stomach turned.  I'd stayed at his house many times & met those creeps. I also went to stay with him to tell him I never wanted to see him again & I'd report him if I had to.  Yes, I chose that.    *When you are living overseas, it all changes.  I feel for Andrew.  He got exploited as cover & has been trapped for money.* / []

Does he need to stay in someone else's house? All poor excuses and the truth is evident but the lady accusing him is as degenerate as he is / []
I believe he had relations with that girl and other girls at Epstein's, as a royal prince soaring his oaths enjoying the attention from those star struck girls, NOT as a rapist or sex trafficker. I really don't think he slept with those girls knowing that they were trafficked or with the intention to sexually assault them.   I do think Epstein&Co realised andrew was a gullible royal from the world's most famous royals, yearning for fame, and to have him in their circles would up their "street cred", so they took full advantage of his gullible grewup-in-a-royal-bubble-all-my-life self. They could tell he had no experience about being in the "real" world with "real" people, outside of that royal bubble . He was being used, a victim of his own privileged position and spoilt upbringing, had fun while it lasted now the chickens are coming home to roost. Where were his royal "nannies" why didn't they shield him from such exploitation, or were they equally just as gullible too.   One's past indiscretions always has a way of catching up with one. IMHO his only crime was guilty by association, immorality and promiscuity, not sex trafficking or sexual assault. His nervousness and callousness during this interview reveals just what a gullible easy target for exploitation he is. If this interview was a courtroom, he'd be found guilty as hell and jailed.   I have utmost empathy to victims of rape or sexual assault, I just wonder why would the lady who accuses him, expose herself to the same encounters thrice. / []
Lying prick lol That's pretty much your royal family in a nuttshell. And this is just one thing that came out. Imagine all the things they've done that haven't come out.. / []
I got as far as the 7th minute - really a poor decision- all started with the crooked tie! / []

11:45 the mask drops a little / []
I don't believe he's a liar. I think what he is or was is, terribly naive and self serving, easily led and manipulated, and oblivious to the dangerous sides of people and life.

If this filthy P.O.S. thinks that “U.S. eminence” is academics, politicians, and people from the United Nations…then he never, ever melded with his fellow servicemen.  U.S. eminence is born in the common people, King George - the soldiers, the coal miners, the auto workers, the coders, the teachers, etc…not the elitist, woke, liberal snobs that exist in your fairytale world and don’t give two sh*ts about the average American.  The United Nations is pure evil…a bunch of lobbyists representing dictators.  Acadmics have never spent a day in the real world and with a real job.  And politicians - don’t get me started.  This perv needs to find a high plank and walk off.  To his fellow servicemembers in the U.K. - feel free to comment here and defend this pedo.  Come on, good man…take your best shot at defending this privileged, no-nothing, hypocrite.  He sexually abused an underage girl because he covorted around with a known trafficker AFTER he got out of prison.  The Queen should follow tradition and have him beheaded as her last act of state.  I would respect that.  Anything less - to quote Andrew here - is “the chicken’s way of doing it”.  Or if she doesn’t do it - as Charles first act of state, he should definitely follow long-standing British tradition and have his brother beheaded.  Almost Shakespearean.  Let’s give Virginia Roberts the justice she deserves after all these many years!!!  This interviewer did a magnificent job - but there were so many questions that she should have asked.  One obvious one - did you ever have sex with anyone in any of Jeffrey Epstein’s homes or Ghislaine Maxwell’s homes?  From there - you know they were ONLY underage!!!  Pedos need to be found and dealt with!!! / []

I can't believe his lawyer let him do this interview. So self incriminating. So damning. The "I couldn't sweat" and his alibi for the night of dancing at the bar... the night at home with the girls and take out pizza was so memorable that he remembered if after somebody had reminded him about it. OMG. Ship - sunk. / ['The fact is that his people tried everything they could to make him to not do this interweave.  But Andrew refused to listening at them for some strange reason.

He stayed at Epstein's house in New York even though he knew that Epstein was a convicted paedophile because he thought it was "the honourable thing to do". After all, as everyone knows, hanging out with paedophiles is very honourable. 😂 / ['Lol yeah…hanging around with a paedophile , trying to hide for not being seen, like when they filmed him- and he was looking around him for not being seen, in his house..that’s all about honorably, of course, lol']

He s such a liar, how can’t people see it.  He says he had to go and see Epstein to show “leadership”  Leadership to who”. He is a snivelling, privileged little creep, sorry, just my opinion. Also my opinion, after the queen dies, just get rid of the lot of them.  See how well they get on n the real world. / []

Prince Andrew could always try to establish a new career in Public Relations. / []
A bit of a train crash, but not nearly as bad as I thought given the publicity. The Pizza Express bit has been misreported a lot, he merely noted that was why he remembered he had been at home that night because of that event, not that it was an "alibi". If he truly was sleeping with girls he believed had been trafficked, I can't see why he would have answered the questions the way he did. Clearly he did not rehearse his answers though. I can't see a truly guilty person giving such an interview, at least not with some of those answers / ['That’s right! There’s a simple explanation for all of this I’m sure. Andrew was eh…. I mean it was eh…she was eh.., I think the defence lawyers are gonna be busy put it it that way.']
Watched for second time, probably got interview questions in advance and was coached on how to answer and what words to use and avoid, cannot believe his line of defence is sweating. He stated never been upstairs but knew where photo was taken and was staying there, so many contradictions. Think he may need to get his wondering hand looked at as who knows where it will land next 🤔 / []

Well it's  me in the picture but it's a photograph of a photograph of a photograph and I'm not one who ever shows affection in public.  You Royal Highness thank you very much   No sweat. / []

1) Andrew could not be bothered to express any sort of sympathy for the numerous victims of Epstein's predatory conduct; and 2) to the end, "Randy Andy" Mountbatten-Windsor remainded rather proud of his association with that Ghislaine sheila...until Wednesday the 26th of 01/2022, when he basically disavowed his close ties with the now-convicted adolescent human female trafficker. / []
He was a plus 1 but you felt like you had to go to his house to end your friendship? If she was your main friend and not him this makes no sense. / []

You know, and I think that I can speak for everyone, The Good Prince appears to have defended himself quite well indeed.  He was able to Shut Down the Snarky News Reporter rather convincingly.  I think too, as most everyone probably does, that it would appear that the News Reporter Lady may have been interested in having a Sexual Encounter with His Royal Majesty.  She's partially unbuttoned her top for goodness sake !  I know that The Prince can turn on the Charm, so it's not really the Reporter Lady's fault for saturating herself and leaving the fabric chair seat with a puddle stain. / ['LOL JK']
Of course it has been damaging to the Queen, her son has been noncing / []

With this interview was a real  Disaster for him and then what's coming out now as a bully and treating the staff of the palace screaming at the staff...but this interview was the nail in his coffin and had no  Sympathy for the girls his friend Jeffery Epstein was abusing young girls...and now he is lying though his teeth...and knowing that their is a photo of him and Virginia Roberts Giuffre and telling everyone its was doctored...yeah right doctored so the date on the photo was even doctored...he is guilty as hell / []
this interviewer is a beast. the FBI should take lessons from her, how to interrogate child molesters.. / []
48.07 is where she corrects him he was not "unbecoming" but was a sex offender. madam lost her shit in a british way(politely) / []
Haaaaaa..you fuckin numpty. . / []
What also gives him away is that he’s surprised to hear Brockman was at the house, as if that’s somehow worse than anything Epstein did. Also, if he doesn’t know Mr Brockman, why is he so surprised to hear he was there? That’s evidence enough to assume he’s lying, I think. If it wasn’t obvious already / []
Convenient place to stay? Lol. You can rent a penthouse in nyc? / []
Ohhhh The grand old Duke of York, he wants some kids to pork!  He nonced them up to the top of the hill and he nonced them down again!  He went to Epstein's Island, he nonced like it was Thailand, he nonced them up to the top of the hill and he nonced them down again!  Without his Mumsie's powers, he's scared of prison showers: his poor backdoor can't take any more and his inmates buy him flowers! / []
I remember watching something about body language and talking about how words disagree with the person's expressions. When he says on 50 seconds 'I'm delighted to see you today', that doesn't look like the face of a delighted person. / []

"There's a medical condition that says I didn’t do it, so therefore..."

I you look very very closely... You can see that his pants are on fire.... / []
When asked about the photo, he said "that's me but whether that hand is mine...". Lol. He followed with "the photograph is taken upstairs and I've never been upstairs". Also, "as a Royal, I don't display public affection" and "if it was taken in London, it can't be me as I always wear a suit and tie and in that photo I'm not". Lol. Omg.. this is crazy / []
I don’t like Andrew but I don’t think he is guilty . Why were these girls allowed to travel with Epstein by their parents in the first place / ['Victim shaming, unbelievable!.\nAt some point they would of had to do something they didn’t want to.', 'Alexander Again your victim blaming and shaming, it’s terrible.

It’s amazing how your body doesn’t allow you to lie. / ['Truth.']
There's a definite nuance of some old British comedy/comedians creeping through this "interview," perhaps Rowan Atkinson and Pamela Stephenson Connolly out of "Not the Nine 'o clock News". The absolute vacuum of self awareness Andrew carries around in place of honesty and earnestness... the hubris already mentioned. He's like a self proclaimed vegan guru of thirty years sitting down to chat about how He's discovered game meat and poultry from the country doesn't count as meat owing to it's country freshness and the manner in which it's slaughtered, and in any case he's been eating country killed meat for decades now, dear, with no ill effects, so he's here to advise everyone of the suitability of such protein. After all, if it wasn't for his noble but  naive  inability to lie about such important issues no-one would now be benefiting from it. - Prat. / []
The look of shock on his face at 13:43 in when the name of John Brockman was mentioned who saw Andrew having a foot massage by a "young Russian woman" totally caught Andrew out, "So John Brockman's statement is false"? Emily Maitlis asks and his pathetic defense to this allegation is to deny it and fumbling for an alibi added  " I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I don't know Mr.Brockman so I don't know what he's talking about", fortunately, John Brockman clearly does. Maitlis gave Andrew enough rope and with his arrogance and pathetic lies, he hung himself for the world to see, the idiot even said after the car crash interview that he thought "it went quite well", lol. / []
"Watch what they do, not what they say." / []
“I categorically deny getting a foot massage from a young Russian girl…  . . . I suspect she may have been Romanian!” 😂 / ['🤣🤣🤣 and around the age of 12', 'Nonsense.

He's a pure pervert. Hiding behind his mummy. / []
You have to be careful who you associate with in life don't you?  Prince Andrew's association with Ghislaine Maxwell (and the 'plus 1'of Jeffrey Epstein) was truly, truly devastating.  Associations can destroy a person.  Tread lightly, very lightly.  He must've been a virtual prisoner in the Royal House after a while because of all this crap.   Be careful who you go out with, just stay in the house for the night, before you're forced to stay in your house anyway after people find out who your friends are. / []
This didn't help Prince Andrew.  I mean, as the months or years go by it really shows primarily through the latter conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell.  Like in this interview, he says he knew Ghislaine, not him.  You know?  But now that she's been convicted, now that makes that statement look truly bad too.  Like this interview, as time goes by, gets worse and worse for him. / []
Good  bye  Andy 👋 / []

Just throwing it out there, but I would ask Virginia Roberts if she knew of the British Royal Family (seen pictures, heard stories, watched the news re) prior to her alleged encounter with Prince Andrew.  The reason being:  could it be that someone who looked like Prince Andrew slipped into bed with her and called himself Prince Andrew but wasn’t really Prince Andrew?  I’m not sure why they would do this, other than to bring down Andrew (who, I admit, is a self-centered prat) or because it furthered Epstein’s business contacts?  I’ll always believe the victim, but just wondering if there could be another explanation. / []
Interviews are nothing but stupid questions!!! You know what stupid questions are!!! Here's a good  question!! Do you think fergie is pretty???  My answer is yes!! Many people  don't even see how beautiful some ladies are!!! She has been married and inspired by you to write books learned how to fly and also smile in tough days.!!!!! / []
This would be ridiculously hilarious if it wasn’t about such a serious topic. I’m surprised he didn’t add a line about “See the problem with that is, that couldn’t have happened as I didn’t at that time which has since been rectified a human part to commit any acts with” / []
Based on this alone, the Royal Family should be abolished. Is this the talent they produce? I must be missing something. I am not shocked, l am horrified. Is this actually real or am l watching a Rory Bremner Royal mockup. Jesus Christ!!!!! / []
Prince Andrew, the second Jimmy Savile / []
I’m happy something is finally happening about this. This scumbag needs prison. / []
My favorite part of the interview, and the most telling in my opinion, is when they're talking about his sweating. He says he had a medical condition that prevented him from sweating, caused by having too much adrenaline when he was shot at during war. Here he's trying to gain the respect and sympathy of the viewer by talking about his military experience. He says "....I don't sweat, or I didn't sweat at the time", then he pauses, seems to think about what he was saying, as if to make sure he's saying the right thing, mumbles something, then continues "yes, I didn't sweat at the time". He's trying to be sure he's making the correct claim, that he didn't sweat.  Anhidrosis is a very serious medical condition. If you're unable to sweat, you can die of overheating and heat stroke. So this is very much a medical condition that has to be monitored and treated. This would be easily provable by his medical provider. His attempt to disprove Virginia Giuffre's claim that he sweated profusely during their encounters, has backfired beautifully. He claimed a potentially deadly medical condition that would require medical supervision and treatment, that he's unable to prove, thereby PROVING her account of the situation. He thought he was untouchable because his mommy is the queen. Well look at how the mighty have fallen. Look at all of the situations and scandals the royal family have been a part of, and this is where the queen drew the line. If this interview occurred today, the interviewer would get to leave off the "his royal highness" bit! You know you've failed miserably when you make Charles look like the better man, and the good brother! / ["I knew a boy growing up with this condition. It's immediately what i thought of.", 'Haha so true!', 'literally the part I laughed out the loudest.', 'Amen', 'Nice armchair psychoanalysis']

Sorry Andy I do not believe that u kick urself everyday for sticking by a convicted child rapist. U are nothing but an entitled spoilt priveleged layabout who has never worked a day in ur life never got ur hands dirty and had everything handed to u on a silver plate. I cannot respect any human who calls another human ur Majesty doffs their cap tugs the forelock and only speaks when spoken to. The Queen is fine the rest are a bunch of wasters. Members of the Royal family in the past flirted with Fascism were drug addicts  alcoholics paedophiles rapists murderers read ur history and all were protected in the name of Queen and country defense of the Realm.

The British monarchy is a stone cold horror show.the fact that it took two years for some consequences after this appalling display is disgraceful. If your answer to the question "is it possible that you had sex with any 17 year old girl at the time" isn't "absolutely not, i would never have sex with a minor, it is a fundamentally abhorrent and reprehensible violation" then you are a scumbag. How on earth did he fuck up that question so badly, how did his media team not prepare him for that, its just completely bizarre. The lack of self awareness on display is just extraordinary. / []

An advocate for ending abuse against children felt he owed his friend’s boyfriend, a convicted pedophile, the courtesy of ending their friendship in person?

Also, I never said he faced criminal charges.\nWhat I find telling is that as a resident of Australia, she's decided to file in a US court and not a British one. This is almost certainly due to the fact that her claim would have to backed up by a criminal investigation meaning that her allegations would be put under much greater scrutiny and the UK age of consent would come into play. \nI'm also looking forward to her trying to explain why she didn't scream or even ask for help as she was shuttled through multiple immigration screenings at the various airports she travelled to and why she willingly stripped naked and got into a bathtub with Andrew present. \n\nTake your meetoo blinkers off and ask questions then you might discover that Guiffre isn't what she appears to be."]
Makes me sick.    Epstein was a monster.  Any man that preys on young underage girls deserves the firing squad !!!!    I will never believe Andrew did not touch any young girls.  If given the opportunity most men will if they are positive they can get away with it.   Epstein was not about just parties.   He was into girls, not women. Andrew you look guilty as Hell.  The more you talk, the bigger the hole is getting. ⚫️ / []
THE thing is how far dos this thing go how many people at the top are involved / []
He really is a bad actor and liar..... totally uncertain.... stuttering every time... very embarrassing / []
Innocent until proven guilty / []
The fact Prince Andrew was involved only goes to show you just how high up this goes. Many more powerful people are involved and will payoff or kill off whoever they need to protect themselves. I’d never speak to this sicko again if he was my father. / []
Why did Andy not feel angry with the questions? / []
Get rid of all the royals and the rest of the entitlement parasites. Especially the Lords. / []
I think he wants to jump her bones. / []
Why would Andy freak out if his 72 teddy bears were not in the proper order? Most of all, why does he even have teddy bears? He obviously has a weird obsession with puppets & stuffed animals.

I am getting total liar, liar pants on fire vibes. As Prince Andrew faces a civil sex assault case in the US, it is convenient the queen stripped him from his HRH title and his military roles at this point and time. Is it because he's dishonored the royal family and those roles he upheld; is it to save face with future backlash from tax-paying citizens feeling they are paying for his defense; is it to make it appear that he brings in less income in the case there is a monetary judgment (they probably settle out of court before a judgment was made, to keep it from being public record), is it because a mother knows when their kids lie... I wonder about Prince Andrews' assets, if any, have been signed over to anyone since this scandal began. Or is it they all belong to the Queen/Royal Family. / []

Everyday I am more and more disgusted by ‘Dandy Andy’. How could his ruthless antics have gone on for so long? I am not a MeAgain fan at all, but it makes me question why she was the one called a bully. Clearly, PA was the bully. He was enabled his entire life and allowed to get a way with bad behavior. His arrogance and entitlement we’re left unchecked. He is a product of his environment, so now they are left having to deal with the consequences of raising a spoiled brat. With more and more people coming forward and sharing their interactions with him, it paints a picture of his true character. I would not be proud to call him family. / []

This is why you can't have entitlement and privilege woven into the fabric of a modern society, the blatant injustice of it trickles down and poisons all other institutions.

We in Britain, the US and Canada are considered to be equal before the law and we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before the courts. Over the past few decades this has been. and continues to be, eroded by the media and just general gossip and distortion of facts. Personally, I will not participate in this firestorm. The newspapers and the internet are not the courts. If there is a criminal investigation on anyone no matter who then it is up to the courts to determine the guilt or innocence of a person, any person. The same applies to the sentencing of anyone found to be guilty of a charge or charges. Just as in a rape case the habits of the victim are not the issue; the issue is the conduct of the person facing the allegations before the courts. If we continue to allow these trials by allegations then none of us is safe before the tsunami of gossip, ignorance and the power of the State. / []
I wonder what he “learned” because of Epstein?🤣 / []
He can’t call a guy that he’s “barely friends with “ that he can’t be seen with him 🤣WTF!!🤣 / []
What a joke of a human. Get in a prison cell now / []
I honestly think he has a learning disability.. / []
Can't say what he did was right...But get real folks. She was seventeen. Not seven....I lost my virginity when I was fourteen. My partner at the time was thirteen.  She's never filed a suit against me. Ha ! think she liked it...I'm more pissed off with women whom, several years later, run to the press to make some money. Kiss & tell cry baby ... Ughhh / []
You can see right through him, a man who is guilty 😂 / []
Andrews 🤮 / []
Who are all the other public figures that had sex with the underage girls? and why is only Prince Andrew the one being publicly accused? Why focus on Prince Andrew and not name the others as well!? Something is not right here. / ["He's the escape goat."]
Look at this guy.  TRYING to clear his name , he's denying so much that he is now starting to look like he is definitely involved. / ['Epstein leaves his NY residence with a .. what looks like 16 year old in tow...then, another young girl leaves and theres " Didn\'t see nuthin Andy" waving her goodbye  through the crack in the door.. and this is AFTER Epstein has been convicted for being a  rock spider. Like,  I am trying hard  to believe.. ie.  they are just young hookers...and I can understand a guy making an initial  mistake and then GTFO..... but Andy just kept going back ..even to the dudes house....even to pedo island.. for what?  It is getting so hard for me to give this dude the benefit of the doubt ... seeing what I am seeing.. A prince , well .. anyone..... seeing and staying  at a pedos house is beyond me.... it\'s absolute madness .. honourible? My a_ss']
If i didn‘t know any better, i would think this was a parody and not the original interview. / []
What about these minimum wage maids with open openings in the Castle have they been questioned could be a loophole for young girls that seems to be there thing. You can’t trust them that’s for sure. / []
Ex prince did proof one thing, his sense of morality way of the truck, by the way  he is stupid too! / []
This should be a non-topic, she was 17! Also this many years later no one can prove anything, if they did or didn't have sex. He might be a bit of a player but he hasn't committed any crime. / []
My 5 year old brother can lie better then this / []
Boy i sweat so much maybe i should be shot at and I'll be cured 🤣🤣🤣 and he doesn't show PDA so how did you get the nickname Randy Andy in the 70s 🤷‍♀️ / []
Why did she have sex with him 3 times? / []
Watch his breathing. It's shallow and erratic. That just gives it away. Body language never lies. / []
So this rich prince could not afford a place to stay? Or a hotel in the area where his events were?! Liar, liar royal pants on fire! He knows of Epstein’s convictions and still has a relationship with a pedophile! Enough to make me sick! He has two daughters! Did he ever once think how he would feel if someone abused his daughters? Any parent of worth would never let a pedophile or trafficker near their children! / []
"He had the most extraordinary ability to bring people together!"  What you forgot to add to the end there, Andrew, was "...for noncing." / []
if only there was a  polygraph in that room ... / []
L / []
How can you agree theres something going on with him but not you when the evidence is coming from the same person.... the maths dose'nt add up... / []
She has him completely fucked from the start brilliant how can you sit there and dispute photographic evidence lol / []
lol, the Brits love them, good luck with all that / []
HRH Prince Andrew is a noble man. A very decent kind and extremely honest individual. He is telling the truth. He has never been a party guy, he is just friendly and polite , he is gregarious but not boisterous. Its obvious he values all his friendships they become very personal to him as he is grateful for the opportunities & knowledge it has provided to what matters to him. He did not want Epstein to feel as if he used him and without understanding it all for himself before he made a judgement call he decided to visit Epstein and hear it all from him instead of relying on the media for accuracy. / []
EVEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO FLING IN A PIZZA EXPRESS 🍕 / ['PS. WITH THE KIDS 😳']
I heard he was f..ing maxwell as well. Between that and the alleged homosexual relationship between epstein and former president clinton  it seems like they were all part of a sex cult. / []
Thank fuck the Queen said "Hard No". That poor lady has had a lot happen in the last year. I feel for her. / []
Why hasn’t he been publicly asked to say whose party Beatrice was at, and get verification from that person? / []
I've never been upstairs at Ghislaine's,.... Immediately explains how he knows its upstairs at Ghislaine's. / []
I do not believe the young lady she is looking a big pay day . / []
He said he didn't  know the  police was investigating  Epstein  did he think it was father xmas  such an idiot. / []
Shed load of absolute total and utter Bollocks. / []
He was closest enough  with Epstein  to abuse  a young 17 yr old girl. / []
Epstein behaved in a way "unbecoming" 🤣 / []
“But you were staying out the house of a convicted sex offender.” But it was so convenient! LordT. 😒 The British people give their tax money to these people and for what? Where’s the honor in any of them? / []
The comedy event of the decade. Seriously John Cleese, take your mask off, you are killing me.  This cant be a real interview. Seriously given the circumstances, this is also the worst thing I've ever seen. / []
13:41 / []
Epstein wasn't a "real friend", he was only friends with him through Madam Maxwell; however, he WAS such good friends with him that he took an international flight ✈  to "do the honorable thing" by ending his  friendship with him in person. 🤷🏼‍♀️ / []
Indian Equivalent : Rahul and Arnab / []
Looooooooooooooooool / []
29:43 / []
The way he says "No recollection" and you almost expect he clap his hands together and follow up with, "Well then, I'll be off now."   What a clown / []
Andrew deserves jail / []
Oh! This dude is a lying 🤥 / []
Just about EVERY SINGLE WORD coming out  of this greedy, over-fed, paedophiles mouth IS A LIE ....  One more reason to collapse the british monarchy. / []
he is guilty 😉 in some ways. well done interview Emily and 👍! / []
the royal family needs to banish him, he must spend the rest of his days donating his money to victims of sexual assault, there is no better outcome / []
I think it’s a risky thing to for royalty to be playing with fire,honesty would lead to trusting him and public trust,i suppose he is a saint in that case, / []
This video is now widely used in introductory courses on interrogation and how to determine when a person is lying. / ['Hahahahaha! He’s such an embarrassment to our country.']
Give the guy a break / []
He traveled from England to the United States for the sole purpose of telling him "they should not be seen together", and proceeded to be "seen together".  Ever heard of phones dude? / ["He's too honorable for phones!", 'He didn’t want what he really had to say to be recorded on the phone or for there to be phone records of the call. He didn’t take into account that Epstein would have a photographer document the meeting. Epstein was covering his ass. Andrew was trying to cover his.']
Lying toe rag of a man. Says he wasn’t good friends with Epstein and it was all through Maxwell. But he felt the need to go and visit Epstein and tell them their friendship is over “to show leadership”. Then playing with dates and arguing semantics. Terrible and quite frankly disgusting. You were friends, he was in your inner circle, you thought his power would see him through the accusations  and you absolutely had sex with the girls delivered to the houses. At least just say you thought Epstein was innocent and show a bit of this “leadership” you go on about for your actions. What a slithering little scrote / []
you tube keeps giving... someone came up with this LMAO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgKiiCPb7LM / []
Clearly lying. He is a viper. / []
He never denies that anyone was ever trafficked to him, ever, not even in his entire life.  He only says that he can't remember. / []
Wow so obviously guilty and a total liar, “art the time I had a condition where I could not sweat at all, but I can now” / []
The most frightening thing is he actually believes what he's saying! Self deceit is a Narcissistic trait. / []
I hate it when I’m too honourable. / []
Ask yourself this. If he was guilty of the allegations why did he just not say. “I was a single man and she told me she was above the age of consent” Far easier than saying “I never met her.” Even the famous photograph is a copy of a copy, where is the original? We all know what we can do with ‘photoshop’ / []
All I hear is ... eeeehm eeehm eeehm eeehm... sorry thats bad 🤷🏻‍♀️ / []
Guilty as fuck. / []
This man deserves whatever comes to him... shambolic representation of the truth.. For a man with all his security and staff, he doesn't really know much at all based on his answers... classic avoidance techniques on display for all to see...   If he wasn't THAT close to Epstein why stay at a known sex offenders house for 4 days, have a dinner party at a known sex offenders house, stroll in the park with a known sex offender and then the audacity to say "we weren't that close" - assuming that Ghislaine wasn't even present all these times - the cheek to say he had to go and see him to tell him I can't be seen with you anymore..lol...IF YOU WEREN'T THAT CLOSE WHY GO AND SEE HIM?!?!?   I wish my friends boyfriend was that generous and I didn't have to be THAT close to him to use all his amenities and private jets.. all this coming from a man who has been awarded anything from birth.. yuck! Absolute lack of accountability is all I'm hearing wrapped up in lies / []
I don't sweat??? / []
Biggest load of codswallop I've ever seen. Liar liar pants on fire. / []
I actually have to go tell my child sex trafficking acquaintance that we’re no longer friends. I’ll probably make a trip of it. / ['Lol summed up perfectly!', 'He could’ve ended the ‘friendship’ with a phone call… but oh no - that would be impolite…😂 much more civilised to break the friendship in person, and stay for FOUR days!!! The stupidity and vileness of this man is mind blowing', "Well if its in NY you'll have to. No hotels there so it will be a convenient place to stay 😂"]
Tendency to be too honourable 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Actually, Funny enough! Wtf! / []
A bone in his neck!!!!!! He has something to do with JE demise! He just gave himself away with that! / []
Just fantastic fantastic tv 😂👍 / []
12:38 "My judgement was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable" Is this guy serious? / []
"Certainly, going to Jeffrey's wasn't about parties, absolutely not."  Oh, Andrew, the public is WELL aware of that fact. Epstein's partners and other clients in the SO ring weren't there for the parties either. It's almost insulting how he thinks partying is somehow more offensive than going after underage women. But then I remember the amount of hubris involved in this interview and it all makes sense. / []
He was allowed to stutter and stumble through his blatant lies and I agree she should have pulled him up on what he said that didn’t make sense which was everything he said, but of course she’s a lowly Russian girl and he’s a member of the biggest criminal cartel in the world. Right? / []
Incredible. What a lying toe rag , his past is finally catching up with him . No remorse for the victims of Epstein and he actually thought after it that he had put it to bed ! He must think we are all stupid . Well done Emily for exposing this fool . / []
I'm finding it strange how he states "No - I cannot recall or remember that ever happening" instead of saying "I would never EVER have relations with a trafficked girl, that is extremely immoral" You wouldn’t need to “remember” if you did something that you know you’re incapable of doing! / ['exactly', "When you say you can't remember or recall that ever happening, that brings an end to that particular question. It may be immoral/illegal to sleep with an underage girl, but then that kind of opens the door to question Prince Andrew about his morals and the immoral choices he made in his past. When or how does he pick and choose his morals?", 'KJX : If he\'s found guilty, \nlet\'s just remember\n that many men think\n it\'s o.k. to do bad \nthings to females...\nof all ages, depending\n on the stage of\n pornography they are at .😢.\n The Law of Diminishing Returns \nmakes them become more extreme...\nPlus the " buzz" of being " naughty" , \nsecretive, "risky", it\'s all \npart of the lure to men \nof the bad side of \nmodern human life...\n😠😢😠😢😠😢\n\n\nPaedophiles, traffickers,fetishes,  pimps, there must be millions of men who mostly get away with it...', 'Lol', "SPOILER ALERT: That's because he's guilty :)"]
Hahaha.... at least Jimmy Savile had the dececency to give his children a 🏅 medal.......Randy any only gives out 🧳 badges / []
Lets reflect.not about individuals but too equal this to the businnesses  linking their sales to sexual salvery. This person is not that. In a sense he is tje nations way to say no more.

What a liar ! / []
"I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable" 12:30 / []
@Daniel Billington, you’re still here - talking a lot of nonsense in almost every once comments . Asking if they have problems when you’re the one with the problems all around you / []
OMG !!!! this interviewer is genius..how did she ever keep a straight face ?!  his stuttering, his squirming, his sleezy eyes, his blatent lies .. um um um  .. / []
I really hope that i reads the comments So he understands how he fucked up / ['Daniel Billington when he reads your comments - friends like you -']
The best part of him dribbled down his mother's leg. We hate you Andrew, you're a fu¢¥ing disgrace. / []
13:43 he's like "oh fuck"👀 / []
Andy has 2 brain cells and they're both fighting with each other.  This is really who is sucking all of England's  hard earned tax dollars? / []
Lock him up / []
I have zero recollection of ever voting him in any sort of office or position of power. / []
Is he trying to hold back a smile about 0:18secs in? / []
I am calling BS BS BS! / []
Prince Andrew was ambushed by this so called journalist; I remind everyone, he is there of his own volition.  Let the chips fall where they may, but he is not proven guilty of anything.  Epstein was also a power broker so it's no big deal that he entertained the likes of the Prince, Clinton et al. / []
Emily conducted this interview exceptionally well / ['Daniel Billington oh yes she did']
I think it’s time he admitted being with vaginia whether he knew she was below the age of consent or not. As for the bigger picture, I don’t believe he had any more involvement in anything more sinister and I feel really sorry for him. Prince Andrew has always done a lot of good and whilst this is certainly not his finest moment, I don’t believe he was knowingly doing wrong and I hope I’m right. That said, the gruelling truth will come out in due corse and then there’ll be no unanswered questions. / ['The lawsuit in Manhattan is going into discovery this summer. He’s going to settle out of court to avoid the proof coming to light.', '@tieiatalks I heard that G the women, said she is going to drop every name now.']
The problem with this interview is that he thinks he is clever and absolutely untouchable, which has turned out to not be true at all. / ['Daniel Billington yes he’s a spoiled little brat. So No, troll']
this is a perfect example of a pompous ass that has been raised in total privilege.  He has never in his life been challenged or questioned by anyone - ever. All the bootlickers that have surrounded him his entire life will agree with whatever lying dribble comes out of his mouth.  How dare anyone question a Prince?  If he said it, it must be true. / []
How do you go tell a person y'all not friends when you say he was a plus 1 to your real friend his girlfriend / ['Daniel Billington I understand perfectly']
When asked if he had regrets, he  described Epsteins relationship with him as beneficial and politely called his rape scandal as unbecoming, then immediately called his own behavior unbecoming. Clearly he holds his dead friend in high regared and committed the same 'unbecoming' acts. / []
Whenever a person says that he has no memory of something — instead of flat-out denying it —it means that he is afraid that evidence of the truth may eventually come out. Thus saying he has no memory of it, is a way of covering his ass in case he gets busted in the future. / []
When my brother used to lie as a child he made the same low eyebrows scrunched “confused” face… who does he think he’s fooling? / ['Daniel Billington …. I mean I think there’s been enough come out to discern a large shadow of doubt over prince Andrew. His body language alone is not that of a honest person. I don’t think you made a very strong argument for what you are trying to suggest.', 'Daniel Billington  what? 😅 whatever your trying to argue, you’re doing a poor job of it.']
I am still stunned how his handlers allowed him to be interviewed. Classic " I do not remember " was the correct answer. Then a " When I was single and younger I was a bit of gadabout." Many single people want to hang with us.  No! I never knew anyone was under 21. Jeffery "Epstein" said these are employees of mine and their friends and family. Jeffery said. I don't et anyone here under 21 because so everyone can drink and have a goodtime. Sounded reasonable to me. Everybody here is looking to have a goodtime. So I did. I did not see one person not enjoying themselves. Now 20 plus years later people are not who they say they were?   Prince Andrew never was told . When Guilty ! Shut the hell up! / ['Daniel Billington But yet You choose to comment?', 'Daniel Billington Flex them internet muscles mate!!!!!  FLEX FLEX !!!']
13:43 facial expression is a winner / []
Prince Andrew has told the truth and can't defend himself anymore in public and can only defend himself legally. / []
They really shouldn’t have let him do this interview…he put the nails in his casket / []
Just a straightforward shooting weekend...lol...that's like every weekend for me.  hehehe / []
I’ve never seen someone act more guilty. Will people never learn? Nothing good comes from talking to the press or the police!! That goes for if you’re innocent as well. Never say a word without a good attorney sitting right next to you. / ['Watch Bill Gates interview about it :)', 'Poor Queen. I feel so sorry for her.😓', "Actually, this doesn't go for if you are innocent. If you are innocent, you speak the truth! Let your light shine!", "@WillToWinvlog \nThe police will never let you get away, even if you're innocent; they'll make up something just to stick it to you.", '@roguewave8625 which interview is it bill gates on Andrew ?']
Rule #1 Don't tall to the press about anything?.They should have known that buy know? Rule #2 Don't get married or have sex untill marriage/. All women want is half these days/???   any other rules .. / []
That could not be me in that photograph , at the time I only had sex on first floors.  This was photographed on the second floor. / []
Out of all the possible men invited to Epstein's island, this guy got stuck without a chair when the music stopped. / []
He's looking ancient and troubled. / []
Scotland Yard has likely communicated its considerable evidence to the Firm, which explains its recent and future responses. / []
Sorry but Prince Andrew is dumb.  This was embarrassing regardless if the world turned on him from this interview.  He revealed that he is not noble, not royal, not high class.  He is secular, mundane, atheistic, carnal and myopic.  Just being born into that family doesn't make you royale. / ["Daniel Billington I didn't say anything racist or homophobic.  Prince Harry has to call Prince Andrew uncle?  Prince Harry has to have a father who cheated on his mother and caused her to be in an insecure position which led to her death and caused extreme emotional distress in life.  Prince Charles was also friends with Jimmy Saville.  No wonder Prince Harry left the UK.  He is being emotionally healed in the nurturing environment of California free of narcissism.   Prince Harry is the true royal here.\nPrince Andrew is a disgrace.  It's just sad because you would think that royalty would be truly royal and go to church and pray to God and try to be worthy of God's blessing and hope to inspire the common people with true nobility.", 'Daniel Billington Also Prince Andrew is SO immature. No wonder he went for underage girls.  I respect Prince Harry more and more.  Prince Harry did not want to become that.  Prince Harry walked away from hedonism.']
That walk in the park was traveled on the road to perdition. / ['Daniel Billington hahaha,,,,,well said.']

Jail!!! / []
This guy / []
One thing most people don’t understand is Prince Andrew’s life and the royal family’s life is not like ‘our’ lives. They live by a schedule - this is what he refers to when he talks about the dates. Everything he does is dated in a calendar and is kept for years to come. Before this interview his team checked the calendar dates quoted and he is referring to the descriptions on the calendar. Actually having seen this interview a few times now, I think he is a very weird, pompous and out of this reality guy, but I don’t think he’s lying. He’s being sued for his and the royal family’s wealth. / []
This did not age well. He's, admittedly, a close friend of Ghislaine Maxwell, a now convicted sex trafficker 🤔 What does he have to say for himself now? / []
"I have no recollection."   Says the rapist! / []
This man does NOT have the wits or brains to survive & be a "private citizen." / []
Cry baby Andrew. Mommy can't help you out of this one / []
I wanted to honour a convicted sex offender face to face and decided to stay at his mansion for 4x more nights because it was crowded in his mansion with underaged girls, I hoped to accidentally see him in the hallway so I could honour him again to make sure he understands that I'm such an honourable person. OMG this is so Nobel and Royal! / []
This guy chats the most amount of shit, / []
The lies are just as shameful as the truth. What else do these clowns lie to us about?  Absolutely disgusting. / []
This is literally throwing yourself under the bus / []
Lock him up ! This gimmick of stripping his titles is bullshit. Criminal. / []
Emily was fantastic in this interview / []
Mistake Mistake! But Women should not be aloud to take money while enjoying there time go on holidays wine and dine  then years later when they are fat and no longer attractive exploit these men for money! These man have moved on maybe  now married with children it is completely un fair and should have been investigated years ago / []
This spoilt brat will walk away from this.  "An engaging person". That’s bloody hilarious.  This is a man who screams at staff, is demanding, nasty, and spoilt to the bone.   I’m a UK citizen that lived in NY for 15 years.  I know how USA justice works.  This clown would not be able to dodge summons servers by hiding in his Mother’s homes.    If he was Mr Andrew Windsor and worked in a bank or at Micky D’s he’d be on Rikers Island right now.  Especially if he was an African American.  Police brutality is a dose of what this petulant liar needs.    He claims he stated with Epstein because it was "convenient"?  When you have around 1000 fabulously wealthy New Yorkers plus the best hotels in Manhattan to stay in why go to a children’s brothel?  He states he was being honourable " That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard”. Oh for people who don’t know what this Royal Family is like, if someone breaks the rules or  is indiscreet they freeze them out for life.  The Queen has acted so well in this situation,  I have to give her credit.    I’m not a royalist never have been.  Ultimately he will walk away from this.  The Queen bless her will pay a huge settlement and he’ll walk.  If it was an ordinary man in the street it would become a criminal case and Andrew would be facing jail.  Probably the best thing for him.  He’s basically doing a Michael Jackson here.  He’s a pervert.  His ex wife clings to him as her title is the only thing that guarantees her a regular income.  They are a well matched pair.  Greedy, selfish. Self gratifying and spoilt.  This interview the whole body language is one of a liar.  Very similar to when Prince Charles was asked about infidelity with Parker Bowles.  He looked shifty, eye contact was all over the place blatant lies.  This pervert could have severed all connections but kept going there again and again yet this dim witted pudding can’t see he’s done anything wrong!!  Please put him behind bars!  In America.  I don’t know where the bar is at Tramp lol.  What a liar.  He drinks.    If someone asked me where I was 2 weeks ago I couldn’t tell you.  He remembers Woking said it’s unusual went to pizza express!  Ok well they have private chefs (all of them do) plus why would he drive to pizza express when he has detectives chauffeurs and other minions to do this for him.  This whole interview is a tissue if lies.  He needs to be held accountable.  He doesn’t remember the photo??  Oh please!  Now it’s not his hand now it’s the position it’s just pathetic  Hes posing and smiling saying it’s someone else’s  hand!      Put this idiot behind bars PLEASEEE!   Lies Lies Lies / []
I was always against spin doctors and PR people but this guy needs to learn something about body language 😂 has never had to defend himself in any way and it shows / []
I have quite honestly never seen a worse liar than Andrew 😂 no concept of how normal people speak lol. So utterly see-through. It's hilarious. We all know what's going on, it's obvious, but nothing will be done because of evidence / []
Why on earth would he grant that interview?! 🤯 I thought rich folks have tonnes of smart people giving them counsel on important things 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ / ['His mum probably told him to do so or he’ll get no pocket money', '@rhyst124 Actually, his mum practically disowned him!']

he needs killing the scruff / []
I have watched this Interview over and over he's as Guilty as hell and so Arragarent hope he's Locked up with the other one / []
Now Emily needs to interview Alec Baldwin.  She obviously has a way with malignant narcissists. 😉 / []
Nope, not buying it 🤨 It depends on what the definition of "is" is 😁 / []
The way he goes on about breaking up with Epstein in person sounds like they had an intimate relationship going ... sounds suspiciously like a lie to me. / []
The number of Britons with a sexual interest in children may be seven times higher than previously thought, the head of the National Crime Agency has said. Lynne Owens said the revelation came after investigators scoured through sites for paedophiles on the dark web, finding an estimated 144,000 accounts linked to British people. / []
What coversation WOULD you want with her Andrew? The girl is an underaged prosttute! You have embarrased your mother irreperably. / []
Twice when she referred to Epstein’s death he gave out a big grin & little gafaw of relieve. Very noticeable. / []
“That can’t be my left arm on her waist, because at the time I didn’t have arms!” / ['Oliver Hannan lol 😆', '🤣', '🤣🤣 ur the 🐐 for this one', 'He is hilarious!', "* because YOU SEE I didn't have arms 🤣"]

Prince Andrew must really regret in agreeing to do this interview! / []
I think you got yourself a real life bunny boiler / []
Yes Andrew social media it means you can’t get away with anything anymore you dirty filthy little man. / []
This man is a lying old creep, but this interviewer is awesome ! / []

This man is a really bad lier.  He doesn't know where the bar is and then proceeds to say he never bought a drink when he was there. / ['Daniel Billington 😂😂😂😆😆!']
Lady Colin Campbell is absolutely positive that Prince Andrew did NOT have sex with Giuffre. She claims the case against Prince Andrew is a DEMOCRAT CONSPIRACY.   She says the judge is CORRUPT. The lawyers are CORRUPT. The US JUDICIARY system is CORRUPT. President Clinton is CORRUPT. Hillary is CORRUPT. Ex NY governor Cuomo is CORRUPT.  Even Andrew's  lawyers may be setting him up, but she 's not sure about that. In other words the whole world is against poor, innocent, Prince Andrew and he won't get a fair trial simply because he is a royal.  Of course we all know there is corruption in the court system but poor Lady C seems to see enemies crawling out of the woodwork just to bring down "Randy Andy". Her recent video's only have a nodding acquaintance with the  truth and FACTS are not what interest her.  Is Prince Andrew guilty or innocent ?  I prefer to wait, to see what happens before I shoot my mouth off ! My question is, since Ghislaine Maxwell is in the infamous picture, why can't Prince Andrew get her to give a statement saying if the picture was ever taken ? / ['You know what, I think you’re right. There’s a perfectly good honourable explanation for all of this. We’ll said.']
WTFudge!!??!! Why does a grown a** man have a teddy bear collection? / []
You got caught and now it's time to pay others would be whisked off to face their accuser but you are scared and that's guilt Andrew face her be a man / []
13:45 priceless / ['What is he saying ?🤣']
Haha he called himself "honorable". Called sex positive if you "are a man". Yucks. No wonder Harry and Meghan left this family. / []
His mother knows the truth / ['Backed him up and his bills']
When was your last contact with Her  "It was early this year, funny enough" / []
I hate liers and thieves / []
sorry, but very hard to believe a 17 year old girl can be 'groomed' into having sex. at that age you know about sex and consent etc. fair enough if underage sex took place it should be dealt with appropriately, but just cause it was underage technically, doesnt mean she was a victim of 'trafficking' / []
BUSTED!! / []
so let me get this straight he is filthy rich, money isn't a concern, his whole existence he was spoon fed with gold/platinum spoon & he chooses 2 stay at one of Epsteins homes. I think that says a lot. good 2 know he sweats a lot & has  awful body odor emanating from his pours. I bet the ladies r knocking down his door unable 2 resist the urge 4 some hanky panky. / []
Prince Andrew (and Fergie too) is such a tool. Hopefully, Prince Charles and Prince William are smart enough to distance themselves from him--Prince Andrew is toxic. Prince Andrew will bring the entire monarchy down if they let him. After Queen Elizabeth passes on, he will not have his mummy's skirts, power, money, castles and palaces to hide behind anymore. Prince William is NO dummy, he is not going to let this arrogant self-important entitled pompous buffon take his children's future away. / []
I've never seen anyone more obviously lie. He's realy bad at it / ['Watch Charles on the David Dimbleby interview when he asks about the affair with Camilla!  He asks if Charles had ever stopped seeing that woman “He fidgets squirms eyes flickering and says. “Only when the marriage broke down”. Another huge lie!  Who carries a photo of his mistress on honeymoon?  Calls them everyday, Diana bless her found out before the marriage and hoped she could fight and win.  Unfortunately she was too young facing a woman who had virtually breast fed Charles as well as teaching him sex.  If you listen to the tapes she’s all over Charles like a rash.  That woman was responsible for Diana’s health issues her miserable life.  Charles was a pampered, spoilt petulant man who was jealous of his beautiful kind hearted wife and was vicious to a naive beautiful young girl by a manipulative pair of schemers.  He never stopped seeing Parker Bowles.  The night before the wedding she slept with him at Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn fairness to him she would not let him go.  Reports say that they did have some happy times together but Camilla would call him. Praise him baby him etc.  It turns my stomach.  This woman is now wearing the late Princess Diana’s jewellery, living in her homes and will be Queen or Queen consort wearing now the Order of the Garter highest honour you can receive from the sovereign.  I think there are only 26 members.  Mainly her children and William.  Parker Bowles also wears crown like tiaras subconsciously planting a seed that it’s a small transition from a huge tiara to a crown.  It doesn’t work for me!\n\nThis is a man who wanted to be a TAMPON for heavens sake!   That must tell people what a thoroughly rotten barrel of apples these royal children are!  Adulterers, liars, and pull rank where ever they go.']
Amen to the lady she deserves a pay raise oh yeah and you to Andrew / []
“We were friends bc of other ppl” ohhhh that makes sense, they made you hang out with him 😵‍💫 / ['isnt almost every friend a friend bc of "other people"?']
The Prince is lying eloquently. / []
"Because there is no good time to uhhhhm uhm uhm talk about Mr. Epstein...uhmm" what a blundering idiot / []
My God, he is such a liar. The stumbling over his words, the body language, notice he doesn't make eye contact with the interviewer when he is weaving his tale. And this "breaking up" in person, even though "we weren't that close" what a ridiculous excuse. / ['Sarah Ferguson is having a glass of champagne feeling vindicated']
Had it been any other Tom Dick n Harry, would have been arrested / []
Yep because a prince of England needs Epstein incredible connections !!! BS !! Andrew wanted his connections to under age girls!! He’s a creep and this interview is beyond embarrassing / []
Guilty!!! / []
Lmao this interview ruined his entire life / []
This interview should be released on special edition blu-ray! / []
Prince Andrew is a monster.  He is caught; so, now he is working full-time to spin tales for sympathy.  Not long ago, his network of daddys & bros & media rush to his aid and relentlessly frame others.  De-throned Prince Andrew puts his ego & experience in practice to trap the underage.  Private citizen Andrew Windsor or whatever, is solely to blame for his actions & miserable existence.  I praise the young ladies for being strong & brave in standing up to a monster.  I hail The Queen for the fine decision. / []
Honour? - well actually he was apparently on her and off her all night 🤣 / []
Innocent till proven guilty ! He’s a great target for a woman after a big payday ? / []

BBC interviewer whispers to Prince Andrew: “Your royal highness, your trouser zipper is undone” Prince replies: “I can categorically say that I’m so delighted to see you”. / []
he probably is one of the most disgusting people ive seen interviewed this formally. Interestingly he just digs his own grave / []
@36:55 , he gets a little nervous / []
Ok, yup he did it. And probably much worse. / []
He's guilty 😔 / []
I’ve watched this interview a couple of times now and my initial thoughts from his performance was that he is as guilty as sin. But now after several views I honestly think he is probably telling the truth because he’s just to thick to know what was going on and now finds himself in the shit through association. I don’t think he could ever be a positive action kind of person. He’s just too pathetic. I think he’s being framed for cash. He’s going to have to pay up in the end and his reputation muddied. I’d feel sorry for him if he wasn’t such a prick. / ['💯% agree! \nBut still he has a duty to provide names of prominent people he’s seen there. \nThese were children regardless if they look like adults.\nLook this snowflake is gathering more momentum, snowballing out of control.', '@johndavidson7476 yes true -Lets just hope he has the balls to name names voluntarily. But failing that hopefully the prosecutor’s will drag names out of him. Abusers whoever they are should be named shamed and locked up for good. There is no excuse for abuse.', 'Is that you Fergie.?So who was he waving at leaving  Epstein place caught on video.', "So hes suck u in allso. Making out he didn't know what's going on in Epstein."]
Now just simply Andy Windsor.. / []
This whole interview is like a 6yr trying to lie about eating all the biscuit's. / []
Do you think America will give him sanctuary? / []
You know this is a huge story when thousands if people watch over two years after the fact. Now off to destroy the rest of his pals. She needs to come clean and we need to clean house. / ['Daniel Billington ummmm okay.', "Daniel Billington I have a feeling your hard-drive isn't."]
You'd think he was an American. :( / []
Trial by Media I’m not a fan of Prince Andrew but a man is innocent until proven guilty. We believe what is presented into us but what is really the truth / []
OH so beginning interview - he only accepted use of house on 3 occasions but shortly later ' A great person to have a dinner party with - Politicians, people of power, may INITIALLY GOOD INTENT BUT HE NOW PROVEN LIED! POOR qUEEN / []
If this was all about Ghislaine Maxwell, the "straight up shooting weekend", the invitations, the friendship, why did he go and need to have a proper f***ing breakup with Epstein in NY? And his tactics were so funny cause tried to divert from Jeffrey and didn't think Ghislaine would later be the only one of the two who's officially convicted  😂 This is BBC gold / []
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SUCH A NIGHTMARE / []
Just as well Emily wasn’t drinking water, she could of easily sprayed it out to ever answer he gave.  In fact I might watch this interview again with a few beers at the weekend. / ['John Davidson or choked.!!', 'Sprayed it out of where? Eww...', '@mariolisa2832 Water vapour,\nHappy New year!', '@janeyd5280 yes! choked would be more becoming, in front of HRH Eh…I mean Andy Wettin.', '@johndavidson7476 lol 😆']
One thing I always wondered: being a member of the Royal family, wasn't him constantly briefed by the secret service or similar entities about the people he met? I mean, if not for ethical at least for security reason! Couldn't they "strongly recommend" him not to mingle with certain individuals? I cannot imagine they didn't do it! The story is more complicated than one can tell at a first glance... / ['@RedLemon69 I’m not sure what this reply has to do with the original comment. do you mean that’s one thing you also always wondered? Obviously Americans who were forgotten for their relationship with him have nothing to do with being briefed by the royal family or anything like that so I’m a bit confused', 'Makes sense if you say  all the royals knew then the pieces fit', "There's no way he wasn't warned. Sheer arrogance, what a loathsome, little tapeworm he is.", "It's almost like the secret services had a role to play in Epstein's crimes...", "A member of my mum's church has worked with him (he was in a senior role with police Scotland). He has worked with quite a few royal family members and swears that most are lovely- princess Anne being the nicest. But Andrew is apparently a total dickhead who smarms his way through life and backstabs people. He also knows better than anyone offering advice and is a nightmare to work with. So no doubt he did have people begging him to rethink this. Glad he didn't as this is hilarious to watch"]
You do not appear to look grand anymore,ex grand old duke of York. / []
10:17 "what I was doing" / []
He’s so full of shit, it seems he doesn’t even know how full of shit he is 😂 / []
I don’t get it. How  can it be that  a woman of dubious background , a woman who got to Epstein’s pleasure facilities under her own steam, a woman who procured girls for Epstein , some of whom were as young as 14, can destroy a Royal Prince  with her accusations. Yet the accusations of an entire nation against a man who lied in order  to embroil  them in  an illegal war, cannot stop him from being knighted ? I’d rather see Prince Andrew retain his titles than see Blair knighted . It’s so twisted. Many may say that the prostitute was only 17 and therefore easily manipulated and abused. Yet there are  people incarcerated, many serving  life sentences , some even under sentence of death , who committed their crimes at the age of 17, or younger. Why  can’t they receive the same compassion from the cyber court public that Andrew’s accuser gets ? Why can’t their testimonies be believed like gospel too?  It’s all so twisted, and those of you commenters who have joined the cyber lynch mob, are part of the problem. / ['Prince Andrew could collaborate with the police, FBI, CIA. Who ever. I’ve been to massage parlours in my reckless days, an 9 times of 10 the girls would rather do something else if they were paid the same money.']
I see nothing suspicious here. Totally convincing performance and furrowed brow / []

I have two daughters I’d hate them to get involved in anything remotely seedy like this. My issue is they would of been coerced into something at some point they didn’t want to do. You can take that to the bank. How much business was really done or was it all hedonistic for middle aged gammons. Ok there’s no honour in a prostitute neither is there any in Prince Andrew’s dalliance with a convicted sex offender.']
What a waste......entitled sexual predator... / []
Incredible to see how “categorically” the man looses his voice when asked if he would testify against Epstein.. man is clearly lying 🤥. Nothing new in our world the rich and powerful get their way no matter what and just brush it under the rug. I also don’t believe Epstein committed suicide judging by the autopsy report it is highly extremely rare to have a piece of muscle that sits underneath the chin area to break in a fragmented manner by a bed sheet tied around the neck. This was a highly classified undercover murder that was staged to appear as suicide because imagine the filth that is about to come busting out of all the bad deeds of the rich and famous! Sick just absolutely sick. If he is guilty and of taking part in Epsteins freak show the Creator will catch up with these people. There is huge movement planetary wise that is causing upheaval in all parts of the world where authority that has gone on and abused their powers for the bad are about to get a serving of Karma. God is purging these dark forces from our world that have plagued humanity especially the less fortunate who have been abused at the hands of the powerful. There is only ONE God no one else gets to play his/her role!! ❤️🙏🌟 and your money won’t save you!! / []
Had never been upstairs but he knew where the pic was taken. SICK pervert. You can tell just by watching him how bad he is lying / []
He  don’t even lie good. The need to strip the name prince from him, and he should be ashamed of himself. LIAR. That girl doesn’t deserve this. He is such a loser. / []
32:35 He never denies receiving the daily massages, although he tries to deflect with questioning the number times he visited. / []
I just tried to watch this again. Lasted 5 minits before I could not watch him lie as he did / []
This is Proof Andrew never listens to those whom knows best.  He dug his own grave as soon as he opened his big buffoon mouth. What a right Royal Pratt. / []
I can’t even watch it, I don’t even know what the feeling is that I feel / []
They didn’t teach those royals how to lie very well, did they? / []
12:11 It was a convenient place to stay…. Satisfaction guaranteeeeed / []
Just answer Yes or No! This man just cannot reply with a straightforward response! / []
I think it’s safe to say they’ll be an out of court settlement.  But can you imagine being a 60, 70 year old disgraced Royal, stripped of all his titles and duties. That would have to destroy your self worth an eventually spiral decline mentally an physically. / []
what are the details of the person who reminded him he was in Woking that day?  Was it in an official diary?  Or was it Dustin Hoffman from Rainman? / ['Daniel Billington Thanks for that Daniel!!', 'Daniel Billington No, I believe you.\nI think he probably was at Pizza Express picking up one of his daughters.\nI found it odd when he said someone reminded him he was there that day and then said "Oh I remember that".\nStill doesn\'t have much bearing on something hours later']
I think he forgot to mention they were shooting loads on that weekend... / []
I imagine after this, Andrew won't be using the analogy "it's a walk in the park" again  🤣 / []
Yep that’s a picture of me with the underage victim but no it couldn’t be me who did that because I can’t sweat sooooo not guilty. / []

Bill Clinton was on the airplane flight manifests 27 times when he went to Epstein's Rape Island. Bill and Hillary would like Andrew and Gislane to drop dead just like Jeffery. But even the Clintons don't have a big enough reach to get them. Eventually the truth will come out. / []
Pathetic!! / []
Omgoodness! This is growing up privileged. / []
The serious German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) refuses to publish my comments to this relvealing interview which I wrote in analogy to the Boris Johnson 'drinking' affaire Here is it: "There was a completely different affair in the UK with a completely different 'calibre', about which we (the newspapers in Germany)  prefer to remain silent, but thanks to the BBC and the UK media it reported it. The 'ruling class' finds it hard to bear when their wrongdoings are proclaimed to the public through the media, and for good reason. Not only the publication of inconveniences, but also the concealment of these gives a significant indication of the intention. The state-subsidized BBC, on the other hand, caused a stir a few years ago with a certain interview. But we haven't heard much about that in our subsidized TV. Here is the link for everyone who understands English and wants to know exactly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtBS8COhhhM / []
Here's a man who is so accustomed to the magnitude of his position and his aristocratic pedigree intimidating those around him into subservience and silence, that he is completely unaware of how ludicrous he appears in this interview. His arrogance is so painfully evident at certain points, yet he thinks he appears gallant and composed. Thankfully he's medically incapable of perspiration... / ["That's being a royal for you. They're so privileged in the upper classes that the family protects them whenever they do anything wrong. It breeds a special kind of arrogance though because Prince Andrew actually believed he could tell everyone off and assert his authority, which was a big mistake.", 'You\'ve heard the expression " He said - she said"  but this is " Royalty speaks - the commoner is silenced".\nHe calls his ex-wife " The Duchess". \nThe rich are different from you and me. Yeah they have more money.', "@leslieplayfair8272 Remember when Fergie was demonized for cheating on him and she said she felt unloved in their marriage? I wonder how much she knows...because this behaviour wasn't something that just happened. He's been doing this for a long time.", '@mish375 It must be why Fergie and Andrew are still together - she would accept anything Andrew does to have a free ride in life.', '@leslieplayfair8272 True. He probably gives her a regular sum of money to not talk as well.']
So he had sex with a 17 year old female. Since when is that a crime ? As ODD as it might be years ago it was quite normal for a man his age, and especially a royal. / ['A person under 18 cannot consent to a sexual relationship with an adult. He is a pedophile. There are probably other girls who were groomed and trafficked by Andrew and his freaky friend Jeffery.', '@rjohnson9543 they can consent over 17', 'The lawsuit was filed in the US where the age of consent is 18 year old. Andrew groomed, manipulated and cohersed Virginia into having sex. Legally it is same as any of the freaks on TCAP.', '@rjohnson9543 sounds like you should be locked up. Weirdo']
Absolutely hilarious reading the comments about how wonderful Emily Maitlis is.  Emily Maitlis is a horrible, rude, obnoxious, migrant loving leftie. Just look up her interview with the Hungarian Foreign Minister, she looks like she's going to pop a vein in the neck. / []
What really amazes me is how the "sweating" struck such a nerve...and to come up with such a vague and obviously  fabricated reason behind it...royalty still doesn't supersede self consciousness I guess. Generally I'm not a fan of seeing people's insecurities on display...but this dude is CLEARLY someone who's never had to take accountability. No degree necessary for me to believe his peculiar responses to and about Epstein are simply he was as sick as he was. But again, I'm just arm-chairing...at the very least, he is a hilariously bad liar. / []
He will never see jail. He’s royalty. / []
He seems to stutter allot now / []
The friendship with epstein was about money to begin with? Spiraled into what we know today. Giuffre is gonna get her day in court this interview went so badly for the prince?  the royal family must be really concerned about the potential for more revelations in the civil court  case. / []
I don't think we should judge him we  all done wrong in some Stage. / []
RULE BRITANNIA LOL / []
You are not delighted...and I say you are flat out lieing / []
How come the media don't talk about any other 'customers' of Jeffrey Epstein, many of whom are US politicians, CEOs of big business, and men of real power?  Shouldn't many of them be in police custody?  I think Andrew is being made the scapegoat, to take all the heat from the real perpetrators of the situation. / ["Go back over the case and you'll see why. This isn't a left or right issue either,  before you go down that road."]
Emily smiled. but she's intellectual. cracking job.xxxx / []
Your horizon is very wide, yet you chose to stick with a very small circle, not even to say, a bad circle.  Laugh and the world will laugh with you, cry and you cry alone. / []
He totally threw himself under the bus. / []
in future don’t do interviews it’s a recipe for disaster / []
what’s with the smirk on he’s face answering questions he’s clearly pissed off / []
It blows my mind to watch Andrew scramble his own mind to lie on the spot for everyone to see including his mother.  I am disgusted. / []
Absolutely no indication my ARSE / []
I see why Queen Elizabeth has a stiff upper lip! Shut up Andrew the lies are falling out! The nerve of him!! I'd love to see him being questioned on trail, talk about a train wreck / []
What a piece of trash … he really thought people would believe this shit. / []
He must have thought if he just did this interview everyone would just believe him and forget about it.  How arrogant and delusional. / ["Well he could in fact be telling the Truth, there is not much proof in she said he said to be fair is there! 1 Photograph, which could easily be the case of photoshop, I mean look how good these Photographers are at hiding the Famous' Skin Marks, Facial and Body Shapes, etc etc, easy to do if you know how! Medical Papers suggest he did not sweat at the time he Sexually Abused this Woman, who stated that he was Sweating huge Amounts during Sexual Activities, only time will tell when suppose, however we cannot assume he is Guilty when he could be Innocent!"]
Geez, this guy seems like a big liar / []
Ooop he don’t care about rape child / []
His judgment was clouded by his 'tendency to be too honorable'!?  12:44 Too honorable!? / []
He is liar I really hope he will go to jail and clean bathrooms / []
He care about his schedule 😂what about his bad he is pervert needs to go to jail to / []

I will not address Andrew as Prince since he has been stripped of most titles, but I am going to suggest this degenerate look up the definition of seppuku.   And bring back honour back to the Monarchy of the Commonwealth. / []
He went to break up. With His friend haha he's to honorable / []
Don’t worry, you will meet again!!!!!! / []
Dragged out really omg tell the truth Andrew / []
What country’s has he been too and done the same thing omg please let the truth come out / []
The stuttering while answering questions is hilarious 🤣 / []
Diana didn’t take her life either whoever hurts the royal family or tell the truth you gone 1000 percent omg  Harry protect your beautiful family xx / []
Like you who is always protected by your family  truth will always come out trust me Andrew don’t try too be convincing you have 1000000 percent failed / []
Why does Andrew have too think about the Answers and totally stutters omg please see through this / []
What a dirtbag punk, reminds me of Pence / []
It was a bit strange omg guilty right away tell the truth / []
Omg he looks like his father I think there is more too know about this family Diana told the truth like Harry did xx / []
CNN or FOX or whomever should Immediately hire Emily…. / []
All the hemming and hawing he does is a clear indication that he is prevaricating and being diffident about it. He deserves to be punished in every way. / []
Omg who is in his ear telling him what too say / []
He lies you can see this through the whole interview he is scared x / []
"Unbecoming? He's a sex offender." Yup. He's just a total piece of shit with a title. 💩 / []
Omg just tell the truth 🙏 / []
Interviewer was excellent. He was not. I do not believe him. He has no accountability. No honor. No shame for what went on. / []

A useless moron - he can’t even lie … / []
"I've never been upstairs so I don't know why the picture is of me upstairs" -then how do you know it was taken upstairs??? / []
First he says that he “really isn’t a close friend of Epstein and goes to great lengths to make the point that GM is the link. Epstein was her plus 1.  Then he goes in person to essentially “break up” with him. He felt it was the honorable thing to do. Why would someone care that much or go to such great effort for someone who really wasn’t a great friend. He is such a bad liar. / []
Andrew is clearly a major DOUCHE!!   What a dummy for thinking he'd be able to clear his name. I dont perspire.. what a DICK!! / []
Deep Thoughts... Shame on Andrew! Human sex trafficking is a crime. He is guilty by association with a well known, convicted  pedophile. Or maybe Andrew suffers from “false memories” and thinks that Epstein was not a convicted pedophile or that he can’t sweat?!!??!! Disgusting!   Thank you Virginia. Your voice will raise awareness & help prevent more people from becoming human trafficking victims.   Andrew should not have any titles including Prince, unless it is ‘Prince Charmin’.  What a disgrace! / []
13:42 😂 / []
Now you have to remember I have no recognition I cant remember hahahha how convenient 😅 / []
Ok, taking into account of what had happened in the past couple of weeks, - THIS DUDE REALLY THOUGHT HE COULD GET AWAY WITH THIS INTERVIEW??!!! WITH THIS ACT??? what the fuck Ever since then he got stripped off of all his honorary roles, he had to sell property to pay his lawyers, he has been rejected twice by the us judge, and these days royal servants come forward telling about his nasty things in the Palace...! Seems like he fucked Maxwell, too  and he has to face child rape trial in a us court.  I mean.... whats next???? WHOS next? / []
38:08 I wonder if the Royal Family had anything to do with knocking Epstein off? 🤔 He seems to know much more than he lets on. / []
Laudatory intro by himself, of himself and his duty and work. Quite sad really. If he is one of the ‘friends’ and the most public, let’s now hear from her who the ‘others’ were. A 22nd century crucifixion by himself .  The other feature of this is - where was her family? / []
Cant wait to see him in 24 hours in police custody. / ['😂👍🙏']

Ophra should watch and learn, this is how to conduct a proper interview, excellent work / ['Absolutely']
Watching this after the Maxwell trial, and this is just breathtaking. I’m speechless. To try and deny the photo evidence is beyond me. And the 4 day retreat to Jeffrey’s apartment in New York to break up with him? He’s from one of the wealthiest families in the world, a literal Monarch’s son, and is acting like he had to couch surf because there was nowhere else to stay. / ['He also keeps implying that Epstein made it possible for him to meet these academics and diplomats etc. as if Andrew would have any trouble connecting with these people on hisown. I\'d say the 3 funniest parts were:\n1. The "I was incapable of sweating" defense\n2. "Had to see him because I\'m just too honorable defense."\n3. The "it\'s a positive act" ramble.', 'Exactly. "it was a convenient place to stay". Yeah so are the hundreds of hotels in Manhattan.

OMG. Why did he even give this interview? lol. He might as well say "I'm guilty"... / ["Andrew's own _Waterloo_ ~", 'IIRC a lot of his PR people resigned immediately after this interview', 'The Duchess ( Fergie) thought it was a good idea.']
What a fantastic interview. For the interviewer... And for us... Not so much for the honourable gentleman on the right. / []
I keep watching this interview beacause it never fails to make me laugh.  He is an abysmal liar....Emily is quietly ferocious...let's him get away with nothing.   So funny to watch him squirm....almost feel sorry for the man. / ['Daniel Billington the women who interview’s him, Daniel.']
He is such a liar. Wow. Hard to get through. Watching in spurts over several days while doing housework... / []
Dude really walked out there thinking "damn, i nailed that". / []
He couldn't have had a foot massage because at the time he didn't have any feet / ['Lol', '🤣']
If he had gone a bit further than his current position; A complete sincere apology and offered to pay millions compensation/charity contribution with genuine compassion and sympathy for victims he, and the Monarchy, could have survived this. His life and rehabilitation after this is destroyed. / []

Interviewer: so Jeffrey Epstein is dead now  Andrew: 😃 yes   that photo was an insurance policy on Andrew. / ['Sure was']
The body language and movement proves that he's obviously trying to cover up his actions, making himself claim that he's "innocent". Throughout this interview he's lying so hard right now / []

Many innocent or guilty men have been judged with only 99% of the evidence. And then wrongfully convicted.

Prince Andrew said he knew Jeffery via Ghislaine Maxwell who was an old friend. Dec 2021, Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to abuse / []

Shame on you Andrew! Human trafficking is a crime. Maybe Prince Andrew suffers from “false memories” on whether he can sweat or not?!!??!!   Thank you Virginia. Your voice will raise awareness & help prevent more people from becoming human trafficking victims. / []

How did he know the photo was taken upstairs if he's never been up there?! / []
"I'm terribly sorry...but I, AS A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY, take very few photographs of public affection.." That statement seemed almost like a veiled threat of sorts.

Ghislane is even worse than Epstein. So him saying he was better friends with her doesn't help him. / []
I'm not friends with him but I use his houses & have to tell him we can't be friends anymore.  It wasn't me bcuz I don't sweat. I would think they would have coached him before the interview. This guy is an idiot. / []
Ship him to the state's. What a horrible man never an honourable. Its hard to call him a man. A spoilt brat all his life and a liar. / []
LOL "He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together".  He sure did! / ['Cannot believe he said that!']
We have a rule when the duchess is away I can play 🤣 / []
He describes he was unaware of "unpleasant " things that went on. Rape should not be described as "unpleasant ". / ['Or "unbecoming"']
It’s crazy how the narrative of this has changed due to giseline maxwells conviction. Andrews comments “I was there not because of Epstein I was there because of his girlfriend”. “I knew giseline very well but didn’t know Epstein so well”. Let’s see the monarchy do it’s magic and save this guy from a life sentence. / []
Wait so the geezer flew to see him to tell him they can't be seen together...  Sorry that doesn't correlate 😂😂😂 / []

Yes indeed his so so honorable... / []
" i never went upstairs in ghislaine's house 😂😂😂 / []
Nobody is guilty until proven. But I often think how this picture was made. I'm not saying that is not real but still strange to me. Prince Andrew welcome them in his flat. I don't think he asked about this girl age or ID. Maybe he assumed she is over 18. Secondly if he care about his reputation, would he really be so recless to go with them upstairs? What for? And then make picture with this girl. It's suspicious to me.  Maxwell staying apart almost like this picture was supposed to be taken only prince and the girl.  Maybe girl asked for a picture as a memory and Maxwell who seems very manipulative arrange all situation almost like she wanted to have something on him in the future. I don't think Andrew was thinking about making himself a pic. With a girl. It was rather the girl who wanted that picture or Maxwell who wanted to blackmail him.  Now another thought, why he would let himself in such a position?   The fact that he let make a picture of himself with underage girl point rather to .... that it was a normal situation. Girl wanted picture with the prince, because I don't believe prince wanted picture with the girl.  Why he went to speak with Epstein if he knew he was involved in child sex trafficking? A bit reckless. Maybe he was blackmailed? / []
The “Loyal” family kicked him to the curb. Wouldn’t want to risk any of that treasure trove from doing nothing all day…. / []
If i was Price Adrew farther id thow every vars at him in the palice as soon as he walk into the palce. Anyway he should not be aloud in the palice again. Theres young girls in their and children How many children as he raped how many girls as he had murden to shut tham up. If he does try to pay his victoms off that his guilt he should be sent to prison like the rest of the man that rape girls and children. To me it sound like we have another Jimmy Saville in the Royal Family here. He got to be guilty other wise he would not of lost what he lost. even his mother knows this. That house he stay at a peophile ring thats why he stayed there. He guilty end of / []
What incredibly poor judgement. I mean there is just really no other way to describe whoever thought this interview was a good idea. / []

Well the court of public opinion has spoken. SMH  I have nothing good to say about sexual predators. They suck and need to be permanently removed from society. All this video proves is that Andrew is a moron though. A big moron. Lots of high profile celebrities, politicians, etc had a personal or business relationship with creepy Epstein. Guilt by association doesn’t apply in court. He will live a life of public scrutiny. That is all that will happen to goofy Andrew. / []

His answers about the "photograph in question" are absurd, he looks up into the middle distance like he's plucking the line: "nobody can prove if that photograph is real or not" , out of a discussion he's had with his "advisors", like, you can picture his lawyer saying :"now, if she asks about the photograph, remember what we were talking about, now repeat with me, nobody can prove whether that photograph is real or not...,got it ?" You wouldn't answer the question like that, like it's a line that you have memorised, you would give it a preamble, lead your way into it...... 27:47..... The obvious discomfort he shows as he's about to blatantly lie : "I can absolutely, (closes eyes and hesitates) and categorically tell you (swallows) that it didn't happen" , the fear of being heard lying is making the lie obvious.... and he can see it happening, which in turn, makes his discomfort about  doing it, more obvious !! / ['Daniel Billington \nWhy is "being gay" a "thing" for you, it sounds like YOU have a "problem with it".....', 'Daniel Billington so....out of the blue, for no discernible reason you just decided to choose someone in YT comments forum to single out because you needed to see if you could "challenge" their acceptance of your self-declared sexual orientation, and that person automatically according to you has a problem with it !?!?\nNice try, fuck off, go and bemoan your inadequacies somewhere else, I couldn\'t give a flying f-ck what kind of genatalia you are fond of !!', 'Daniel Billington So... you assume that I am offended by your sexual orientation, you just decided that ?\nWhat "iffy statements", what, you just allude to my having made some "iffy statements", don\'t say what it is that made you decide I\'m (ahem) offended by your sexuality, "scratch" at me with some ludicrous accusation and sit there sulking, are you okay, don\'t fret, the World is a nice place to be, and more so that you are in it too Daniel, no , you are wrong I\'m not a phobic bigot, I live a productive and creative life, I am very comfortable in my own skin.

Lying through his teeth 🤥 / []
Emily Maitlis: How could you not recognize that the ten angers girls in his friend Jeffrey Epstains house was in fact, sex slaves? Andrew explains that he in his whole life been surrounded by maids. For the Prince this reasoning is absolutely logic. There is simple as that a difference between someone like himself , who have the same status as he has, and those who is there for serve you.  Andrew met E in the beginning of the -90s. They have been on a lot of dinners, parry’s and charity events together .   The Prince had both Epstein and his friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now convict for sex crime against children, as guests at his mothers castle in Norfolk.  They partying with Donald Trump in Florida and traveling on vacation to Thailand where they was photographed in the sunlights with naked women breasts.   Jeffrey Epstein was even guest to Andrews daughter at her 18-birthday on Windsor castle.   After Jeffrey Epstein was convicted for sex crime, his friends hurried to take distance to him.  Prince Andrew instead traveled over to USA for visit his friend. There was photos from December 2010 where Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew walked together in New York, that eventually led to that the Prince Andrew no longer could be in his role as a British  Handles ambassador.  In April 2015 the Prince name showed up in legals document’s in Florida related to Jeffrey Epstein.  A women with the name Virginia Giuffre claimed that that the Prince had sex with her when she was 17 years old: rapes that she states that was organized by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.  Buckingham Palace denied every accusation.  2019 Jeffrey Epstein was arrested again suspected for crime.  He was found dead in his cell in August the same year and the Media fuss did that Prince Andrew decided to talk it out in media.  It’s resulted interview with BBC has been written into the British TV-history.  The Prince say that the photographs that circled around with his arm around a 17 years old Virginia Giuffre had to be fake. He say that she had to be lien because she said that he was sweaty a lot and the Prince can’t sweat, it was some kind of damage he got under the Falkands war, he claimed.  But above all the Prince didn’t express any empathy to Jeffrey Epstains victims. Not even when the journalist Emily Maitles asked him if there was anymore he wanted to adding. Instead, the Prince said that he didn’t regret his friendship with Epstain- a man that lured in underage girls to powerful mans sexual pleasure for fun.   The Interview with BBC forced the Prince to leave the Royalty scene.   2021 Virginia Giuffre sued the Prince in a civil case in New York. In 22 January It was clear that the American court will not drop the legal process.  The Prince can now been put right in USA for sexual abuse.  The answer from Buckingham palace came immediately. The Prince looses his royalty titles, he is from now on a civilian citizen and as so he will defense himself.  He also looses all his military titles. Captain Tobias Ellwood , the President in the British parliament for defense Committee welcomed the decision.   It was “necessary for the British military reputation” he said. The war Prince is now alone.   And still claims that he has never met Virginia Giuffre. / []

Funny how he says he never went upstairs in that house where the photo was taken but he recognises it's upstairs. How does he know it was upstairs if he doesn't know what upstairs looks like. Also if he says that is him in the photo how come he can't explain what maxwell was doing there or the others.in saying it is him he also cannot deny maxwell or others were there .and in saying that he has few photos taken therefore he should remember better which photos he had taken. It doesn't make sense that he couldn't remember one out of a few yet many remember everything single photo they have had if even if there are many . also he has never accounted for the girls he was seen waving to from the door of epsteins mansion in new York especially as he claimed not to have met any of them or know them. Another thing is he says he visited these places when asked but doesn't explain the reasons for the visits. / []
He kicks himself “every day” for meeting Epstein but not having sex with a trafficked 17yr old. Quick to distance the Royal Family from the allegations until it suited him later on in the interview. / []
Andrew Prince of darkness. / []
I’m having a straightforward shooting weekend on the 22th of January - Are there anybody who would like to join in ….. / []
When this comes to court he will be eaten alive. Emily does a good job here but a laywer will have him for dinner. he contradicts himself so much. smugness does not cut it with a jury. what was a 40 year old man doing with his hand around a 17 year old? could not be him because he was never upstairs, yet he knew where the photo was taken. i hope she gets he day in court and her apology / []

what i found most compelling was. when asked if he remembered dining, dancing and having sex with  Virginia Roberts his response was " I don't recall having  ever met her". If truly innocent I would think that his response  would be more along the lines of " I've never had sex with ANY underage girl, ever|.... and I don't recall meeting this girl.' / []
How else should Roberts have known when Andrew was in NYC in April? She must have at least seen him there. / ['Maxwell probably arrange for Virginia to met up in new York with Andrew. She was the alleged  trafficker.']

If not so tragic, involving blatant lies, ruined lives, and hideous behavior, this would be highly entertaining, and I did have more than a few incredulous chuckles.  He was considered the "party prince" because he was one from the get go ("Randy Andy" lol).  I guess the days of Mummy protecting him and reining him in are over.  Took her long enough, but I guess trafficking and sex with minors wasn't an issue for her until the monarchy was at risk.  That it took about 15 yrs for her to take some action says volumes.  Time for that ridiculous, outdated, clueless, worthless monarchy to be done, along with the British peerage/class system. / []

Why should Prince Andrew be stripped of his Royal Titles and Uniform??  Did he open a brothel?  Did he habitually visit the under aged girls for Sex???

It was convenient place to stay to find girls ready to be forced into sex. I don’t even like stations at a friends’ houses when I go somewhere, not even if they have a nice place!

The best thing is if Virginia made you stop, afraid for meeting someone like her- that don’t care about money. She only care for that people like you don’t stand above the law.

Now he's trying to claim she has "false memories" while he has no recollection at all? / ['His trying everything.', 'Daniel Billington well Epstein was already a convicted sex offender for years then convicted of pimping girls and now his friend Maxwell too so yeah likely he has as have the cops that refused to investigate it for so long and now all say well that was ages ago get over it.

When Hugh and Divine Brown were caught in the act she was at least legal age and he was just an actor not royalty.', "Daniel Billington it's not about right or wrong it's about who makes the rules who enforces the rules what society accepts and celebrates etc.  Look at the Clintons too who incidently had Maxwell at Chelseas wedding too.  Clinton was applauded when he lied during impeachment because mistresses and prostitutes indicate how Macho a guy is?"]
He says he couldn't sweat at the time, but I'm betting he sure is sweating now. He keeps talking about how his friendship with Epstein was because he was Ghislaine Maxwells boyfriend (who was also just convicted of sex trafficking women) maybe he needs to keep better company. It's also strange that he felt the need to spend so much time ending a friendship if he wasn't a very close friend.. This whole interview just seems suspect, sure seems like he's lying. 🤥 🤥 🤥 / []

lol imagine thinking you could ever outsmart this woman in an interview / []
I’d  like to hear what he has to say about seeing the young girl to the door at Epstein’s mansion in Dec 2010.   It doesn’t match a breaking up with Epstein situation. Seemed like he was thanking her for something and in a very jovial mood.   The courage to stand up to the very rich is unprecedented and I commend the ones who have come forward. Many others have been shamed into silence but this time society has stood by them.  Progress. / []

Instead of saying I don't remember a photo being taken or that nobody can prove the photo to be authentic he would have said it is absolutely a fake picture because he would have remembered that since he represents the Royal Family and does not want a lot of compromising photos.

This is a masterclass in how to conduct an interview. Very controlled, non adversarial but very precise and cutting. Is she a prosecutor/lawyer? / ['I read that she is a star ⭐️ journalist.

Really, who are You trying to convince, Andrew? Yourself? Because you don’t convince anyone else. You don’t convince me. / []
He was carrying on with his life - yes - continuing to abuse girls. What a web of insidiousness. / []
He didn’t say we can’t be friends anymore - he just said I can’t be seen in public with you. That means if we meet in secret that’s ok. / ['Yes, and I saw a short film, when he was in Es house, waving to a girl, inside the house- looking around him that no one would see him. I guess that was fake to? Like he claim that the picture was fake? I pray to God he will be jailed. If there is a God, make it happen.']
That excessive blinking seems like a good tell. He seems to be lying. / []
Such a clown. / []
So stupid- I didn’t know that all that fancy education would result in such an idiot. He doesn’t even sound intelligent. He’s a bumbling fool. Can’t wait till the trial. / []
Pity the BBC never interviewed Jimmy Saville about his alleged crimes but then again they wouldn’t would they / []
It is just amazing how ill prepared he went into that interview. No show of compassion for the victims. He is invited to comment on other people's statements or evaluations. He is asked to participate in speculations. And he goes along with it for no good reason, apparently without any purpose or aim in mind. I would have liked the interviewer to ask if he had ever discussed E's criminal actions with Ghislaine Maxwell (who is after all described as a long time friend). And what exactly he was doing on the island. It may have produced interesting answers. / ['Creating business opportunities with under age girls. Joking aside, you know even if his lawyers could negotiate a settlement. The irreparable damage is already done.']
The interviewer should be ashamed of herself why talking about things that happened decades ago why didnt Viginia Giuffre not go to the court 5 years ago for instance / ['Hey- Andrew himself wanted this interview and he specifically wanted to talk about this.']
He wants watching or he will go the same way as epstine / []
This jnterview is similiar to the Stephanie Lazurus interview. The truth is so evident and damning that the only other option is to feign recollection, unfortunately that does not hold up in a court of law. His name dropping all the foundations he was part of is a deflection technique. / []
Besides of looking for guilty, don't you think that by having the best investigators org  in the world, could advise, whom in the hell your sons are getting along with? specially if you are the Queen of the most important (I don't mean reputable) monarchy, that it took you 20 years to find out who are your son`s friends, and now the best way is to abandon your son to the wolfs!, to save your what? / ['Monarchy of course. The Queen of England has sworn to protect it. And she has always put her duties first of everything. If that means she have to take her favorite son off all his 250 titles included the HRH title as a Prince, she’ll do it. People like Andrew (and Harry) just wants the glitter ✨- the money - but without duties. Very pathetic! But the people in England is the ones that paying them for everything. In return, they don’t wants royalties that making a fool out of them self.  They don’t wants their royalties bringing shame to the country. Is that really to much to ask!?']

I don’t buy it that he went to see Epstein after he was charged simply to tell him in person that he couldn’t be acquainted without him any longer. A more plausible reason would be that he needed to find out  he needed to find out what he should  or shouldn’t say to the police, to the media etc. Their stories would need to match up for him to escape charges. Too many inconsistencies in this interview and the way he addresses the female’s accusation towards him is chilling and clearly speaks of his guilt. Just my opinion. / ["Exactly! Also notice that he said that he told Epstein that they couldn't be seen together, not that he could no longer see Epstein. There's a difference.

A totally self-centred and stupid man. He cares no more for he lives of the victims and saw them as no more than the servants that have surrounded him all his life, ministering to his needs, upon whom he looks down on. / []
Because he’s such an honourable guy he felt like he had to go and honour a paedophile to tell him their friendship was over and stay there partying for a few days. 🤦🏻‍♂️ / []
Lairrrrrrrr / []
I have to watch again, it was a brilliant interview. / ['Same here']
The man formally known as "Prince"!!!! Stripped of everything, mummy's had enough, time he answered for all his creepy goings on, time he was made to leave Britain, he's disgraced his mother just after she lost her husband / []
I bet he was sweating all over the place in this interview 🤔😄🤭 / []
He tries to distance himself from Epstein by focusing on his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. Ghislaine Maxwell has now been convicted of sexual assault. He has not got a leg to stand on. / []
a prince of england shudnt spend all his time partying in usa  whats the point in the royals if they dont do thier job / []
He thinks he can fool the public with this comical interview. So arrogant. / []
His body language screams guilty! / []
My favourite line: “No, just a straightforward shooting weekend”.   Something I feel we can all relate to / ['Can you explain what a shooting weekend is?', '@cesarmalon7829 different answers depending if you are upper class or in Trainspotting', '@cesarmalon7829 ... People get together and shoot birds.', 'Underrated comment.', '😂😂']
he just hangs himself here from the first seconds...."we were friends because of 'other people'".. almost nothing he says in this entire hourlong interview is remotely believable. / []
Unknowing participant in a paedophile ring?, realisation of a situation brings out the best and worse in individuals with something to hide! / []
Emily Maitlis was superb. She just gave him the rope. He did the rest... / []
Okay. He starts his defense to the first line of questions by claiming to not be close friends with Epstein. Then the 2nd lot of questions (about him staying at Epstein's) depends entirely on him being such close BFFs that he had to meet this man (he wasn't that close with) to tell him gently and honorably man to man that they better not go out to play anymore. I pray every hidden thing this man has done be exposed. Sure he is foolish and this is a funny video but underneath you can see a disturbingly unsympathetic narcissist who has had unimaginable opportunities to do whatever he wants in life without having any consequence. This interview is an analysis and exposure not just of Andrew, but into the minds of the kings, queens and rulers of the world. / ["Lol. He's the queen's son.\n\nHe's not used to being put on the spot by a commoner.", 'if a revolution breaks out, i could see him wearing that expression of absurd confusion and denial while being dragged to the guillotine. just waiting for mommy to come and make the bad commoners leave him alone']
I don’t believe Virgina Andrews / []
"Considerable, considerable  stretch to say he was a close friend, i knew him through other people" - straight after saying Epstein used to say "go and stay in my houses when I'm away" , I don't know about you but I don't do that with acquaintances..... / []
I find it amusing that he downplays his friendship with Epstein by using his friendship with Maxwell as an excuse and look where she is now... / []
A ‘Royale’ liar. / []
A royale liar. / []
A interesting question I heard from tv reporter was: “does the Queen knows more about this and that’s why she took his hand off him in time? Now, she did ripped him off of everything when it was clear he can’t get away from the court. Now when he have to go to the states to the trial I guess things will appear. And maybe the Queen knows what that is that we all sone will. She make sure of that he don’t go there in the royals name, but as a private citizen. No matter what happens, the way back to the titles is closed for him. / ['Daniel Billington you’re still here, troll ? 🤦🏻\u200d♂️']
Now when he lost everything, he can as well come clean about what he did, at least. Take your punishment. Go to jail. Save your soul. Do the right thing. But that will of course never happen. He will continue lying. / []
"Well, I'm like everybody else..." as he's shaking his head "No, NO, NO, NO NO!". Little chuckle again about Epstein's "suicide"....similarly to Bill Gates, plus adding the oddly out of flow forensic anatomy detail, probably the hyoid bone...with a sort of deflection vibe...then another laugh when the reporter reiterates that Epstein is dead. / []
Andy boy… Trying so hard.  Saying People like me we don’t let us self get pictures, oh, no. No, in Andy boys world, the picture was fake. He don’t understand who’s arm it is holding the girl. “But you do recognize yourself on the picture?” Of course he did, but he never goes upstairs he has never been in that room, he never dress like that, but it’s he, yes, but how many photographers is it that taking this picture? You say it’s her camera? It is, you can tell because of what’s text upfront of the camera. Well he don’t remember anything anyway, so… / []
Seems to me that for a senior military man, he's incredibly unaware of his situation there. Also seems very clear that he's incredibly accustomed to being protected from consequences.  Weeks (cumulatively across years...), of being around Epstein and Maxwell and claiming to have never seen anything that looked like use of underage girls....boldface lying. / []
the foot massage bit lol..... such an idiot, one will enjoy jail food soon I think lol.... / []
This man is funny as hell 🤣 😂 💀 😆 falling all over his words.why didn't he take some classes to learn how lie with a straight face H&M need an apology from this evil family period / []
How very unbecoming Andrew?? / []
40:33 Andrew: Just act cool!  Interviewer: Epstein is dead...  Andrew: Haha yes! ........ Shit...... / []
He stutters when he’s lying… / []
oh the poor Andrew no more your Royal Highness . / []
The charisma and iq of a crayon / []
HAHAHA. wow, this was awesome. "I don't know who's hand that is" REALLY?!?!?! grow up, old man. / []
Lying azz he told on himself when he said "what i was doing i mean what he was doing" / []
I love to watch this interview before any job interview.   Reminds me I can’t mess up as good as this man. / ["Who would have imagined... that this guy's lies would actually contribute to people's personal growth?! Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but you certainly have a point!", 'Man? You’re calling this guy a man? He should be referred to as thing. He has all the evidence against him that he is a child abuser and predator. That’s not a man, Niko.', '@tastyburger9260 I support you, this is NOT a man, more of a lizard!', '@tastyburger9260 Relax, I know he is a predator, the point of my comment was to make people laugh. jeez...', 'remember this man never had to do any job interviews :)   that explains why maybe ?']
Total lack of situational awareness, if not weak emotional intelligence. For the monarchy, it waited far too long to take action; he should have been removed in 2011. And so the monarchy itself is in crisis / []
How many Um’s were there? / []
Seems quite the honest chap. / []
12:45 not this stupid humble brag 🤣🤣🤣 / []
Emily, you are beyond magnificent! / []
Nonse / []
8:54 you sound really dumb / []
I went to his house to tell him we should not be seen together? Lmao what? / ['And then I partied with him and had dinner.']
Traveling to NYC to break up a friendship with a convicted sex offender. BS! He likely wanted to know if Epstein intended to throw him under the bus. Problem with befriending depraved people, and joining underground social clubs is, you can’t outsmart them. They keep score, notes, evidence of every kind, and video.  Epstein likely hired the park photographer. Wouldn’t be surprise if Epstein was threatening him all along. He tried to get the case dropped on the grounds a settlement occurred! Why would you link yourself to a victim compensation settlement if it’s got nothing to do with you?  Trust me, Epstein didn’t pay anyone money. He got that money from his clients (the Johns). It was a sick game for Epstein and he enjoyed his role as a Pied Piper! I suspect the R-Family probed PA’s accounts and found something to close to home. No proof, just speculation. / []
I feel sorry for his daughters, Fergie and the queen. I do think Fergie knew….maybe why they divorced. / ['I don’t follow them closely but I’ve never seen any evidence to suggest she does or did', 'Daniel Billington I do know what you mean. Hopefully she isn’t.']
This is the best interview to have ever happened!😂😂 / []
Oh, the canned old Puke of York,  He played in Jeffrey’s pen. He knocked her up, first once, then twice, And defrocked her once again. And when he was up, he was up,  and now that he’s down, he’s down.  And when he could only halfway sweat, well, it never slowed him down! / []
He constantly looks Emily up and down with distain.  Learned Entitlement? / []
I will never understand why he did this interview.  But since he did, we all know he's guilty. / []
I want to be Emily when I grow up / []
My toddler lies better than this / []
And no one is concerned for underage children in the palace....🤨 / []
if you have ever confront people lying about something and you know they are lying, these are the vibes they give, its so obvious hes had this whole story planned in his head ready to defend against everything with his lies / ['The look the interviewer gives him at the end obviously unsettled him as she knows he is lieing through his teeth and is guilty as shit for sex crimes', "And he's a pathetic liar!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣", 'The average person can see the flaws in his account leave alone a lawyer.', 'Fr', "God if he had this whole story planned then he is dumber than a box of rocks. He came off like he hadn't taken a moment to think thru his answers"]
He should be locked up. / []
Don't forget that Prince Pedo is in a civil trial, not a criminal trial - altho there are crossovers, obviously.  The victim is trying to go for an indictment that will bankrupt the perpetrator for financial funds, much like the Simpson Family did in the OJ Simpson trial.  Took away his money. / ["\u200bDaniel Billington lol.   No, but I find a lot of delight that 'powerful,  entitled Nepotists', finally get grilled.  And, times have changed - it will cost him any funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, if there were any funds for him.  The interview is cringe-worthy.  He'll maintain money.  The Monarch probably has more money than the rest of the world combined.  He won't be moving next to me, because there's probably already one Pedo in the neighborhood already."]
Guilty for sure / []
His mother just stripped him, that means he's going to jail / ['Daniel Billington as an epstein sympthizer, maybe you should end up like him too?', 'Daniel Billington you’re a troll']
Beast / []
He & his team failed this… he should’ve admitted to sleeping with her, but denied that he knew anything bout their age. / ['Daniel Billington i think by lying, his reaction and responses were far more terrible and worse than they could ever be. Everybody knew he was tied to them, but by simply denying the age and admitting that he was partying there as a getaway was the best solution for his case', 'Daniel Billington thx bro 🙏🏻']
Housekeeper said you visited 4 times a year? 4 times a year!!!! In total i probably visited 4 times! This guy got it bad in this interview / []
Have a stretch Andy,,, / []
“I went to his house to tell him we can’t be seen together and left the next day “  Also “Prince” Andrew “ Yes I stayed there for a couple of days I was also doing several other things  It was a convenient place to stay”  This man is full of lies they all will burn in hell evil people / ['Daniel Billington sick individual yes']
The thing is with English people they are no good at lying, when your born here you will understand / ["fascinating statement , i lived there for 3 years , met and befriended many , but i've known so many from so many countries , i think truth or seeking truth , is an organic feature of any civilization , but yes the English did seem habituated to modesty and honesty", 'Daniel Billington troll !']
Strange idea that everyone including myself think Prince Andrew is guilty!  I could be wrong but this one video all by itself shows the world that he looks guilty when answering some of the questions asked!  Some of the answers to questions look pathetically stupid and makes one wonder, does he really think people throughout the world are stupid??  Yes, I think he really thinks that we are all stupid and he's never been more wrong in his lifetime!  🤣🤣 / ["He mistakenly believed that just because he's royalty that his word would be automatically taken at face value. His arrogance was and continues to be his downfall.", "Amber thinks we are stupid, Jussie thinks we are stupid so why wouldn't a privileged price not think we are stupid, all of them narcissists"]
“My tendency to be too honorable,”  what a wennie! 😂 / ['Honorably stupid 😂😂😂']
This interview shows why satire is dead. There is no way in hell you could do a skit on SNL and have it be any more bizarre, surreal and laughable than the real thing. He's never had to answer to anyone for anything in his life until now. And you don't need to be an expert in reading body language to see that every single word coming out of his mouth in this interview is complete bollocks. And now that the Queen has stripped him of all things royal, so that he will have to face the lawsuit as a private citizen, he is clearly royally screwed. / []
I Did Not Have Sexual Relations With That Woman, Miss Roberts! / []
Funny how when it’s convenient for Andrew, him and Epstein weren’t close, but when it came to the post-prison visit, he had to “show leadership” and “break the friendship” off in person. Why would you need to break off a “not so close” friendship in person with a convicted sex offender? / ['he lies']
We cannot know for sure by how someone looks or responds if they are guilty. Let's day they admit; they can be covering for someone else. That is why you need dna and evidence. Not words. / []
I still cant believe this is real, mind blowing every sentence, contradiction after contradiction, Lets see if his answers are the same under oath 💩…….with evidence 💩  its all gunna come crashing down,  he thought he was untouchable, what a job the interviewer done here 👏🏻 she dug the grave… he threw himself in, hope he never sees the light of day again / []
Sex case. Needs locking up an beaten up. But in UK for some reason all sex pests get off with it, wonder why? Judges? Don't trust any of them. / []
And here we are today Jan 2022 smh / []
He didn't  realise  the only thing in life is oxygen sex comes at a price and now he is paying the price and the consequences. / []
This is a horrible clueless amoral man. Sociopath. / []
Pause at 26:50 lol! He goes totally cross eyed! / []
Look at his eyes people they tell you he’s lying. / []
What a lier Andrew, but it's not all his fault these girls Know he was a prince and wanted fame or money / ['Absolutely disgusting. They were trafficked wtf is wrong with you']
The sweating bit...wow / []
Anyone fancy a pizza in Woking this weekend? / ['Daniel Billington Wonder what pizza he went for?!']
This is what happens when stupidity and arrogance clash at 1000mph head on.   Just watching it again a second time. My good god it’s still absolutely dumbfounding the stuff he comes out with. / ['I agree', 'As soon as this interview started he was digging his own grave. It’s like an avalanche of bullshit']
12:33 the vanity, arrogance, ego and narcissism here is absolutely extraordinary. Has anyone else noticed that his foot his moving involuntarily with his pulse? / []
How many have come here now that he has been stripped of his title? His family knows. He's sweating now, the lowly peasant that he is.😂 / []
And yet people paid more attention to Harry and his wife when this guy has always been the real disgrace of the family. It was about time he lost his military titles and his HRH. He is a man that obviously never thought he was ever going to be hold accountable for his actions. Someone who thought he was above law. Shame on all the establishment for shamelessly protect him for all this time. Finally, he faced some real consequences. Is he still receiving money from tax payers? Does mommy still pay for his security? / []
Apparently after the interview he went back to the queen and told her it went well 😂😂😂😂😂😂 if that boy had a brain he’d be dangerous. / []
dude is so guilty ,just saying / []
The journalist is amazing! He is so guilty! / []
A lier prince / []
Clearly he was playing a word game when he said all the people he saw at the one residence were staff, and then he speculates about looking back and wondering if he should have seen something.  He so clearly was party to it.   Staff. Just like pimps are bosses and sex trafficking victims are employees. The sad thing is, I'm sure he did consider them staff. The best lies are hidden in truth, but maybe he should have made sure his truth is relative/relatable to the people he was trying to lie to.   The fact that he can't even make it through the interview without incriminating himself between the lines is both a blessing and a pathetic testament to his political ability considering the position he has held his entire life. / []
his own advisors have such a sense of privilege as he does they sent him in for the slaughter, the days are hiding are over / []
How old is 17 really / []
Does he remember anything? Lol another Alec Baldwin , believes his own delusions / []
What was your reaction to his death "shock" the only solid answer he gave. And that's because he was prepped for it.  Mamma made a few phonecalls huh. Imagine putting her in a position of backing down on her refusal of trumps royal visit / []
This guy🥱 You could not spend time around him and not know what was happening. Impossible. He thinks everyone is stupid💁 / ['Of course but you know these people have degrees in lying although based on this interview, he might just be that stupid or they prepped him to look like a complete idiot either way Epstein was known to take pics of famous people with young girls to sabotage them so he got him with the photo']
PAEDOPHILE!!!! / []
Using his  legal  fiction / []
"it was a straight forward noncing weekend, I mean shooting weekend." / []
He should have watched this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE / []
Ha ha Ha the Prince is a laugh he would be good as Blakey on On the Buses........Butler! / []
I was going to be blah blah representative for international trade...so I thought I'd better learn something about that.    No privilege there 😑 so fkd up.  Fkd up like his fake confused face suiting of a teenager.  Maybe he's spent too long hanging out with kids / []
His deception seems well practiced. / []
It’s so obvious he’s lieing / []
If anyone thought he was innocent then I’m sure if they watch this interview they will see how guilty he is. What a complete and utter ignorant, entitled pr&*k. Nothing honourable about him at all. Let’s see how your trial goes. Great to hear he has been stripped of his medals and. HRH title. / ['He is not too honourable now ha!']
i watch this anytime i want to laugh / []
We’re not friends but I stayed in his houses , we’re not that close but made a party for his girlfriend! It’s like you just get invited within the royal houses fences being just casually acquainted! / []
A relevant legal maxim: Justice delayed is justice denied. / []
I can imagine the Queen being like “we are scheduling an operation to have your tongue and voice box removed” / []
I am not a Royalist by any stretch of the imagination, especially after Diana's death, and I don't know if he's innocent or guilty. Can we all remember that young man being knocked off his bike by a speeding American motorist coming out of a USA military place, of some kind? This killing by dangerous driving and driving away, all witnessed. No matter what the parents did to get the driver back to the UK, it was stopped by the big people in the USA, claiming Diplomatic immunity. The absolute evidence of the killing and driving away, to me is either Manslaughter or maybe Worse. These parents need to get this driver back here, to stand trial, on both charges. Ask this American Judge about this before he can force a British citizen to be taken to the USA, Surely this is a one-sided Law.  Colin, the UK. / []
How many months before Virginia's 18th birthday did this allegedly take place?  I think this is all nonsense and feel sorry for Andrew. So the fact that a few months differentiate her ability to behave in that manner that makes her accountable for her actions is resulting in this woman bringing shame to the royal family. If she was over the age of 16 in the UK, this wouldn't have received the same outrage. So for these reasons, I think it's all a big farce. / []
“I don’t remember that picture ever being taking in the way it’s been suspected” -“Why would people not believe that you was not with her that night?@ -I don’t remember I ever was going up upstairs”. I can absolutely tell you it never happened. @but she  says she had sex with you 3 times? And Andrew saying he was there and there ..so it couldn’t happened at all. - there is a witness saying you was staying in that house “ “no.” “Absolutely no to all of it” “why would you say no to this things?” “I’ve absolutely no idea.” (???) -Why would she lie? “I don’t remember meeting her at all. I don’t remember any picture being taking. And I’ve no sex with her” -Is there any way you could had sex with her or any other girl? “It’s very difficult forget positive action. But I can’t remember anything. “  Jesus Christ. The USAs lawyer’s will slaughter him. 🤭 I do think they won’t letting him get away with : “I don’t remember “. / []
Of course the girl who accusing him would never forget that he was Prince Andrew. But he don’t remember anything. / []
He remembers going to pizza express on a specific date 18 years later hahahhaha give me a break. / []
"Epstein was found dead..." "Yup!" / []
He shows no remorse. / []
He says “ I don’t think so “ a lot . Full of shit / ['Legal reasons most likely. If this was ever used in court then the I don’t think so doesn’t mean denial or acceptance. So it’s a grey zone answer. It’s the same as “I don’t recall”']
Wait…someone had an intimate dinner party of 7/8 close friend and you were one of them….but you wouldn’t  consider them a friend?! / []
Question:  so these teenage girls, were they living with Maxwell & Epstein or would they go home & come back???  🤔 / []
I’ve had cheating bf lie to my face that lied so badly I fell down laughing: this pathetic mommas boy makes them look like amateurs on the bad liars club / []
22:00 can we get a round of applause for this courageous vetern who regained his ability to sweat just in time to get roasted in this interview!? / ['To be fair, his statement was "I don\'t sweat UMM UMM UH ERR at least I didn\'t at that time", so nothing suspicious at all.']
He is an embarrassing to his country and to York. Being a royalty is like having a contract with the people. We paying you for being royalty. Giving you a lot of privilege And for that we expect that you don’t making a fool out of yourself! Bringing shame to the country. Is that to much to ask for?   Very well done of the Queen for taking him off his titles, (250 titles) even the Prince title- for a permanently time. Because of people like her, and example the Queen in Denmark (that is very popular) the monarchy can move on. I’m sure if Elizabeth 11 didn’t act against Andrew, maybe the UK revolution would break loose. Maybe we all longing after that now. / []
This has aged well Like 3 day expired milk left outside in July / []
I have never seen a better liar than he is. / []
I’d never seen the complete interview before.  Watching this on January 14th, 2022, it is indeed ironic that the interviewer finishes by thanking His Royal Highness, a title he now will never be allowed to use again.  His repeated claims to not recollect seem totally hollow.  The interviewer did a masterful job interviewing this “very honorable man”. / ['Indeed']
We can't be seen together  Goes for a walk together in the park / []
And incredibly enough who paid  for all of his trips and pedo activities ? He can thanks The British People… / []
He walked the plank. Teetered at the edge,then fell in the water. The 3 parts to this story. / []

It's clear to me that his royal Highness has been duped and taken advantage of , this bounder Epstein was a very unsavoury individual and poor prince Andrew ,, through no fault of his own ,, was dragged into his murky and sleazy lifestyle , ore power to the prince and iam sure he will be cleared on all these sleazy allegations ,.

The entire elite in this world is doing what he and Epstein did. ALL! They are there because this is normality for them. They rule, so, they are entitled to abuse. This is their culture. He is just unlucky . / ['Daniel Billington Boss, you have a problem!', 'Daniel Billington troll']
He had to personally visit Epstein to end their friendship? / []
Well he clearly did not deny it. But only claimed to not remember. / []

(The Queen Needs to Know)  That Powerful Judges are Corrupt and get away with Murder! Don't Destroy Boris  For 1 mistake. He has been humiliated, and suffered enough. Show compassion. I am crippled with a severe Spinal Injury since 1992. I was Invited to the Queens Garden Party in 2008. Then In 2010 my Wife abandoned me for a QC Judge - He was previously a Barrister for "beaten Wife's" S. O. QC She used him to have me falsely arrested for beating. For a higher Divorce settlement.  The Police was letting me go uncharged. - The Judge  Threatened the Police forcing my false arrest.  The Police said on the Interview tape that: SHE Never had a Mark On Her.! I have now found all the Evidence of PURGERY.! On Parlamentry Headed Documents. She worked for the Lord Chief Justice via SENDIST..,!

He felt as awkward as the public did listening to it.  Bet he wish he’d not bothered now, as that was pretty damming / []
He will get away with it all / []
Billy Liar .... 🤨🤨🤨🤨 / ['Daniel Billington troll']
came back to watch after he was stripped of his military titles/HRH status as of yesterday and while that's a great start for justice to be served ~ i couldn't even make it all the way thru. get this clown outta here already / []
I hate how every comment in a video uses the words heard in the video itself. People throwing royal words, like just talk like yourself. / []
I can smell the guilt through the phone… / []
THE MAN CLAIMS HE DIDN'T SWEAT AT THE TIME 🤣🤣🤣🤣  I wonder if anyone exists who truly believes he is rightful after watching this. / []
Prince Pedophile!!!!!! See you in hell with your buddy Bill Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein!!!! / ['Daniel Billington troll']
A straightforward shooting weekend / []
But HRH The Duchess of Sussex is the embarrassment of the Royal Family? I think not! / []
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, No, No, No, No. 🍼 / []
Has anyone here seen the: 'JSC - Criminal Psychology' video on this?  "Prince Andrew is not good at lying."  Look it up right now. / []
Not HRH , prince anymore … yay ! / []
Who is here  after queen stripped his military titles n royal patronage / []
He should be called Andrew from everybody around the world now / []
F hi got big file in him on quite / []
If he had not done this the same would of come out in end / []
Oh how he is "sweating" now lol / ['🤣💀💀💀']
i don't know where the trumb bar is,,oh and i never buy a drink when i was there,,,,lol how you not ordering nothing from a place you never been??that's beyond my brain,,,21:98-22:04 big cap / []
Whatever happens to this liar or the gold digger, YouTube is getting rich 😀 / []
He said he left the next day after he told epstein they can’t continue as friends anymore then mentioned he stayed at his place for the next few days and went to a party with him 😂 / []
And this man is his mother's favourite son. / ["Daniel Billington it's well known that Andrew is her favourite.", 'Daniel Billington troll']
He wriggled away from his friendship with Epstein. He states his friendship was really with Ghislaine. Oh dear. Fast forward from this interview to December 2021. Ghislaine is now also a convicted criminal and her appeal has been thrown out. 😮l. Whoops. What an  embarrassment to his family. His poor daughters! / []
I admire Emily. Very relaxed amd and not afraid / []
Im shocked the Palace doesn't vet all guest who gets invites. Their security and clandestine services seem a bit dated. ' They need a security overhaul tbh. And nobody came to break up the interview. Weird. / []
The lady interviewer is good / []
I'm surprised he didn't claim a medical condition that makes it impossible to dance in clubs or walk in the park. / ['Daniel Billington troll', "Daniel Billington Well, I guess you're sex offender.  Only sex offenders argue about age of consent", 'I guess he took off after being called out 😂']
I really don't think Emily gets the credit she deserves for this interview. So calm, to the point and allowing Andrew to speak which leads to more and more.  She should have a more prominent role with the BBC. / []
Andrew is totally unself aware.  He is a great example of the Dunning Kruger effect. He genuinely believes he’s smarter than everyone else / ['Classic narcissist', 'Even the little things this guy says come off as extremely obnoxious - like a "small" dinner party being "only" 8-10 people in his world.', "Well being raised as a royal will make him believe that as he's been catered to his whole life. But without his family protecting him, he's just as dumb as anyone else.", 'he and jodi arias', '💩🤡👿👺👽🙉😠😂😖💀💩🙀🤐🤥🤒🤢']
“And probably passing in the passage” 😂 / []
There is a lot of hoopla presently going on regarding Prince Andrew, and most people maybe watching this interview again.  In my opinion, Prince Andrew, is just a "victim" of  Epstein.  I don't really know what to call Epstein in English because  English is just my second language. But we have a word in our  language that aptly or fully describes a man like Epstein. That is why I understand Prince Andrew well in this interview. As for these ladies who resurfaced after so many years ...what were you doing at 17 years old with Epstein? Is a broken family or financial want enough of an excuse to be lured by him? / []
This isn’t just a car crash. It’s an M1 pile up involving 120 cars, vans, busses and trucks. Not only that but the emergency services also smashed into the crash. Everyone is dead. The carnage is still on fire as no one wants to go near it and the motorway has been closed ever since. / ['Everyone involved is dead apart from Emily Maitlis, the journalist who broke the story.']
Bet he's sweating now! / ["There's 0 drs records to show this condition", '😂😂😂']
At last  This filthy shit has had it coming ,liar.You have caused damage to the Queen. She's done the right thing.Go get a real job like Pizza Express, you Perv / ["Just insane isn't it. I stil can't believe this is real", "@jamesulbot It's real alright ,British society has had enough of him ,he's an arrogant shit His own mother had enough. The Queen has always behaved impeccably  ,he has brought shame on  the family God save our Queen!!!!!!", '😂😂😂', "@peanuts4434 what's your  problem?", 'Like my brother, wrote the book on narcissistic behaviour, married his own reflection. This man is no good.']
A man who has never been challenged at all, ever during his entire life is suddenly challenged....and he hasn't a clue how to handle it! So he lies like a 10-year-old. Its hilarious to watch him dig his own grave in this style. Being accountable for our sins is the hardest thing we ever have to do! / []
The problem here isn’t “white privilege” or “#metoo” infractions, any of the other compartmentalized movements being pushed at us.   It’s the overwhelming abuse of power.   That black book had everyone from the woman in charge of the Nickelodeon network, and her husband, to the Clintons, Trump, and Obama, just to name a tiny fraction of the powerful names it contained.   The problem here isn’t a person’s race, gender, religious credo, or political affiliation. It’s the abuse of power by the individuals put into places where we trust they will do what’s right and honourable.   It’s really our failing, our compliance  as a nation, that’s to blame here, with all this needless infighting amongst ourselves that distracts from the real issues at play here and allows this horror show to intensify with every year that passes.  People in places of power using ALL of their manufactured confusion to distract us as a nation, which allows them to continue their corruption unabated.  Until we understand that we need to focus our energy into reigning in these powerful criminals together, as a nation united, instead of squabbling amongst ourselves, these power-crimes will continue to grow in ferocity and metastasize, completely eroding what’s left of our already terminally ill  society. / []
Face the music Andy. / []
So he would remember going for pizza because it was 'wierd', but he'd remember raping a minor, sorry, sex with a woman, because it would be 'positive'? Can he even imagine what the victims feel when they hear that kind of statement? It sheds a lot of light on who the man is. / []
Andrew lost his H.R.H. title last night. Watched this again just to remind me what an absolute piece of dogsh1t this person really is. A disgrace to the entire U.K. / ["It's insane this is even real"]
This guy is guilty as sin, but he’s small fry. Charge him quickly so his victims can get some modicum of Justice for the horrors they had to endure at his hands so many years ago. They’ve suffered a long enough wait for this to be exposed.  But, I say pry that black book open and drag EVERY man and woman out that was involved in those “Lolita Express” flights.  The guilty prince is clearly being used as a smoke screen in an effort to shield the MANY other powerful monsters that participated in the depravity and debauchery orchestrated by Epstein. / []
If any indians watching this : This interview has uncanny resemblence with Arnab goswamis interview of Rahul Gandhi. LOL. Mr. Andrew be a man, accept the misdoings.No one is above law now and Law has long hands. Ur balls are bound to be get grabbed sooner or later. Utter shamefull for Royal family specially the Queen. God bless the old lady and late prince philip. / []
The media LOVE this story. She was 17 and now she’s after money. More important things like actual rape & pediophobia by UK grooming gangs is swept under the carpet. Wives & girls that are shocked by this, do me a favor and go through your partners internet history without telling them. Good luck 👍 / []
the photo was taken upstairs and I never went upstairs how would he know what the upstairs look like if he never went upstairs 27:10 / []
"Unbecoming behavior." Excuse me - he was a sex offender. / []
48:01 / []
Bad luck Andrew your on your own / []
“Oh..oh.. certainly i never felt the need to party”.  Ok dude. His obvious lying is beyond cringe. Pathetic / []
At the sex parties, there was simply the most incredible range of people……it was so stimulating…. / []

Now look I'm a bit narky on this. This woman girl hooker whatever you would call her done a job she was given and paid well I would say. Now the strange thing here is was it a one as it seems the only one she is interested in charging is Andrew. Tell me there were no others otherwise what's the deal / []
I know notting 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💩💩💩💩💩💩💩😡😡😡😡 / []
He thought the interview wet well!  How utterly stupid is he?  Does wealth and priveledge cause brain damage? Interviewer is brilliant! Andy must go to jail and learn about abuse! / []
Lying through his crooked teeth / ['Don Bond An Honest and Honorable man, our prince is just too Honorable']
Positively ,categorically, utterly, absolutely no. No to everything.lol / []
His forte sure isn't lying. / []
"He didn't go into detail about what I was doing.. eh what HE was doing"😳 😂😂 Freudian slip there randy andy 🤣 / []
🙄🙄🙄😳😳😳🙄🙄🙄 Pinocchio's nose is growing during this interview.🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 / []
There is no question in anyone's mind here about his imperialistic sadistic state bnb of mind. He absolutely did indulge himself into  gross sexual misconduct on a criminal level with an imperialistic arrogance. Send him to prison where he belonged long ago! / []
Never trust a person who first talks with their hands... / []
“I flew to his house to tell him we can’t be seen together”  Makes perfect sense / ["HA HA HA - now, that's funny.", "His deceptions are blatantly obvious. His story is far from convincing. He  is clearly lying. He stated that the photo was obviously taken  upstairs  as he knew what upstairs looked like, then later her states he doesn't know what it looks like up stairs.

He will be easy to reveal.", "@barroonsyska467 he's a cross examiner's wet dream.", 'The interview that just keeps giving ,30 years in jail any normal person would be jailed but this crap is still walking free when will justice be got for those young girls', 'Right… the duke of studder']
JCS needs to do a video on this, it might as well be his criminal interrogation. lol / []
If Epstein was not his “close friend”, then why did he have to cross an ocean and personally tell him they aren’t friends, then spend 7 days with him after being formally convicted of sex trafficking.  And he claims Epstein allowed him more access to international figures than the Queen or being an HRH?!? Seriously? / []
The prince is NOT a good liar. / []
It take one too know one / []
Glad he lost his HRH / []
It was a convenient place to stay....you can stay at a hotel, you are a prince for f**s sake! / []

And that's where it ends from the words esptine. This man knows now it's  lies / []
This interview has aged like milk. / []
Here we go!!!! / ['He is sure shitty at deflection']
28:00 repeat this for 10 seconds and repeat at least 3 times, and look at his face. Make your own mind up. / []
Liar Liar Pants On Fire. Welcome to the American court system pal. You're going to love it. / []
I feel like he is overcompensating, the sweat thing is just plain silly. It’s a biological reaction he would be dead if he didn’t sweat, that’s how the body regulates your internal homeostatic temperature. It’s not something a person can survive for long / ['There are actually people who can‘t sweat, my maths teacher was one of them. They have to be careful to stay hydrated, but it is possible to live a relatively normal life.']
You know the Queen was watching this going “FFS Andrew!! Just stop talking!!” / []
Oh dear. Two years later, it's even better. / []
13:40 oof moment self note since JCS edited his video >_> / []
um um um um um um um / []
Sweat is the real MVP in his fairytale story. / []
He will be sweating soon!  LOL! / []
....man you are lying... just stay quiet.... / []
"The date that is suggested, I was at home 'with the children' - can this creep bve any viler? Using his kids as a cover?" Pig. / []
Err.....even though Prince Andrews claims he does NOT drink, he seems to have been partaking excessively of the lie-bations here!! ...........jest sayin' / ["The change of tone in his voice when he gets cornered by the interviewer's way of questioning is a clear give away."]
"That photo was taken upstairs, but I've never been upstairs." If he's never been upstairs, how does he know that's upstairs? / []
The composure of the interviewer and her tolerance to finish an interview with a liar.  I would not have lasted for even 2  minutes if I was her. I would have definitely walked away from this interview. / ['Towards the end she even seemed legitimately shocked and disgusted by what she was hearing, being a rapist and sex trafficker is apparently "unbecoming" and the prince expresses no remorse for the victims of truly awful crimes, he didn\'t even pretend to care for these women.', 'She did a great job by not walking away. We needed this interview done. However I agree, I might not have had the strength to do what she did.', 'It’s her job, for God’s sake!', '@GradKat you have a problem with people praising someone for being good at her job?', 'Imagine what a good litigator would do with him.']

If my best friend was found guilty of a sex crime, no matter how 'classy' I am, you best believe a face-to-face meeting wouldn't be warranted, nor would I stay at at their place afterwards. Great interview, glad he's been stripped of all prior recognitions. If this dude is being hung, it's the start of something beautiful. F@#$ their status and wealth, treat them like anyone without power. / ['Not only a face to face break up but practically a vacation! This man has all the money in the world and is acting like he was couch surfing', '@kathy-bates0  not being weird or anything but I just had to say you are so pretty']
Extraordinary people? I’m sorry sir but the people you speak of are certainly not extraordinary people in my eyes. Sick , disgusting, mental, may be words I would use to describe the lowest of the lowest people alive. Sir I’m sorry to say this but you sir are a disgusting person. / []
oh boy he's so toasted! terrible terrible liar. So bad he seems delusional / []
Andy, you could have at least smoked a joint first! SHWEEEETT!!! / []
🥶🥶🥶 / []
He lies so much, it makes me ache. It's a painful interview to watch. So blinking sad / []
He said he had to honour a human trafficker. / []
Today he got his HRH title taken away. Wow. What a punishment. He needs to see a jail cell. / []
This prince(???) Is a crook And a joke!!!!!!!!! / []

Guilty as fuck!!  Your finished Andrew 😡🤬😡 / []
Lots of squirming, sidestepping and lying. Another rich, entitled and evil person who hides behind the wall of privilege to get whatever he wants. This guy deserves some serious jail time. Perhaps more. This interview was a disaster for this guy but hopefully justice for the victims. / []
Oh my, the absolute lies. Why can this happen. / []
Prince Andrew loses military roles and use of HRH title    13-01-2022 / []
He would been better off saying that Epstein was a charming character, they became friends so he stood by his friends side, threw him parties and went to stay with him as he thought a supportive friend should. Being in the Royal family , growing up sheltered and protected made him an innocent man and gullible man. However, never did he partake in his activities, never did he know what Epstein was doing. He wasn't ever involved in anyway etc etc. Play the victim, and not the person denying of every wrong dooing. / []
Liar liar pants on fire / []
I love how he can't even use his girlfriend as an excuse for being tied up with Epstein. She's going to jail too ma boi! / []
I can you not know if you have been invited to a dinner party being given in your honour? Lie after lie after lie. Get a back bone and own up to your mistakes. Pathetic. / []
'You were staying at the place of a convicted sex offender?'  Prince Andrew "It was a convenient place to stay"  ahahahahahahahaha / []
As funny as this is my man R Kelly still takes the crown imho 🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Come and use my house 🙃 for what? Can't you get your own place? Has the ability to bring extraordinary people together.. Pedos? / []
When the night that him and Virginia were at that club dancing and drinking together and he raped her came into question he said he'd never been to the club and has no idea where it is and then a minute or so later he says "I never bought drinks or drank drinks from that club when I was there" he doesn't even remember the lies he tells / []
he has lost all his powers now. / []
I think it is a false claim from a person who is trying to cash in on Prince Andrew. The facts do not add up from the claims of this so-called innocent girl. How did she end up in the hands of Epstein? / []
Revisiting this video right after he lost his royal patronages. Hopefully some jail time is next / []
GOTEEEEEM / []
Good... trump should be next. / []
She is great!… and the truth is on is face and gestures! / []
I’m here for the comments 👍 Also an amazing interview to see a man lying for the entire interview. Good case study. / []
Comes across as a decent honourable man / ['i love your sarcasm', '@TheOnlyIncognito not at all.']
Not right that Ghislaine Maxwell is the only one being held accountable.  Why were the records sealed. / []
Wow. / []
Don't get involved with Mossad agents / []
Who else reckons he’s sweating right now  🙋‍♀️ “Remember that it was Epsteins girlfriend who was the key element in this “ Oh Andrew .  #andydidntkillhimself / []
This is gold. I’m going to revisit this when I need a laugh. Great interviewer, bad liar. / ['Same!! That’s why I’m here😄😎✌️']
Who remembers Koo Stark and THAT andrew scandal? liar liar andrewstick / []
He was really nice-looking as a young man. He’s really become dissipated looking!  He talked himself into a very large hole. Interesting that he keeps switching between “I and we.”  Lots of “uh”, “er” “um.” / []
"Epstein´s house was the convenient place to stay". Like he can´t pay for a hotel. No security videos from Trump´s bar or his house to confirm either story? This guy is sounding more and more like Stephanie Lazarus: Andrew: is it possible that you had sex with a minor in any of the Epstein homes? Gosh, gee, it´s been like a million years. I don´t remember / []
Bull Shit / []
Who is back? / []
He is just disgusting.  He has daughters himself. / []
Penipu punya orang. / []
Liar! Liar! Pants on fire! / []
he will have no choice soon but to blow his brains out / []
It's very very sad that not once does he mention the victims, he really believes that he is above everything! I'm terribly sorry your majesty but you're as guilty as hell and need to do the honourable thing and tell the truth! / []
This is my 3rd time watching this whole interview... I only saw Titanic once. 🤷‍♀ / []
Guilty / []
This dude for realz? My girls ex boy shot at me 3 months ago and I be sweating everyday since. / []
How could he possibly know that picture is taken upstairs if he’s never been upstairs? So how would he know what upstairs looked like 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Now get EVERYBODY CONNECTED TO THIS PIECE OF SHIT! / []
Who’s here after the ghislaine trial where the royal family stripped Andrew of all his royalties 😂 / []
The civil law suit guilty verdict will only take 50 minutes. / []
He's guilty not a good liar / []
Anybody that abuses anyone that’s vulnerable or against their own will is a scum of the earth doesn’t matter who they are! He deserves to have no nuts left. Ohh 😮 his many excuses, he must have had a very sheltered life experience. Only coming out of the navy etc. so he was never in a sexual relationship with his ex’s or ex- wife, present living partner. He’s a man not a baby lol. He probably ? Or also was making a living out of the sex trafficking. Why was Ferguson getting money off JE. PA was living well over his means in money 💰 from his naval job and RF allowances from household expenses. / []
Feeling kinda blah today so I decided to at long last watch this interview, nothing like watching one of the privileged in the middle of a blood bath to lift one's spirits. My car may be broken beyond repair but my day is still not as bad as this creep's day. / []
So well said.  And it’s also Australia, NZ, Italy, and a very long list of countries.  Now put me on a fuxxxing flight to Nashville!! / []
it’s kinda pathetic how everytime he’s pushed into a corner or caught out he tries to subtly remind her (and maybe the audience) that he’s a member of the royal family. it says a lot about not only his level of arrogance but the amount of power he derives from that title. / ['Where?', 'Where did he do that ?']
Were is Piers Margan comment on this? Or is it just women he comment on! He was so quick to say he thinks Megan was lying 🤥 🙄 what would he say in this interview 🤔 Nothing I guest. / []
Like your work Emily, he has got absolutely categorically no shame!! / []
"Coloured by my tendancy to be too honourable" LOL, Holy mackrell.....what a line... Lock him up!!! / []
Revisiting this on the day the Queen strips him of all his titles. / ['Same 😂', "...and the day he reaches a 'settlement'"]
Guilty / []
We wonder the same things,  this lady was never hurt... / []
He still doesn't regret?  Ha Ha Andy / []
i feel sorry for every human being who had or has to be put through and endure the suffering of being sexually used, abused, trafficked, enslaved and so on. I wish I could see some sympathy by him in this interview. / ['Andrew has probably never been held accountable for ANYTHING in his entire life ~ this interview is proof that what goes around eventually comes around!', 'Karma is true', 'The only thing he’s sorry about is wishing he’d never done this interview. He was arrogant and narcissistic enough to think the interviewer would believe his bullshit.', 'What this interview was bursting with sympathy but unfortunately only for himself.']
Leave him alone / []
LuLz good luck in civil court your peedo "highness"…… / []
Great !! An legal age woman who went back time and time again needs to hold  a man accountable!! Yes hold them accountable to the services you provide !! … Can we also hold Anne Sacoolas accountable to the DEATH of Harry Dunn !! Nobody is above anybody else !! They all should be held accountable / []
He does not remember photo? Rpalyass don't allow such dumb images / []
Man said he stayed at a pedo’s mansion because he was too honourable lmaoooooooo / []
And that is right..it's impossible for me to sweat 😓 / []
I must say that he is not on guilt ! And he has a the dirt in the 🌎 world recorded ! / []
His defense is in the clear! / []
I like prince andrew he served in the Falklands man and he's innocent until guilty surely but it seems youtube has made its mind up already / []
Intilececullay it was fun! / []
Due to your honesty Sir you will be Spard! / []
Randy Andy!! / []
At the end of the day. In the day of true royal life... 17 was a old maid... true story... sorry to say... just let it 🚶‍♂️ go / []
I admired him a short while in his recognizing it was not all ' normal ' there... on the 🏝 island ❤  you can go down in history! It's not 2 late!  Not to cut short..a brilliant interview 👏 / []
I cannot help but wonder how many hours prior to this interview Prince Andrew stood in a Buckingham Palace bathroom, staring into the mirror, practicing his "Who, me?" face. Cause it shows up a lot. / []
His profuse blinking…. Indicative of fib telling? / []
I admire him when he said he is on a different statice then most people on that island 🏝 😳  it was all to be a  paradise for singles men and women! It was to be fun! No regrets for anyone ! What happened 😕? / []
PR team for Andrew had a 'mare here. / []
six ladles on a private island,  OMG man ! What real man would not dream of that?  When she said four times a year he was thinking more like 20'? Or more... / []
Prince Andrew stripped of military titles! Do you recall, HE IS DONE? A MUST-WATCH VIDEO! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkUByhMw9Po&t=413s / []
But since he is extremely rich and driving a Austin Martin  James Bond specially made for him and also had a Range Rover  1967 stashed in the backyard 😀   when I was 14 I was kissing 💋  girls my age! No harm right? / []
I know I go stay with people four times a year in other countries at one of their four homes, even though I don’t even consider them friends. / []
We all know Ghislaine Maxwell as a bit of a wild child if you followed the news from the UK. She was her father's favorite and he was extremely rich and controversial. Prince Andrew was a mummie's boy and the Queen's favorite but this didn't stop him to have an affaire with Koo Stark, a pornstar and there was no love lost between Fergie and the Royals. So both were frequently mentioned in the tabloids and the BBC news. So nothing new there. But I do believe she was so in love with that Epstein character. So much so, she would have done anything to not get dumped by him. It's also no secret he gas- lighted her early into their relationship. That whole family is all about secrets and saving face. As are the Royals. I think the three of them just used eachother to their own benefit and closed their eyes to the more sordid details that were not known to the public. Is Prince Andrew a pedophile? I don't think so but did he like having young girls around to have sexual relationships with without other strings attached? While he was introduced to the rich and famous. Sure 100%...mixing business whith pleasure is right up his alley. Did laugh with the remark...they couldn't be seen together instead of I don't want to stay friends with a person like you!!! That says it all. / []
He bathers on and on without saying anything. And his inappropriate laughs? "Eipstein is dead." "Ho ho!"  "We need to end" HAHAHAHAHA!!!  What’s his problem? I thought they taught royalty how to act.  Cringyyyy 😬 / []
The Man has absolutely no Guilt for real? But doesn't realize his mistakes 🤔,  it's very sad, it's because he has been in titled,  he just cannot gage a responsibility?  He doesn't deny sex  associations ? / []
We shall give him this ! Very nice shoe 👞 shine to go with the lies!*  at the end of the day * very convenient?  OK Allright,  just forget the perverted parts' please?   Yes I know the band Fragma is the best 👌 / []
She is brilliant,  staff gave him afew drinks and he sang like a pigon ^*!   Is he so nieve?  He may be so lucky to keep his privates! I certainly don't mean that  but in the 1600s? And yes she can spot a lie^*! At once!^* / []
It’s ok. Your day will come….. Father God knows the truth. Let the whole truth be exposed! / []
Well I think he’s definitely guilty it shows in the interview / []
The interviewer had her homework thoroughly done ✅ What a star!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 / []
Emily Maitlis: Do you remember meeting [the 17-year-old Virginia Roberts] at all?  Prince Andrew: No.  Emily Maitlis: Do you know you didn't meet her, or do you just not remember?  Prince Andrew: No, I have, I don't know if I've met her. But no, I have no recollection of meeting her.  Emily Maitlis: Because she was very specific. She described the dance that you had together in Tramp's, she described meeting you, she was a 17-year-old girl meeting a senior member of the royal family.  Prince Andrew: Never happened.  Emily Maitlis: She provided a photo of the two of you together.  Prince Andrew: Yes.  Emily Maitlis: Your arm was around her waist.  Prince Andrew: Yes.  Emily Maitlis: You've seen the photo.  Prince Andrew: I've seen the photograph, yes,  Emily Maitlis: How do you explain that?  Prince Andrew: I can't, but I don't, I mean again, I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken.  Emily Maitlis: Do you recognize yourself in the photo?  Prince Andrew: Oh, yeah, it's pretty difficult not to recognize yourself.  Emily Maitlis: Your friends suggested that the photo is fake.  Prince Andrew: I think it's, from the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not, because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph, so it's very difficult to be able to prove it. But I don't remember that photograph ever being taken.  Emily Maitlis: But it's possible that it was you with your arm around her waist?  Prince Andrew: That's me, but whether that's my hand or whether that's the position, I...[shakes head]...I have simply no recollection of a photograph ever being taken.  Emily Maitlis: The world has now seen the photo that Virginia Roberts provided, taken by Epstein we understand, in Ghislaine Maxwell's house.  Prince Andrew: Here's the problem: I've never seen Epstein with a camera in my life.  Emily Maitlis: I think it was Virginia Roberts' camera. She said a little Kodak one that she lent to Epstein who took a photo, and your arm is round her waist.  Prince Andrew: I don't remember that photograph ever being taken. I don't remember going upstairs in the house, because that photograph was taken upstairs.  Read that last line again. / ["I just thought that myself. If you'd never been up there, you wouldn't know what it looked like to know it was taken upstairs!"]
He let humanity down by proving he’s just another monster. Thanks to the pretentious monarchy by protecting their entitled children. Off with their heads! / []
have you ever heard such a lier in your life haha / []
LIAR / []
If you've never been upstairs,  how do you know the picture was taken upstairs? 🤔 Boy, bye! / []
... "my tendency to be too honorable..." 🤭😅🤣🙈🙉🙊 / []
If he's too honourable ... Like he said ..that he had to go to New York to break off his friendship with Epstein ...I wonder whether he is still honourable enough to go to New York to defend himself against some thing he said never happened .... / []
Wonder why he never allowed his own children to follow uncle Epstein to his pedo playground? / []
His body language... / []
with maxwell conviction this interview just gets worse 🤣 / []
I think Biden just met his match as far As political leaders "not remembering" / []
Unbelievable liar on every account! If your going to lie at least try and be convincing! / []

As a naval officer, he was a good one. I never served with him, but my older brother did in the South Atlantic in 82. Whatever he did or didn't do elsewhere with whoever else, he was as good and brave as the rest of them when under fire. And they came under fire. I'm not saying it excuses anything, just that this is all I know about Andrew. / ['lol']
1000000% ongeloofwaardig .  hij is schuldig . hij moet gewoon zitten op zijn blaren  15jaar gevangenisstraf  zou gepast zijn .  paar miljoen dollar word er betaald soort schikking. en ze zien de gevangenismuren niet van binnen . dat is het kromme van hele rechtsysteem.  dit is letterlijk misbruik denken ze door hun hoge rang in orde mij maken ze toch niks.  onthou 1 ding  hier moet maar 1 straf voor zijn  flinke gevangenisstraf  boeten voor zijn daden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
a straight forward hunting weekend my arse. These elites do not and, to be fair can not understand how working people exist. We are disposable units to these folks  who they are unable to empathise with...paying gas bills, council tax bills, car tax, petrol costs. They have no clue. Go to A and E it takes me and you hours to get assistance and years to get surgery, HRH has no understanding of these issues. HRH will hopefully get a straight foward trial. / []
So… his defense is “I didn’t sweat at that time”. Smooth. / []

I don't even think he realised he'd had his pants pulled down and shown to be a complete bullshitter, in front of the world audience until much later on. After the interview he even gave her a tour of the palace! His arrogance will be his downfall. / []
My 3yr olds a much better liar! So obvious he's lying threw his teeth.. A body language expert could tear him apart.. Total bull.. / []
Conversation in the park.. Andrew.. I couldn't tell you on the phone coz it's being bugged wot wot wot but there on to us..  Epstein.. Don't worry, your a Prince an I'm a billionaire.. We're home free.. Rich people are stupid. / []
I'm amazed at how big you can dig a hole with your mouth, well done Andrew, you dirty old git.. / []
“Actually, that’s impossible. Because I don’t drink. I don’t mean to be ‘grand’. But as a Royal, I have all my essential liquids intravenously administered. Except for my debauched nights at Pizza Express. As it were.” / []

Uh-Oh, SpaghettiOs! 🤣 / []

Boris Johnson has been using this interview for tips/training, to explain his party that wasn't a party. / []
This guy is the worst liar!! / []
Giving him the benefit of the doubt assuming he was eating pizza in Woking in the afternoon/evening he could quite easily be in Tramps night club later that night it's only 30 miles away. / []

Just. a Straight Foward shooting weekend🤡 / []
This has not aged well. It keeps getting worse and worse. His defence is he was friends with Maxwell but she's been found guilty now as well. The circle is closing around him. / []
Soon as that photo come out of him.... boom his arse went. 🤣  i dont drink mind haha / []
You’re guilty as hell, good luck in USA court hearing 2022 / []
Lying has the tendency to put the body under huge stress and this can result in a dry mouth. That's why liars usually lick their lips often whilst lying 🤥 / ['maybe, but I‘d say it‘s a normal thing during an hour interview, an hour of talking, that ones mouth tends to get dry. \nneverthelessI believe there are a lot of lies in this interview.']
My 7 year old is a better liar than this piece of shit. / []
Seeing Prince Andrew’s face light up when a certain question is ask, makes me feel like he knows something we don’t know. / ["Speaking of his face, why does he have such pointed and bad teeth if he's so royal?  I'll never get it.", "@tourdedogue4952 Because it's not America where people rip out their natural teeth to replace them with a nylon set. And because it's Britain where having such teeth is a national feature."]
honestly i have never seen that kind of stupidity what comes from Andrew. He is confusing about many lyes. You can see straight away that the man is full of shit... Also he is open to give any help to the police or fbi, but time has shown that he is hiding and not helping at all. How stupid can be that a sex offender is his best friend...He has no sympathy for the victims, he didnt regret his friendship with sexual predators, because he met with a lot of interesting people, DISCUSTING. Hope justice comes through and Andrew and his friends goes to prison to deserve what they did to the victims. / []
Andrew, every body knows that you are obsessed with sex!  I remember the model Koo Starke who you had a long affair with.  Then at that time - you refused to admit this affair!  Even old ugly Fergie knew about this affair and left you then!  Now, you and old ugly Fergie stay together - it is so sick that you two still share a house! / []
He knew what he has done what a vile man 😔 / []
This is going to kill his poor mother. / []
BBC, So why are the comments turned off on the more up to date coverage of Prince Andrew?  I for one would like to hear the opinions of the public. / []
Looks like the Queen's favourite Pudding will soon be getting his Just Deserts. / []
Prince Andrew made the error of not learning from his Mum. The Queen after all these years always holds her tongue. Never allows anyone to interview her. Her silence is her power. It was Gods will he fell into his own folly. / []
I meeeeeean, can we just applaud the interviewer AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL!!!👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽 / []
I can see only one way out for the royals is that they have him killed or he kill’s himself because this will end the queen's jubilee 😢😢😢 we will not remember it for what it is we will just remember prince Andrew and is paedophilia ways / []
He sounds so Stupid with his answer's🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ the interviewer NAILED HIS ASS! PRINCE ANDREW YOU ARE GUILTY☝🏻! / []
For someone who wasn't close to the man he had a lot of interaction with him. / []
"It was a shooting weekend. Just a straightforward shooting weekend". Yep, can confirm that's a pretty ordinary weekend for me too. / []
Liar / []
Rot in hell Andrew!! justice for the children!! / []
Like he's not in a paedo ring, yeah ok......... / []
He met with them to tell them to 🤫🤐🤐 / []
His chin is growing🤣🤣🤣🤣.... he's str8 up lying! In total, it's 10 times a year😅 / []
So many recent comments / []
Highly embarrassing feel sorry for his daughters , he is a living disgrace ! The lies in this interview are screaming from the roof tops , a 5 year old child could work out he’s clearly lying !  Lie after lie after lie ! A total embarrassment and let down to himself and most of all his daughters!  I would hate to be related to this man no matter how much money he had !  Does he not realise the entire nation no he’s LYING / ["See why they've pushed out P William and Katherine into the public duties lately?  Palace is doing major damage control - replace Andy's face with theirs and their sweet kids.  They're gonna lose some face here.  I just hope he's thrown into jail.  I don't care about anything else."]

What was it Andrew that your family have said thru countless generations?? And put many a man to death as a result??  Ignorantia juris non excusat. No excuse u horrible little man. / []
You didn’t s set at the time but your sweating during this interview hey / []
May be going on a bit now, but f**k me, the British tax payer paid the salary of all those “plenty of security”, no doubt v expensive security, for one of our princes to take avoid old stroll with sex offender!! Mental / []

I Dont go into a friendship looking for the wrong things....?!!!!??! / []
his "not being able to sweat" excuse was hilarious / ["You'd think not sweating would be a disability that stood in the way of all his medals.

Staying a sex offenders place was an “honourable thing to do”!!! What a numpty / []
This is not an interview, it’s an interrogation 😹 / []
But Meghan Markle did eat that avocado tho… Good thing the Royals have been hounding the true culprit. / []
29:46 its a  fond memory. And he is is proud of it. / []
Apparently child trafficking for the purpose of sex is legal in some cases depending on who the  person is, or where the place is, No matter how devastating an interview goes ,Or how obviously guilty someone is by their own demonstrations , Holy shit , What a royal screw up to show up and do this interview,  even though we already knew it , Andrew blew it . / []
I would have thought this to be an S.N.L. parody interview where comically the fresh Prince Andy confessed his guilt at the end of every single question , omg This interview is all the D.A. needs to convict him . / []
I don't understand these rumours business but i like the way he expresses himself and talks english. Pretty cool interview. / []
Such a tool. / []
Being a sex offender is the new unbecoming. I think he will settle out of court and the questions will forever remain unanswered. She will get a lot of money in return for her silence. Such a shame that rich people get away with anything they want. Wish we could do more to stop these people. / []
It was one if not the most expensive fuck on earth if he settles out of court for £10million / []
Interviewer: “Epstein is dead…” Andrew: “Yes” (chuckles) at 40:36 Interviewer: “…the women are now being heard” Andrew: “Quite rightly.” (suddenly serious) at 40:40 / ["She just twisted the knife! She was looking in his eyes when she said 'he is dead' to see his reaction and then... bam", 'The most telling bit of the entire interview for me. The laugh when she says he’s dead says it all phew he’s dead']
It’s unbelievable that this man ever tried to participate in a public interview knowing what he knows. What a horrendous liar and scumbag he really is. / []
He is a fool . His answers and facial expressions are so comical. Does his royal highness normally studder ? / []
It's funny how he always turns to maxwell, i invited her etc. and now she herself is in trial / []
The words coming out of his mouth but his body language is contradicting everything he is saying 😂 / []
Same behaviour and interview as Ted Bundy had..This guy is serious case!! / []
Seems like a master class in how NOT to lie. / []
I can’t even watch his awkwardness / []
I don't think he did anything he's completely baffled by it all 🤣😉 / []
This inept individual makes me cringe!Get rid of him ..mr talentless! / []

This is the biggest hogwash I've ever heard.  Clout and high standing can make you articulate stories in many ways, yet cannot explain away the obvious guilt that is being professed in this interview. Guilty! / []
Jack Profumo denied to have known Christine Keeler, Bill Clinton denied to have met Monica Lewinsky. Isn’t just a déjà vu? / []
BBC MORE LIKE RUBISH / ['GOOD ONE IOAN PARRY']
Old Princey, should not hide behind our royal family forever pretending he is safe. If he was not guilty he would have gone straight out there with some of the Queens lawyers and smashed the case out of the park. But he hasn't because he thinks he'll lose and it will bring shame to the royal family. Either way not looking good mate, so do us a favour and get on Opera in the US and make some more comedy gold TV like this. / []
This is one of those videos that will be referred back to in decades to come. / []
If it's "her" camera...she must have the original ... and the pictures authenticity can be proved or disproved.. wonder if the cameras still used film in those days? / []
Arrogant / []
Prince Andrew describes Epstein's house as a Train station.... I suppose where trains run or are ran , think I would have avoided that analogy however here is my analogy .... Train wreck , that is what this interview is . / []
My stock denial for all time, no matter how egregious the accusation: “No, it was just a straight-forward shooting weekend.”  There’s something so satisfying about watching (and rewatching) an individual this bad at lying. / ["@princedevitt8367 he was stripped of his royal/military titles today by the royal family.  not full consequences but at least he isn't given a literal royal treatment for being a pedo", '@princedevitt8367 you wait -his day in court is coming.  July.', '@alwaystired1 Also stripped of HRH!', "@princedevitt8367 while you're probably right and I have no knowledge on this, I do have a feeling being disgraced by the royal family will affect his money situation. but at the same time, there's no way he's the only royal pedo so maybe this is their public slap on the wrist and they keep him bankrolled under the table", "@princedevitt8367 definitely agree. like how other people witnessed Andrew with underaged girls, he 100% saw other people there and he 100% remembers who. \n\ndo you think he will out some people? I want to say he won't cause he's protected them so far, but also he's fallen this far, maybe that's his way to a plea deal."]
“No, it was his girlfriend I was friends with” Ahh the either convicted paedo, sex trafficer  Hasn’t aged well this answer really eh And? 🤔 / []
48:07 lol 48:35 lool 49:00 loool / []

This interview. I have to come back ever now and then. It's just too good. 2022 / ['Same here 👊!', 'me too!🤥', 'this one and the hbo axios interview with trump get me every time 😂']
His work ??? Never worked a day in his sordid life. / []
Since the interview we've come to learn that Ms Roberts was "bragging" and quite pleased with herself having met up with Andrew. We've also learned Ms Roberts also "trafficked" other girls, so in reality she is just as guilty as Maxwell hence the prosecutor did NOT call her as a witness in Maxwell's trial. I think he absolutely did have relations with this woman and it was consensual. This quite simply now is about $, someone has to pay for her new $2 million dollar home down under. / []

P.A to J.E - I have to fly from London to come visit you about something very important to me. I can't be seen with you or associate with you again, so out of respect to you, I am going to spend 4 days at your place and at some point, could we take a walk in a public park alone ( Central freakin Park, New York City ), so I have the opportunity to talk to you about not being seen with you again?  P.A - Ooops. That might have been a mistake. Yes, I'm certain that was a mistake.  Everyone else - WTF were you there to discuss with Epstein, for real, because TF it was all about not being seen with him. / []
......I don't sweat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 / []
If you can't remember whether you met her or not, then you can't remember whether you had sex with her! How convenient that your memory is foggy. / []
Here in 2022 where this gift keeps on giving. / []
Around 20:00 in when she accuses him of buying drinks, dancing with and sleeping with the girl, his excuse of being home with the children and his face says it all. He is the worst liar ever. This was a PR disaster lol. Why is he not in jail, because he is royalty? / []
Had dinner too with another ecusses the lawyer in biatin / []
That's what they all say never seen her / []
stayed with him for two days to tell him, i can t hang out with him? yeah sure, just e mail him,mate..prince is so full of it. sorry. / []
Any rational person knows you don’t stay at a convicted peadophile’s house for two days in order to tell them you can see them anymore. This man is living on a different planet / ["Oh no, he's too honourable.", 'That whole family lives on a different planet.', "he's so off he's dilusional", '"Jeffery, I can\'t see you anymore"\n"But, since I\'m here, lets party like it\'s 1999 and fk some bit*hs"', 'It was actually 4 days which is even more ludicrous.']
Sorry guys for being ignorant  of any mis facts but my understanding is the lady in question was 17 at the time and under Uk law and some US states is this not the  legal age of consent  ? im probably missing some facts though if he is guilty of a crime then i hope he faces justice. / []
This case proves that the monarchy is long dead. Back when their power was real and if royalty did this sort of thing, no one would dare challenge it or they would be swiftly taken care of. / []
What work?  You mean grifting. / []
7:10 “He never said nothing about it.” Love the Freudian slip. / ['I think he said " he never said anything about it " but still he\'s a BS liar']

Soon. / []
He dose not buy he's giving ? / []

What a waste of space andrew is. Some time in the Tower of London is appropriate. He lives off mummy’s money. He’s not royal he’s a joke 😂 / []
25:11 Him explaining its not him in the picture, because he usually wears a suit and a tie :D  if he gets convicted maybe he can break through as a comedian, i mean his talent is undeniable! / []

Disappear you 2nd rate excuse / []
Pants on 🔥 / []
Even moderately well-off ppl do not have people in and out of their home, so much  so to call it a railway station. With even slight affluence often comes paranoia and suspicion of others. Epstein was staggeringly wealthy and everyone he allowed around him would have been someone he would be sure who'd  keep quiet. I am sure every regular staff person was well paid x3 of the pay they'd get for the same work anywhere else. His home was a private elite access club, and those allowed a  presence there were either a) servicing the club and it's owner, b) the owner,  or c) the club guests. Andrew was a knowing guest. He's lying. / ['Exactly.']
He needs to be sent to the Wall & join the Kights Watch. / []
Body language 'guilty' Andrew you are a lying shit .You should go to jail. / []
That’s a picture of me 😂  My travelling clothes. Omg this interview is so funny. / []
In this interview Andrew displays all the intelligence, imagination and cheek of a 10 year old boy who just got caught by the Nanny for helping himself to a second helping of Jam Roly Poly. / ["Ffs... I'm dying."]
Hows this dude this dumb? And why didnt he just say “im the f’n orince of england not Ramadi…many people run ip to me to snap photos” done next question…this guy “ uh uh uh uh while shaking profusely…i dont remember…I never did it… no im going to stick with my first answer indknt remember..:thats right I dont remember” / []
Medical condition that I don't 😓sweat 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
John brolyn that expression 😆give him away... / []
Duded compeltly disconnect from the real world and how every day people actually think. He thinks everyone is dumb is is believeing what hes sayin as if hes proud of himself for being such a good actor. Its like his PR guy was a stud in the 90s and did not know how to keep up with the times so his material and BBC oaching is a hige reflection in this interview of his PR, manager and mentors. Its all out dated. / []
This guy is disgusting / []
hes lying like crazy / []
The most powerful fam in political power says.......LOL .... "working class hero"... / []
And he thought that doing this interview may be a good idea….. / []
...I think an innocent person would reply "no" to these accusations instead of "I don't think so" when it comes to having sex with underage girls, but that's just me. Also, it is one thing to be with Epstein when he didn't know about his sex trafficking (I doubt he never knew about it) but it is quite another to go back and see him afterwards, especially if you think sex trafficking is wrong. It is not cowardly to phone call them and say  "hey you're accused/convicted of something illegal (and disgusting), I don't think we should be friends" since afterall, he "wasn't best friends with him" anyways. You'd also think, if he was innocent, he would show compassion for the women that were trafficked. Even if these women were making it up (which I find hard to believe, but the law states you are innocent until proven guilty...but that photo though, damn he shouldn't be able to wiggle out of this one, but he has money/power so who knows) your reaction and demeanor should be not on edge, as well as not making long winded answers to Emily's questions...if you're accused of something that 100% didn't happen, your answer should be "no" because it simply didn't happen. / []
Good grief he lost it from the beginning when he kept talking,  suppose to try an control the interview, then makes one mistake after another. But the worse thing he said, that he couldn’t be linked to Epstien cos it would make him look bad, NOT tell him he’s a Pedophile and can’t stand being in his company!. As anyone would do, especially someone who apparently works with the NSPCC!!! / []
Royalty, being reminded that their not special. Hopefully we can remind them that royals have and still can be taken to the guillotine / []

The FBI might want to talk to him before long. The royalty shield he takes for granted doesn’t look too secure now. Virginia Guiffre might be the least of his problems, but her case has flushed him out into the open for the FBI. / ["It's tied in with Trump though. Trump used this to blackmail his way into a royal visit.  This I would guess is either the very start or the very end of it. Guilt on both ends."]

“I met him through his girlfriend”…isn’t that the one  who was just sentenced? The “management”…? / []
His attempts to explain away the evidence of his obvious misdeeds are so cringeworthy. The guy is as guilty as sin and his explanations are beyond incredulous. He is actually insulting people's intelligence with his contemptuous answers. / ['I couldn’t agree more!']
I can't believe no-one has spoofed this! / []
I can´t help but think that the idea of the interview was put forward by his former wife and he accepted without realising what the consequences would be. Great minds think alike after all / []
I was raped in 2001 by a prince when I was 17. Three times! Sex isn't abuse. If you regret sex it jsnt rape. If your jealous of your sex partner it isn't rape. If you are rich and your sex partner isn't, it isn't rape. Women aren't stupid, even 17 year old women, even if they pretend to be. And they pretend to be stupid all the time. I will pretend to be stupid for millions. Narcassists always play victim. / []
Who was the guy that took 26 flights to the island? / []

Gather the mob and  your self-righteous torches for a virtue-signaling witch hunt -  again, the media needs everyone to abandon critical thinking.  "Forcing" a 17 year old girl to have sex with a prince 20 years ago and now if you call it abuse, you get $950,000. Btw i had sex with him also, and I'm severely traumatised. And before I go to a party I screen everyone's criminal record. The interviwer manipulates legal term  "charges" and convictions and accusations along with criminal and civil matters, "under age", "young girls" and teenagers and she knows it. The age of consent is 16. News flash men are attracted to young women and young women attracted to rich, successful men - they are called strip clubs.  This entire story is a sham. Its a money maker for the press and y'all are being manipulated because you resent the wealthy. Next the media is digging up  Hugh Hefner and convicting all the playboy bunnies. / ['Is that you Andrew.', '@stanstan7426 🤣']

Too right a call between them dates he was living nearly a normal life  Jeff at office 12 13 hrs a day / []
Maxwell would go no where without Jeff ever  they knew 5he plus one was him ? / []
Far to many witnesses now / []
They never thought that this would happen with the n d a / []
Maxwell was worse / []
Us a knew so did England   authorities / []
Shameful by the Prince !!! An excellent interviewer / []
36:51 that choke. / []
1:56 'he had an extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together...' Yeah, NONCES. / []
You either had sex with someone other than your wife especially a minor or NOT, there is nothing to remember or not remember about it! He is such a big JOKE! / []
I can ask the laughing at this man lol 😂🤣😂😂 this is hilarious / []
I’m going to break up a meaningless friendship and stay at my future former friends house for 4 days. 😂😂😂😂 / []
I've watched this interview several times, I just love to watch elites like this guy "crack". Bill Gates should be next on the chopping block. / []
Get all ye checkbooks out... / []
cringy cringe / []
A totally unacceptaptable face of our monarchy - dreadful lies, his performance here is nothing short of woefully pathetic, his account of their 'walk in thepark' is quite simply pathetic.  The way he pretends to be surprised at some of the questions is just laughable at best.  He is full of lies. / []
I’m shadow banned by YouTube! It’s a bit like Ponce Andrew trying to shut his victims up! / []
So funny that he repeatedly says it would “not be honorable” or “it would be improper for me to be seen with you,” in reference to Jeffrey. Not I am repulsed by what you’ve done or I can’t be friends with someone that does something like that, but rather I just don’t want people seeing me with you... like obviously he’s a lying, it’s just a weirdly poor way to go about it. / []
Everyone around him should be fired now (as well as then)! / []
Guilty !! He is an an accomplishment liar & a child abuser ! / []
He remembers Pizza express but not the sex with the minor 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ / []
Love watching him digging his own grave 😂 / []
Even the dumb and blind can sense he is GUILTY!!!! / []
This man is a miserable lying oaf and the taxpayers of UK are stuck paying his legal bills. 💰💰💰 / []
A todler would lie more convincing. He keeps shaking his head no, when lying through his teeth🤣🤣🤣🤣 His whole body rejects his lies🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
🤔 what is that smell cow no goat--_----- NO IT'S BULLSH1T / []
That's his hand in the photo , everytime he's snapped out by the interviewer he flaps his hands around . Can't mistake the fact that's his pudgy little hand and fingers in the photo. When the sweating was brought up he dropped himself in it by his involuntary mouth movements. Obviously his sweating being brought up bothered him / []
Guilty!  .go testify .. and  put a closure !. / []
Commonly known as Randy Andy / []
Bet he's sweating now. / []
Now you do understand why there was a Russian Revolution and a german family got shot. / []
This interview aged like milk. / []
I am for punishing the guilty party at maximum level , but at the same time I am against awarding the lawyers and the presume victim, this should not be an example of how young girls could make money. This should set an example, you go wrong, you will not be getting any award from it. I am afraid that some young girls get bad ideas out of this story. As for the lawyers , you do it on probono, you are not going to take 50% awards out of people misery. / []
Car crash interview. The Queen just announced Prince Andrew’s funeral for his car accident next month. / []
Doesn’t he love the word ‘catagorically’ !!!!!!!!! / []
The date WE have (who are the WE) / []
What is it with British Royalty and "stumble-speak".....They can't articulate a straighforward sentence start to finish: they start and stop, repeat, bumble along and eventually get most of it out: not all mind you. Both Charles and Andrew are absolute experts at this......its absolutely BIZARRE / []
They all live off public money.  Makes me laugh when they say the royal family have private means and money of their own, going back centuries, where did it all come from ?  Off the backs of the working class.  Was it ever thus.  And of course they make sue they keep reproducing, so it will go on and on …………… / []
Why would you go for a ‘walk in the park’ to discuss such serious matters.  Wouldn’t you do it in Epstein’s house behind closed doors.  What a lying little scumbag he is.  I’m English, so help, all us English keep this lot in the manner to which they are accustomed.  Andrew doesn’t work anymore, he’s in hiding.  How is he earning a living.  Maybe he’s claiming benefits 🤣😩 / []
I’m no body language expert but it’s awfully suspicious that when he’s denying anything that he was involved in his eyes shutter open and shut and he’s trips over his own words 😭☠️🪦  Emily the interviewer seems so calm and collected it’s quite funny / ['Yes the crazy blinking and constant stuttering are a dead giveaway he’s being dishonest']
Just Another in a long line of royal wrong un's!!!!!!!! / []
This got hushed up and pushed under the Royal Rug / []
This sniveling jellyfish now has legal his team questioning if the extended statues of limitations in regards to sex offenders is actually constitutional. / []
Shaking his head no through the entire interview. Engaging in twisted puppet parties with "cosmopolitan" elitists. No no no no no no... but... ummmm... uhhhhh... nooooo no noooo. Oh wait yes.... uhhhh... nooooo. / []
Convinced!! He didn't do it / []
Dirty Harry is the Party Prince. / []
The Queen mum refused to pay his legal bills / []
This man is guilty as sin and I am so happy to hear the Queen won’t be covering his legal bills!! Justice for Virginia!! / []
The grand old Duke of Pork doesn't sweat?  Bet he is starting to now...the Maxwell criminal clan will bring him down. / []
If you don't know Mr Brockman why react like you have seen a ghost when she mentioned his name and a second or two after he said really. It was after she mentioned his name that she spoke about what Mr Brockman witnessed. No one reacts like that when you mention someone's name that you don't know which he stated about 20 secs after he said really.  Got him your out do not pass go do not collect any money from the Commonwealth and go to jail. / []
Let he that is without sin cast the first stone .How many of us would like to go back and change things . / []
I’m confused, he said he was a plus one? He should not have done this interview. / []
Said something along the lines, that he didn't have any regrets with his friendship with Epstein because of the connections & contacts he made thru the friendship.  Whoa Whoa Whoa; Andrew is completely ignoring and dodging that these important "contacts" were made thru a PEDOPHILE and TRAFFICKER.  NO CONTACT is worth THAT!  In the TOP 5 WORSE answers Andrew gave.  Truly stunning & sickening. / []
Who flew on the Lolita Express to Epstein’s Island ??  What are the names of all the pedophiles on the flight logs ??  Where are the investigative journalists ??  Mainstream Media protects the wealthy pedos, eh ?? / []
The grand old Duke of Pork / []
Amazing the problems that a prostitute can give you. / []
Yer done son…. Yer done / []
I shouldn't laugh because there are many girls affected by this and related stories but OMG what a big fat liar! He sounds like all my mates when they've been caught cheating by their gf's, explaining what is wrong with every little detail of the story and the accusation they are faced with 🙄🙄 pizza express FFS 😅😅😅😅 he only wears suit and tie in london...🤣🤣🤣 I hope he get's what's coming to him. / []
She should of asked him about his brothers best mate . Old Jimmy Savile / []
He describes Epsteins house like a railway station the horrible abuse of young women in that house  must have been on a  gigantic scale far bigger than you and me or anyone could ever imagine.. / []
So what do we learn from this guys? If you have money and power you are above the law. / []
I had to go see him… he is not my friend?? / []
I cannot see how this is the Queen’s favorite child. He is a shame and an embarrassment. Full stop. No judgement at all across all of these people. Racism, media bullying, pedophilia, all okay by the Royals. How are the Brits okay bankrolling this craziness?? / []
“…. there as absolutely no indication, and if there was… 🤦‍♀️🙄” / []
Surprised his nose ain't growing / []
Show the RP LOGS and bring up the RP members as witnesses! Problem solved! / []
I believe him😂😂😂 / []
people who think 17 is pdo are highly brainwashed and a bit of a plank / []

2001: can't remember meeting, dancing or drinking at a nightclub with a 17 year old girl  Also 2001: yes I went to pizza express, I had the supreme extra cheese / []
3 minutes in and it’s already a load of shit. / []
This interview is a train wreck. A goldfish can tell his story is a pack of lies. 😂 / []
Your Royal Highness . . . / []
Are there any people that have respect for this man, that are proud of him being the Son of The Queen of England? / []
Not just does he reek with lies, he does it badly.. Spoiled brat.. / []
I DIDNT SWEAT AT THE TIME BUT I DO NOW 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 HE SHOULD OF BEEN A COMEDIAN 🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
😱 "It was a convenient place to stay"  WTF 😱😱😱 / []
2 year's on. still no justice  There never will be. This will be strung out and till has old and his had his royal live. Justice will only be served when he meets his maker IE the devil. Now Andrew take a lie detector test. Or are you to scared You will be coult out. Lie after lie and he calls him self a gentleman Lol. DELUDED. And such a bad lier / []
On 10 seperate occasions,  Visiting a known paedophiles private island where maxwell also visited , is not a mistake,  you should face the full force of the law . / []
Who came here from Trash Taste / []
He cant even speak properly at certain points lol.. He's so pathetic / []
"You have to understand"?? What??? / ['I found that patronising too!']
You are a liar! / []
If Andrew took a polygraph whilst being interviewed the energy coming from the machine could have kept the country running for 3 years solid. / ['Lol', '😂😂😂', "I disagree, I think he believes what he's saying and would pass all tests.", '🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣', 'You are so mean! 🤣🤣🤣']
Don’t worry Charlie, if they had concrete shit, they wouldn’t be questioning you, you good lil baby 😭 / []
Paedophile!!! Your not above the law! / []
I dont get how people in the UK sit and willingly pay for these Royals and pay for his defense without a protest at the very least. / []
I think Randy Andy qualifies to play both roles in a remake of Dumb and Dumber. I wonder if other members of the Royal Family have watched this disaster? / []
By looks of him I thought he was gay. / []
I dont have a message for her.  I have been wrongly accused of having sex with you..but i dont have a message for you..lordy!! / []
Known fact that andys nose grew over an inch by the time the interview was finished. / []
Body language and language. Notice how quickly he mentions mr epstein. He couldnt say it quick enough / []
He's bloody sweating now! / []
She's a fantastic interviewer...and I'm literally laughing at all his obvious lies. 😂😂😂 / []
Im cringing on his behalf...🧐 / []
That a shame p Andrew it's 2022 and you still talk about it is a disgrace ...you are a monster 👻 👽 and you need help. / []
You don't fucken remember anything???? Too much drugs or magic mushrooms. Get the fuck over it!!!!!!!!!! / []
Sweat??? U will be fucken sweating tonight!!!! / []
If that would o happen ed to my daughter you wouldn't be fucken alive!!! I am going to have the KGP up on you sleep tight / []
Lying cxxt / []
“unbecoming?…he was a sex offender.” I CANT- / []
Just a minute!...  Andrew recognise the man in the picture is him, OK.  But the picture, says Andrew, could a fake, as it is the picture of a picture of a picture. OK, let's follow that argument... The man in the picture its him!...  So, where is the original?... Somebody must have that original, with Andrew dressed like that but in a different environment, because “he never went upstairs!”... The original should show him hugging or partially embracing, maybe the trunk of a tree!!... Or in Rome or the Acropolis, hugging an ancient marble statue!... Somebody took that picture of him!... A very lucky photographer who has now the chance to solve this mess for once and all!... And maybe, receive a handsome reward from the eternally grateful Queen, as the saviour of her favourite son! So, where is the original?... Where is the lucky Paparazzi?... Of course, Andrew's staff must be crazy looking for him and the original all over the world. / []
13:44 best moment / ['Lol yeah.... he was like a cartoon character in that moment']
6:35...  Whoever was the princes handler was is floating in a moat somewhere as this guy should have NEVER EVER been allowed in front of a camera... just look at the body language on him during this question... as soon as he figured out what she was about to bring up he became as uncomfortable and as squirmy as anyone can get!!  I'd LOVE to play poker with him...   I'd be kicking the queen out of her thrown because her son lost the Palace to an inside strait... / []
Loyalists of Northern Ireland, this shit head and his family are what you pledge allegiance to.  When have they ever come to NI and celebrated July 12 / []

he sounds like a child with crayons saying they dint draw on the wall / []
he don't remember taking picture with a girl he just slept with..he's going to jail / []
19:30 "I was never in Trums with her, there ae a numbers of things that are wrong with that story, one of which I that I DONT KNOW WHERE THE BAR IS IN TRUMPS, I don't drink, I have never bought a drink in Trumps, WHEN EVER I WAS THERE" / []
The English deserve these sponge's / []
we need one of those Body consultants who can determine the way Andrew holds himself and moves says if this man is lying to me he looks well guilty and i would say he lied through most of this video / []
🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
He lies from the first word to the last with childish arguments. He must think that citizens are stupid. His face is so congested that it looks like he's going to have a heart attack. I hope justice will be done. This man is not above anything or anyone. / ['@Dog boy Yes, hopefully yes. If not the institution more soon than later will suffer the consequences. The terrible way they treated Diana still in the mind of all the British citizen\n.', 'Hopefully YES.']
Your Royal Highness thank you as she pulls the lever for the trap door / []
This video is very useful for English learners like myself. You can pick up lots of useful words and phrases from it because this gentleman is lying very clearly and distinctively / []
His eyes and face when she asks about a Russian girl giving him a foot massage😂 He never expected that question 😀 / []
See no evil  ,hear no evil ...say no lies. / []
PEADO!!!!!!! / []
Why did you stay with a sex offender? Answer, I went to tell him it was inappropriate to see him so I  took a flight over the Atlantic to tell him in person and stay in his home . Remove the HRH and all the other privileges he has. He is a disgrace. / []
I can’t believe my eyes and ears. “It was a convenient place to stay” like there would have been nowhere else more appropriate.  This is atrocious, the obvious amount of lies told. Taking no accountability and the worst but not showing any remorse towards the victims! GUILTY as can be.  The interviewer did amazing, good job / ["He's a Prince and can do as he likes.  Don't be a jealous peasant  !!!", '@servantofvaisnavas who’d be jealous of an sex offender', "@leahaax6210 it all depends how you look at it.  I would just call him an opportunist.  Most other men if given the same opportunity, would most likely behave the same way.  The girl already got some huge payout.  I guess she's just butthurt that she didn't become royalty.", '@servantofvaisnavas pardon? Most men would turn a blind eye or assist someone in sex trafficking underage girls ? If given the chance? Most certainly not any men I know. What an odd thing to say. God help you', '@servantofvaisnavas I look at it how it is. This man shows no remorse throughout the interview where he quite clearly has a part to play in sex traffic of underage vulnerable females. If not that continued to support and have a relationship with a convicted sex offender This someone whom is in the royal family, does that not concern you!?']
BBC jimmy savile , make sure the royal family are ok 👎🏻 / []
This wasn't an interview, it was an interrogation. / []
What a slug. / []
Honestly, all credit goes to Emily. If it was anybody else apart from her they would have fckd it up. She uses her feminine attributes with great talent in manipulating him into a false sense of security and like any idiot male in his shoes out comes all of his nonsense with a burst. Although, there are instances where her journalistic instincts take over and she goes into the kill mode but she is able to maintain a state of calmness which gets him to dig his own grave. / []
He is a bad liar…lol / []
Yes, a known convicted sexual predators home is a convenient place to stay….Right…. / []
His pants are on fire. / []
I don't go into a friend ship going into the wtong thing i want to learn im an engaing person bro pricne Andrew is  nice guy leave him alone feds he will hack the planet let him live hes the best guy in the world when it comes to discipline / []
Every part of his body is rejecting everything coming out of his mouth. He should have been asked if he would agree to a polygraph. / []
Sounds like British intelligence failed the Royals, never giving this clown a heads up about a known pervert.   LMAO - no one believes this clown. / []
I wish people like this were struck with the same chronic illnesses and diseases that unfortunate yet innocent-as-can-be indivuduals like me experience.  HOW DARE HE SIT THERE AND LIE WHILST OTHERS SUFFER? The queen should be ashamed of herself for raising such a disgusting creature. / []
Amazingly intelligent interviewer and great analysts' comments I have enjoyed and learn from here; people are damn intelligent to spot whatever is wrong or right. Sad the Prince was in this position yet dancing around stark evidence (God forgive my wrong judgment if at all).  More saddening for me are the secret abuses and other crimes ongoing as we listen and write! My lesson: live right and let live right...in the secret and the open. God help me...through Christ Jesus to live a worthy live in the secret and the open. May I never have to be interviewed on such embarrassing suspicions and subjects! I pray same for you. / ['Did you find her accent hard to understand?']
Pathetic privileged perpetrators, especially white ones, will never face consequences for their actions. / []
I believe him! / []
He should be telling this to a judge / []
Dear Prince Andrew, please be a role model and give justice to the case. Return the dignity and life to those young girls and face and accept the responsibility for your actions. Do not pass on the wrong and the pain that was done to you. It takes real strength and honour to be open about one's faults, even more so in a position of constant public attention and scrutiny, but in the end, we are all humans, we all have our shortcomings and there are many men out there with a weakness for the charms of youth and power (not saying you should follow up on it, but it is out there, it should not be shushed and hidden away, but acknowledged as one of life's challenges so we as humans can find a new way of dealing with it). Show the world and your own children that you are man and father enough to stand up for your share of the crime. I would have deep respect for you. Please help for the other men involved to come clean, too (as clearly there must be more than just two perpetrators in this case). Help the world become a better place. All my love to the women who were abused, may they find comfort, healing and peace. / []
What he describes as a railway station , id call it more a school corridor , tbh . Dirty wrong un / []
Are there no street camera roll people can check ? / ['Daniel Billington lol 😂 😂😂😂 tx 😍']
The Queen is just a female Jeff E who hasnt been caught or ever will be caught for it / []
Whole family are satanic religious pedophiles that's why they own what they own they sold out more to lucifer than anyone ever has the amount of child trafficking the royals are responsible for is insane / []
Best part for me is when the interview asks about Jeffery found dead, his reaction was stone cold, body language, confirms he knew about his death, in sense the best way to put his reaction is when you explain something happened and you actioned it as it was a problem.   At guess prob had something to do with it as an overlord so he wasn't implicated.  Also the part where he said there are very few photos of us together, meaning there is more-and have not been found where's the stash? / []
What a joke 😂 / []
This guy is one bad cookie.  But how can Virginia Guiffre claim abuse and being trafficked when she is smiling in the pictures and out at clubs dancing and having fun? / []
Maitlis is good.  We dont need to be a professional to see he is lying 🤥.  He is trying too hard to hide. / []
The thing is this is such an easy thing for him to disprove.  Its obvious (and well known) that the 'firm' keep their appointment books for years and years to say 'oh yes I last saw you in 2010 blah blah'.   So if he was innocent then he could show the world.  But the dude says he had to 'work' to regain the ability to sweat (why would anyone want to do that), that he never went upstairs, is incapable of staying in a posh hotel, doesn't recall getting massages from the 'little people who work in a house' so couldn't know if they were women, Russian, children or oompa loompas.  But worst of all is the fact he will walk away from all this because he is royalty. / []
Not the sharpest knife in drawer. Too much inbreeding. / []
my guess is probably a slow intercourse session, with state of the art aircon at the holiday fxuk house, but cctv everwhere (as per netflex's epstein filthy rich), thus not suprised may not remember the sweating. but he ll remember the action unless it happens a lot. / []
Ugh… ughh… 😂this is truly a manipulator / []
Coz you have to remember that at the time he was patron of the NPCC so he ‘knew signs of’ child abuse and he only set things up. Because of his good friend Ghislaine….oh no….she’s not ‘innocent’ anymore. So erm ehh eh erm. Oh no / []
Four chins / []
This should be turned into a A-level of pure lies. / []
wow i cants stop laughing the prince is so nervous ...what a bad liar / []
Andrew is one of the most twisted boring person I have ever listened to... Well done on the journalist for keeping her cool / []
From 42'50 to 43'10 : "If I was... able to give sensible answers... I'd love it... but I can't." 😅 / []
I get why the screw youtube algorythm has brought this back but whats the point ? We all know this f  ker is guilty of the same shit as epstein and maxwell. / []
Worldwide pedo network exposed implicating Gill Bates, Cill Blinton, Tonald Drump, Dlan Aershowitz and many many more begins to unravel............ then all of a sudden these same people will save us from the covid they set loose.........  It's a cull. / []
your opinion was coloured  by  your sex drive! / []
hahaha, after Epstein was releassed, I had to go and see him, to tell him: we can't see each other again, .........hahaha, he could not do it on the phone? Yeah xure we believe  you,  haha / []
“Tendency to be too honorable????” / []
Knowing  Epstein was a convicted sex offender in 2006 but went back to stay for 4 days  in 2010 to break off a  friendship  its hilarious nonsense makes Randy Andy look  so stupid / []
I have to say I believe him in what he says / ['Statically 1% of the population will believe him, the other 99% have an working brain.', '@stanstan7426 and some ppl will get my humour', '@matthewwilliams8311 Much too accurate though, like me you must know quite a few sheep who think that all the Royals are beyond reproach.']
Bet he's sweating BADLY now. / []
He joined the navy he wasnt smart enough to go to university  not the sharpest tool in the box very average  intelligence maybe below after what we have seen in this interview . / []
He does not lie well. Must HORRIFY the Queen. LMFAO. / []
No no no no no i dont sweat and that smell you are privvy to right now is not me shitting myself its actually COMPLETE ROYAL BULLSHIT .....Whot Whot yaaaa. / []
Prince Adrew when his young  new paper  exposure slot model and young girls around him because he is a Prince that so many  even  thousands girls want be his girlfriend every one claims his former girlfriend  I think our Queen go bankrupt / []
I didn’t feel like he lied until 9:31 into the interview. How very sad. / ['@c I hear you. No matter so very sad!']
This man talking about how this accusation is just for money. You a broke old ugly man, you use taxpayers money and the royal name to get in ew 😂 get over yourself Andrew, we ain't dumb peasants out here, / []
Palace 5hreating American anchor ? / []
They forget the British people can see American news and documentrys like him tooooooooooo / ['No, they should have let Steve Sackur do the interview!']
very poor acting skills! sorry / []
He doesn't sweat?!?? Oh yeah?! Put him in a SAUNA - we'll soon find out if he can sweat or not!! / []
Wth a time think looking at this I think he is guilty you can tell? / []
Think he guilty / []
Let us accept that everything he says is true....he has used public money to convince people that he didn't do anything wrong, public money to fight legal battles and will use public money to rehabilitate him if he is found guilty. Must feel good to be privileged / []
Wow.. perfectly telling body language and words.. / []
He lies like a 9 year old who has stolen some sweets / []
The French had the right idea with their royal family. Off with their heads! / []
Watching in 2022. Waiting for the judges decision.. what about the footage of him letting a young girl out of epsteins house.  He is squirming.  GUILTY.   He should not be above the law. JUSTICE FOR THE GIRLS. / []
Oooof this is painful imagine coming on the news and everyone knows your gonna lie so you lie sooooooo bad he had rehearsal before this you can tell / []
He has definitely done it🤮 / []
He looks confused  and  his speech is  full of conflicting  incidents. / []
The head shaking is really annoying 🙄 / []
So you're telling me he stayed at his home so many times & NEVER saw 1 child or graphic photos of kids ALL AROUND HIS HOMES.....LIES! So the UK will fund this evil criminal all because who he is & how much money he has & he will walk free & lose a title if this was a normal bloke he would be in jail  HES A CRIMINAL SO SHOULD BE IN JAIL LIKE EVERY OTHER HUMAN! / []
Love how he distances himself from the sex trafficker Epstein and says he was in his company and his guest due to his friendship with his girlfriend...the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, no matter how much you deny, deflect and distance you cannot escape the FACT that this horrible man is guilty as hell. / []
I think that Prince Andrew was honourable in trying not to utterly condemn a man who was once a friend because it was the PR thing to do. I think this girl is just trying to make money out of the situation. What 17 year old girl in the right mind would be groomed anyway? She was not a poor orphan- she had a father and by British law over the age of consent. POOR LITTLE GIRL! I don't think so. Leave Prince Andrew alone. He may have made a mistake but that does not make him a criminal or a paedophile. H / []
Haha oh dear Andy / []
He’s essentially immune from any type of prosecution, being the son of the sitting monarch. This interview is as damming as a confession but nothing will be done. No consequences. Power rules above all else / ['Agree, nothing will happen to him', "What if the U.S. requests extradition? There is an extradition treaty with the U.S.. The court ruled today that the lawsuit may proceed. If he doesn't show there will be a default judgement.", '@nonsensefactory WRONG. Already stripped of his titles and military ranks.', 'Only the monarch is immune from prosecution', "@jamesnorman6831 He's no longer an HRH and word has it that the queen would like to see him deposed. That's just a formal interview. If the US makes Interpol make an arrest warrant\n The U.K. and US have extradition treaties with each other. Failure to show up for court would be a summary judgment and he wouldnt be able to travel anymore. I think the Queen want to keep the ronald scandal free. Even if it means turning in Andrew."]
I hate when my judgement is clouded by my tendency to be too honourable / []
Will justice be served? No chance, he's part of the elite and the elite will ensure he is protected. / []
And they thought Panorama  was bad !!!!! / []
‘Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake’ - Napoleon Bonaparte / []
This is soooooooo painful to watch, to see him squirming in his chair and going blood-red at all the interviewer's questions.  I'm no professional body language expert, but he's clearing lying, desperately trying to "damage control" it all. I'm writing this in early January 2022, and since his "friend" Ghislaine Maxwell has now been found guilty, I'm praying the US powers-that-be now FORCE him to give a deposition on this. He's managed to escape any consequences thus far; let's hope that does not continue. PLUS, the way he laughed when Emily said "Now Epstein's dead", was like "yeah, thank God, I'm off the hook with him not here to spill the beans." Total relief.  EMILY: you did a brilliant job of this interview, you were fierce, relentless, dogged...well done, you! / []
Anyone back here watching this again for a good old laugh? Surprised he didn't wear a bib, to collect all that shite falling out of  his mouth.. / []
Who is this guy and what in the blazers is he talking about? Who is Gill Ayne? Why does he eat winnets? / []
Royalty ? Dog shit...!!! / []
THANK YOU ANDREW. I HAVEN'T LAUGHED THIS HARD IN MONTHHSSSSSSS / ['Wow that ending tho wow']
woman is not an object for royalty, nor for any self-respecting person. Good thing there are pictures showing him, otherwise he looks like he's never been there with her / []
You remember everything in detail, dates, places, purpose etc., except the attractive seventeen-year old girl. Obviously there's a good reason for Americans' rebellion against the British Crown. Despite all their faults American collective psyche will not cater to any royal ... / []
I think Prince Andrew has a 'peculiar medical condition' which prevents him from telling the truth. / []
I feel sorry that the Queen gave birth to this man. / ['Funded his lifestyle too']
That man would crack on trial ;) / []
Andrew - "[Epstein] was in and out, all over the place..."   So it seems. / []
Sir you are pathetic and a disgrace to decent men and the Royal family. / []
He don't remember her she's grew up since then he was at home with other children sick freak / []
You can tell he is lying his lips are moving / []
He has a busy schedule between private jets and molesting children he don't know whether he's coming or going lol / []
One contradiction after the other. If he gets away with this case then that’s when you can confirm the law system is rigged!!! I’m praying that justice gets served, especially for those victims that have had to live with this ever since. / ["i didn't see him contradicting himself but he is as guilty as hell", '@A. A. Agreed! His “sentencing” will never resemble that which would be served of a “straightforward” person. 🙄']
A pure blooded Liar that must be imprisoned for his crimes to humanity both under age and of age. Down with the Monarch. / []
It wasn't me it was Patricia😄 / []
This whole interview is Cringe 😭😭 I can’t! I can’t !! / []
12:12 and beyond….it’s the stutter for me…. Keep digging dude. / []
Ha he said it was impossible for him to sweat at the time because of a medical condition.. / []
I love how this was done BEFORE she got convicted of all these horrible crimes….as if what he’s saying is somehow justified because he was HER friend…. Lord, this interview did not age well for him. / ['I know it’s so embarrassing!!', 'Lol for real tho. What was he thinking? He has all the education, advice, and resources in the world at his disposal and this is what he does 🤣🤣 \nSaying Ghislaine was his good friend, not Epstien, putting it all on his close friendship with her. Then Ghislaine gets convicted.. watching all this unfold over the past 2 years has been shocky, sad, and kind of hilarious 😆 No wonder Queen Elizabeth II kicked his ass to the curb. I mean, what other option did she have? Even without him being officially convicted in a court of law, the public knows he\'s guilty, his family knows he\'s guilty, there\'s photographic evidence, along with witnesses and evidence of him being on Epstiens planes and visiting his homes around the world. \nDon\'t even get me started on his ridiculous excuses during this interview, especially the "Well that can\'t be true because I don\'t sweat" "Staying in the house of a convicted sex offender was just a convenient place to stay." Uh.. yea.. convenient place to get "massages" from teenage girls. It\'s just unreal honestly. I thought members of the royal family all have their own PR team. WHO TOLD HIM THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?? It\'s embarrassing to be in the same Species as this chomo..', 'Yes. Lol', "He's innocent", '@babagandu Mmhmmm ok. 👍🏽']
Things that stand out to me , he has stayed at palm beach... the house was full of nude pictures  of nude minors.. yet he said he had no inclinations or suspicion s of what was going on... also I have seen a video  of him waving goodbye to a young girl in the doorway of the manhattan mansion in New York. It's  unbelievable.  The head of the child protection  charity.  Its creepy / []
what a stupid and immature DH.  Virginia is the only thing he doesn't remember anything about and yet he remembers absolute irrelevant nonsense.  He is the worst Liar, had to have a meeting with Epstein to tell him he doesn't want to see him again,   HA HA HA HA   sorry can't help myself / []
Please God ...lock him away like his dear friends....never a gain hurt baby girls.!! His a pure liar...... It doesn't matter that he is Royal...he must be treated as we are all treated. Personally... His a complete liar and should now be where his dear friend is.... Problem is...his shit scared,and he,Looks for the protection from mum. / []
Look at his body language and his facial expressions after every question.........liying all the way from start to finish......... / []
It’s painful to watch,what a sheltered privilege life he’s had,your legal advisers would say never speak again you dim witted buffoon / []
I reckon after the interview they were all high fivung each other and popping champagne! " we got him!, he is so fucked" lol / []
I was listening to this while working out back in my factory and was literally jumping around out of the cringe lol...soooolo dumb lol / []
Of course, this is a trainwreck happening before our very eyes but, despite the obvious lies, clear guilt & hubris, the most bizzare parts are when he laughs or smiles at the weirdest times.  "Jeffrey is dead"  *Chuckle*..."yes'  The fuck is wrong with this dude? / []
So he stopped sweating because being shot at was stressful ?  He says he doesn’t recall the photo being taken because he never went upstairs … how does he know photo was taken upstairs ?? / []
Why would you have to go and break up with a "plus one " thousands of miles away  , / []
Being badly behaved doesn’t mean that you’ve broken the law, which Prince Andrew hasn’t even if she was telling the truth about their meeting in London when she was *above* the age of consent.  There is only one fact so far in her case against him. That she is suing him for an unspecified amount. The $500k from Epstine and the other $7 million must be running out.  Money, money, money. The whole thing stinks of someone trying to get a payday. Target the rich ones first. / ['Andrew is that you?']
Damn she strategically took him apart at the seams while maintaining a calm and helping demeanor. / []
its obvious that Prince Andrew is not thinking like just you and me, he has a mind on his own and act accordingly. / []
For God sake leave him alone. / []
Yes, of course, a group of emancipated young people living "La vida loca" with selective memory now want $$$$ and a minute of fame. A multi-million dollar empire with very famous clientele, but none of the girls mention Bill Clinton as a customer, poor Andrew has paid for the broken dishes / []
Do the interview again, bet the answers will be different as he's clearly just winging it / []
He had to wrack his brains to remember if he slept with VR?!!! Why didn't he say something like 'No definititely not, I' ve had a small number of sexual partners and she is not one of them"  That would be more honest if he was an innocent man. / []
And then there is  Lord Porchester ! Who is the daddy ? / []
Put him in prison🙄he is guilty, everyone can see that / []
For some reason I can't stop laughing...the stuttering, the walking back of statements, the entire thing is an epic fail and hilarious! / ['Same . The “ that picture was taken upstairs I didn’t go upstairs “ after claiming it’s all photoshop 😭']
What a face of guilt / []
Yes he is tripping his self up all the time, oh yes it's deffinatly meeee / []
Prince Andrew could have phoned Jeffrey epstine to tell him he wasn't going to see him anymore without haveing to go and see him to tell him he wasn't going to see him again, it's all excuses with prince Andrew, if it had been one of the public doing what he did, they would have been locked up in jail / []
And just remember he's human just like the rest of us only he gets a get out of jail free card and zero consequences for his actions / []
*The face of a spoiled and abysmally arrogant man who has never done an honest day of work in his life.*  🤦🏻‍♀️ / []
So its a photo and her accusation.But whose the liar here? The ones that say,how come shes coming forward with this? They just want to pity her and despise the accused.But what if her motive is to nail a royal for more money than she got from Epstein and fit him up on a trumped up rape charge? Or if he did rape her he`s making a pitiful denial of it.I dont know which one is the liar. / []
I only knew Epstein through my sex trafficking friend Ghislaine Maxwell , D'oh! / []
He stayed at his house because it's the convenient place to stay? He's a royal. He has access to the Queen's purse. There are plenty of high class hotels in New York City. He could've stayed at anyone of them. I'm sure they'd roll out the red carpet for a senior member of the royal family. / ['Exactly!', 'No man , he just wanted to save tax payers money 😂😂']
Prosecutor: Is she telling the truth? Andrew: I was shot at during the Falklands.  Jury: Not guilty your honour ! / []
Someone stepped on his toe come forward too that night / []
Yes she was away fergie / []
A young girl with dark hair security tooo in photo / []
The interview will prove to be his downfall / []
God he's like cling film see right through him / []
He knew too epestine was out everyday in his office when he got sentence that was a deal he made  he seen him in that time too or phoned / []
Formula one car crash  well don't laugh if serious you popups  arragont man / []
It’s amazing how people can lie so blatantly ! / []
why is he still out and not ben in jail same as his best friend ,   his body language says it all guilty guilty and if he not guilty bring shamima begum back home for justice  coz hers body language is exactly the same as his  guilty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
Prayers for the victims of sex trafficking, may God find justice for the minors abused. The truth will be upheld, God have mercy on the souls of all sinners involved. / ["You're God sucks!"]
She tore him to shreds with minimum effort. This was so kamakaze it makes me think he wanted to get it off his chest / []
A photo of a photo of a photo eh I think you be lying / []
I love looking at people's eyes when they are lying. / []
Lying old toad what gets me the queen is hiding his crimes and paying his legal fees which is paid to her from the taxpayer. / []
When you turn 100 you receive a card from the Queen. When you turn 13 you get a text from Prince Andrew. / []
I really thought at the end when she asked is there anything left unsaid that he was going to say SOMETHING about the victims- but no / []
So you mean to tell me that at no point did he ask Epstein if he was guilty or innocent? At no point did he proceed to berate him about what an atrocious thing it is to solicit minors? / []
A shooting of  a judge  in dc related to Maxwell I bet . / []
He would of seen him when he was allowed out from jail all day everyday Epstein / []
He groses me out, especially when he starts going on about "for men  sex is a positive action" / []
He thought he’d have the upper hand at Buckingham Palace and that it might overwhelm her. How wrong he was. / []
To: BBC & English Patriots. ..I agree, Love Holy Sovereign England forever! As I love the future Holy Sovereign Scotland! It's more productive if Two Free peoples "Choose" to help each other! ...There is no Overlord over anyone! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-xUHtXKyHU / []
The other side’s legal team are having so much fun watching and using this video as evidence wow / []
and julian assange is in jail for telling the truth,,, and this lying shit bag??????? / []
That's Prince Andrew's problem... He's just too damn honourable. Got it. / []
21:41 it's called being a pig. / []
I think The guy who trained this man to speak knew he was a shit head so he didn't train him well to.lie.  wanted him to meet his own karma / []
He's such a shit liar, I bet the Royal PR were shaking their heads in disbelief when this went out. / []
F-in vile. And his own mother the Queen is trying to protect him. Because you can see he's lying. Tell a lie often, it becomes the truth. / []
The long blink at 21:10 is an absolute giveaway. LIAR. / []
“It was a convenient place to stay.” Because I hear being the Queen’s son makes it hard to book hotel rooms. / ['YEEES! I’m shocked more people are saying it. Really, low on funds there PRINCE. No hotel could put you up just for the NOTORIETY?! Where did all the other “dignitaries” stay?! 😬🤦🏽\u200d♀️']
11:20-11:55 is gold / []
The arrogance and the lies. 🤷🏻‍♀️ / []
“I don’t know where the bar is” 😂😂😂 / []
Of course he doesn't sweat he has. BLUE BLOOD get out of jail card / []
Look at all the times his mouth is saying yes but his head is shaking no. Body language inconsistencies. Typically this happens when someone is lying. / []
Prince "What I would describe as" Andrew / []
He seen her a month before arrest / []
He has absolutely denied the allegations. I think it would do him good to go to court and clear his name. Also,the same for Guiffre, that if she has not told the truth,she also has to face the consequences.  If she is telling the truth and he has absolutely denied it,then this interview is excellent for evidence. Also I think she should be questioned why she recruited other girls. / []
From 43'20" to 44'40" he just waffles on about badges and 7-14 year olds involved in something called 'pitch', totally without interruption. Meaningless drivel about some manufactured charity no doubt. Of course Epstein, Gates and the rest of these crooks also claim(ed) to be 'philanthropists'. It's how they get their money which we need to know about, not how they pretend they're giving it away. / []
So when Andrew's advisors asked him if he should do the interview he said: 'Yes, no sweat?' / []
I do believe him but, the camera never lies Andy. / []
Photoshop? Really? / []
Good to know one of the most protected families on the planet are not notified  by other police authorities around the world that someone in their veracity has a warrant out on them / []
This family and country are gross / []
PAINFUL / []
Why do we still have a monarchy when they go to extreme lengths to protect pedophiles ? / []
The mail reports he is considering settling out of court , totally normal to give money to someone you’ve never met then ? / []
Funny his memory is so bad apart from the date he went to pizza express isn’t it 🙄 “the duchess was away” 🤬 does he think we are thick!  Thinks he is above the law, entitled to do whatever he wants 😡 / []
Like a slug squirming away from a puddle of salt.  He’s a disgrace to England and the Royal Family. / []
The royal prince 🤴 is lying his eyelids off. 🤯🤯🤯 / []
If he didn’t ever go upstairs at Maxwells, how did he know it was taken upstairs 🤔 / []
If you don’t remember then you don’t KNOW that it didn’t happen. / []
there is a difference between saying “I don’t remember it” and “It didn’t happen”. “It didn’t happen” suggests some kind of memory, how could you know it categorically didn’t happen if you don’t remember? / []
‘ I can absolutely categorically say this is all lies ‘ eh, em, erm, eh 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ / []
Wow just wow. I am very good at telling when someone is lying and this man is DEFINITELY LYING / []
My 4 year old granddaughter can lie better than him 🤔 / []
Why would you need to go and break up a friendship that you also say wasn’t even a close friendship? More like an aquaintence maybe? its completely normal to just ghost someone who isn’t even in your sphere no need for any formalities. He and Epstiine were definitely in some kind of business. / []
They should've let Chris Hansen do this interview. / []
Telling stupid lies , for dummies / []
He remembers how maxwells house was… but can’t remember taking a photo or meeting her 🤨 / []
Guilty / []
31:36 is quite possibly the funniest and most bizarre answer I’ve ever heard to a sexual allegation. / ['Lol its like he is trying to recall what happened after a xanax bender. If someone asks you a question like that, the answer is either the truth, or “no ma’am, that is a ridiculous and preposterous question and I certainly would remember if I had a sexual encounter as the allegation suggest; and i most certainly can assure you I did not.”\n\nNot “well ive been trying to remember but no i dont remember doing that.” Hahaha', '@cheesescrust5399 exactly. This man is guiiiiilty 😂']
This dude just seems shady. Liar / []
He is a piece of shit that deserves a good stint in jail, if anything that would be a wake up call for people like him born into privilege that they are not above the law like the rest of us / []
I knew this interview was bad, but didn't realize HOW bad. A 5 year old would have an easier time lying. / []
Give this lady a highest royal award / []
If anything I strongly believe Prince Andrew was a pawn in the pairs sex trafficking game. It’s a shame they all thought they were friends, so called friends! Once again I strongly believe he was used quite well and what a better person to use! These people should be ashamed of themselves the reason being what goes around, comes around and they’ll get theirs no doubt and so they should!! / ['What gets me is Epstein threats quite well and he wouldn’t of left Prince Andrew go quite so easily!', 'Are you deluded? I agree it is likely Epstein and Maxwell kept close to Andrew because of his status and power as they did this with numerous people, however it is blatant that he was attempting to cover up the allegations against him with idiotic alibis and that he knows more than what he said!\n\nAlso - referring to ‘these people getting what’s coming to them’ if you have been under a rock that Maxwells been convicted and Epstein “killed himself” so I’m not sure what more you want to see coming to them…']
I love this interview. Lmao! Reminds me of the days when I’d lie to my teachers about reading that assigned chapter for homework that night.. / []
Of all the cringe worthy moments, this one rules them all OOF https://youtu.be/QtBS8COhhhM?t=2210 / []
Fing liar.... / []
I tried to stay for 10 min  with a foot over the other like him... impossible / []
I don't sweat I was at at a pizza hut in Woking but even though epstein was under suspicion I still hanged out with him and i will pay people off to keep things quiet.🤔 / []
How would he know that the photo was taken upstairs if he never went upstairs.  Seemed like a missed opportunity on the interviewer although she crushed him by letting him crush himself / []
This interviewer was excellent, she really kept her focus and cool,. and worded her questions in such a way that Prince Andrew had to give an answer. Her demeanor was so professional, the Prince didn't get his shackles up because of her controlled questioning. / ['Absolutely agree']
people need to ask what kind of shooting weekend / []
Hideously awkward and cringe worthy. / []
"it appears that your hand was around her waist" Impossible.....I didn't have hands at that particular time. "was there a bar at the residence where that photo was taken?" Absolutely not because I don't drink.....but it was up the stairs, two steps to the left, five to the right. "was Epstein your friend" Well our schhhedules wouldn't allow that.........except for the 4 night stay when I ended our friendsh.........uh wait, nevermind" "did you dance at the stated location?" Dance? Can't you see I have a condition that doesn't allow me to sweat, dance, breathe, eat, go to the bathroom, or talk?! "back to the photo, did Epstein take it?" Impossible......because I have NEVER seen Epstein with a camera in all the times we were together getting massage.........uh........food. "but you just said he was not a friend and you barely ever saw him" Damn.......you remembered I said that a few seconds ago?! Lady.....you are really smart.......or maybe I am just a FUCKIN BUFFOON. / []
see her thinking what a bad dirty liar you are / []
I think he is telling the truth. Does anyone know what to feed a unicorn because he wont eat tuna or spam he did eat the bread but he cant live on that alone. The man in the pub that sold me him said that he will eat anything but I think he maybe dishonest. I know that is it normal for the horn to fall off like antlers but should it be hollow I think he may be lacking calcium maybe because he only eats bread. / []
Interviewer did an amazing job / []
omg, this guy is such a lier / []
The women are being heard !    ,   Quite rightly.      What a patronising tosser. / []
😱😱😱😱😱 / []
Watching this again is shocking very good interview . I think he wasn't in tie & suit jacket because maybe they just left the upstairs bedroom  !   Why would they be upstairs in the first place ? So many unanswered questions. / []
Watching this for the second time around. Its comedy gold. Forgotten just how cringeworthy it was. Every sinew in his body speaks Liar. / ["I've never cringed so hard!"]
Imagine his "Royal" says yeah I did F about and it was fun whilst I was an ambasador of this and that. Come on! what was really the point of this interview? To fool himself more? or the BBC? because we the public are not. / []
Epstein’s house was like a train station, there were people in and out constantly yet there’s security everywhere / ['Seems everyone apart from royal protection officers']
Loving the comments on here !!! / []
What struck me was his mention of social media. He actively states that years ago you would just have the printed press to deal with (who are controlled by government and establishment). What these people all need to realise now is that this now works both ways. We are in an age where the truth is quicker to get out due to social media - there is no hiding place for the Elite and the truth will always get out in the end. The globalists and scamdemic perpetrators will hopefully one day be totally exposed (if not already), these people are not as immune from interrogation and prosecution as they think. PROSECUTION takes many forms ! Would love to see Bill Gates face this sort of interview................... / ['Daniel Billington He famously visited the island multiple times and had close ties with Epstein..............and responds in a similar way to Prince Andrew when questioned about it.....enough said', 'Daniel Billington Not sure, but you spelt travelled wrong, I guess you are not as intelligent as gates ?']
Sin stains our thinking.  Sin blocks our decision making. Sin impact our words. Our emotions and affects our will. God Almighty has mercy 🥺 🙏 / []
Spending tax payer money for security , walking in park with pedophile nice , he is stupid or very naive / []
When ghislaine sings like a bird 🐦 which she will. he won't be saved .hopefully .sad world me thinks 🤔 / []
That "unbecoming" comment makes me physically cringe each time I hear it. Emily Maitlis did a fantastic job calling him out on that. / []
Pizza Express Woking / []
Why not use loopholes and abuse of power nowt wrong with that Thatcher used it to abuse children / []
At 5.31 he tries to back track the amount of times he associated with Epstein by just focusing on the United States, it’s a weird way of talking and structuring your sentence, it’s unusual. / ['Daniel Billington yes it is.', 'Daniel Billington yes it is', 'Daniel Billington it is.', 'Daniel Billington yes.', 'Daniel Billington ..........yep.']
This a guy's a POS... just like  Epstein and Trump  They all think riches & power, you can do whatever you want.... and play dumb/deny it / []
Now they all have to wait for another year ? Problems solved! 🤫🤔  Ps, it's legal at 18 years of age ,not 17 ! Wait boys!😂 / []
Alexa, show me a car crash.... / []
What a fabulous interview - she came SO well studied and rehearsed. Excellent prep for this interview - well done. / ["Apparently they had gone over the questions and answers for a couple of days prior to the interview  , which is even worse, that's how she kept a straight face", 'She was good but not great.  There were lots of loose ends and illogical points which he made that she didn’t follow up on. Eg when she asked if he was saying Brockman was lying, he said “well I don’t know mr brockman so I don’t know anything about him”.   The obvious question she should have asked was “why does not knowing him relate to whether you think he is lying or not?   He has claimed X.  You say it didn’t happen.  Either you say he is lying or you say he is mistaken. Which?“', '@jimdevlin1267 really, where is the evidence for your claim?', 'You are kidding right!', '@lm406 no, She didn’t pursue points enough at times.  A lawyer would have done.']
He needs to go to America and face this, hiding behind a convicted perverts' agreement on a clause in that agreement is unbelievable. I don't believe a word he is saying in his defense. And credit to the interviewer for being persistent and focused,  she did a very good job. And I heard it was alleged his daughter set this up? She didn't know this was a bad idea? She must have some regret about it now if it was true she set the interview up... / []
Lots of stuttering too , / []
Man this guy has some terrible memory he has no relocation of anything , one thing he does know though is that he is honourable / ['And he doesn’t sweat, doesn’t drink, doesn’t dance 🤦🏼\u200d♀️🤣🤦🏼\u200d♀️🤣🤦🏼\u200d♀️🤣', 'And that he went to Pizza Express in Woking.']
Imagine if prince Andrew's goes down who else will he take down with him..... / []
I didn't sweat in 2010 but I've overcome that now lol / []
It all started  to defam section of ethnic minorities high lighting the few bad apples by certain political group, but it opened pandora box. / []
His tendencies to be too honourable was what has led him to be the "guest of honour" / []
“It was a convenient place to stay “ The son of the Queen of England dies not have somewhere else to stay ? / []
“It wasn’t a party, it was a straightforward shooting weekend”. Oh how the other half live and the way he’s oblivious to the fact that for most people, that would most certainly be counted as a special occasion (as a party would also be considered a special occasion). *sigh* / []
Why the upward inflection in his voice, sounds like....this one time at band camp. / []
Lol. Prince Andrew doesn't remember his love scene. / []
"With all the scrutiny on me" I thought it best to take you for a walk-in the park lol / []
Coincidentally when we were being photographed.......what a crock of shit / []
Well well, truth will eventually be out, such a shame he has always maintained his friendship with JE was purely down to his relationship with Maxwell.....How’s that going for you now? / []
Epstein was been watched from bigger powers / []
Everything will be ok Your Royal Highness. I know you didn't do what you were accused of.  Virginia Gaffire is a liar.  Jeffrey Epstein paid $500K to Virginia Gaffire to lie and falsely accuse you from sexual assault so Jeffrey Epstein would save his own ass from prison.  You're about to lose everything Your Royal Highness.  Your HRH title for starters followed by your role as the Duke of York. I am a huge fan and follower and supporter od the British Royal Family and  your mother Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth Ii. Both your lovely daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie has just made you and the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson grandparents and the Queen a great grandmother again.  Your Royal Highness you just lost your father His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip just recently and just had your father's funeral plus this tell all Oprah Winfrey interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and on top of that the Royal Family having to deal with a fallout with Harry and Meghan and a new investigation into the late Diana Princess of Wales's BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir.  And on top of everything else after the death of Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh. And now this lawsuit against His Royal Highness the Duke of York Prince Andrew.  The Duke of York is innocent.  This Virginia Gaffire is a liar and Jeffrey Epstein's  500K payoff to Virginia Gaffire to lie and keep the truth quiet is so wrong. The truth will come out in the end it always does and Prince Andrew will be proved innocent and Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Gaffire will get done for sending an innocent man a member of the British Royal Family the Queen and Prince Philip's son down for something he didn't do. What Epstein and Gaffire are doing to the Duke of York is so wrong.  This lawsuit against him and these false accusations of sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexual conduct against the Duke of York is wrong.  He's innocent and soon that will be proved. / []
These Dr.s do not care. Her responsibility is not human life to tbe citizens are. The federal agent, the FBI , usually a woman are hiding in the environment. She should be on trial to explain her goals and mission to the American people. watching Christian bodies to kill them for her God, Allah. Yet, under the quaran looking for hope from the Christian people, its forbidden. The Islamic Arabic helloah leader may decide to kill her for killing as the FBI agent. / []
his family will know if he is truly lying i.e. mannerisms etc, but the language and body language is remarkably betraying / []
If this trial is thrown out, or it goes to trial and he is found innocent. It reflects on ALL of the royal family. / []
He knew John seen him I bet with that acting not face / []
"My judgement was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable"  LOL  ... does he realize what  a lying  pompous ass he is making of himself / []
Poomphus man / []
Popobus man / []
The absolute stuttering of Prince Andrew is a dead giveaway "He must think we are"Fuckin stupid" / []
The pimp was found guilty, now it’s time for the RAPISTS to stand trial!!! Not just this one person…….ALL of them!!! / []
Better to be thought a fool. than to open your mouth and confirm all doubt 🤔 He's like a real life Mr Bean a bumbling fool who has run and hid behind his mum / []
How can a smart woman, like the Queen, raise some stupid men. / []
It's just amazing how much this man can lie. / []
Someone put Prince Andrew in the studio 😂😂😂😂  https://youtu.be/oit3cj7XFd0 / []
I don’t remember where a bar is in a nightclub therefore I am innocent. Nice / []
To sweat or not to sweat that is the question? / []
He did he waved to one goodbye ? At door / []
He would of been with her then then early spring always together?  She was on her own ? ? ? / []
This has all been a massive conspiracy and some of the most powerful people on the planet have got away. We need to keep pushing for answers about who was involved and make sure they are all punished. / ['haha goodluck with that']
Fib took them photos or someone like that in park / []
UK people demand he go over there / []
This reminds me of the press conference Dominic Cummings did in downing st. It’s so far fetched and ridiculous that it just laughs in the faces of ordinary ppl who abide by the law and get held accountable for what they do. This class of ppl do not. And have no conscience about lying through their teeth to your face to try and get away with things. Cus they don’t care or expect to have any repercussions. / []
Ah yes, just a normal shooting weekend. / []
See how he thinks on this with him laughing there discracful / []
Age of consent in Florida 18 and NY 17 / []
Comedy gold 😂 / []
He is guilty as Hell / []
Never good time to talk about your wrong doings. / []
The Tower of London should be his prison and burial. / []
Most if us would forget about a takeaway dimming lol / []
I think the  power the real power took that  photo been folliwed6 / []
That photo is very powerful / []
He probably was scared to go back home after this shit show… / []
It will come out that did did have contact with Maxwell not him in prison / []
See his arrogant way I was there  I was there at dinner / []
I don't know about you but I believe him / []
Makes it a 1000 times worse with him working head of kids charity / []
Like how he says shooting weekend not party lol makes no diffrence / []
Neither wounder the devorce / []
You don't work soooooo have plenty time / []
Emily Maitlis should have won awards for this interview / ['Dont think she will be knighted any time soon though lol', "@jimdevlin1267 deffo not matey.....queen more likely to want her thrown in jail.....Bo no.....there's no Honours list gift for maitless......🤔"]
This was such a painfull interview to watch! He is clearly lieing!!! / []
Old Andy boy has been set up for this fall  for a long time give him a young girl then when ur in trouble just remind him of years ago fool / []
He doesn't have a word of contrition for Epstein's victims. That's the real disgrace of the interview. / []
der alte Spritzer / []
"'The pizza express in woking is a pizza express like no other. The fantastic staff and the dough ball surpassed all my expectations. I had an American hot; everyone else was sweating, but not me.  It was a truly unforgettable experience" Now if you'd excuse me, I have to go to New York for 2 weeks to end my friendship with Galanie, and I can't be late for the party. " / []
Don’t seem to be telling the truth to me …wonder if he is sweating now …..where is he hiding out…who is paying him a salary / []
He’s shady AF / []

The Narcissist Club! Epstein, Maxwell, Prince Andrew etc... / []
_"I'm Bubba_ 👙 _Bill C█████"_ _"and I approve this massage"_   🎷😎👍 / []
Fib I bet got file on him / []
That's his party clothes out / []
Never seen Epstein in my life with camera thought he hardly knew him / []
Without the photo there's enough witnesses / []
reading his body language, I see allot of signs of lies, half truths and witholding information / []
Well his thick skin is evident. If he's lying , someone, something , some form of evidence will trip him over because this will never be over. Surely Andrew knew Epstein had a reputation  and showed it on his own island. ?? / []
Get out of here he would of been told off his people at that time / []
Guilty.  No doubt about  it. If the nutmeg  and hobo still garner royal support snd this piece of crap does not what I that telling you  Now we may have some ide what nutmeg is holding over hobo / []
I bet his sweat glands are working now! Muppet.... / []
They need to find out when he was over in America between 2006 20010 / []
The most bull crap inter view ever in history / []
I would imagine the reason you would travel to see a convicted sex offender in person for several days after his release was to ensure his silence / ['Quote,  I had to go and see him ,i had to go see him, I had to go see him . Of course you did lol', '@jimdevlin1267 Good observation.  What a failure interview.', 'Well put', "He had already been convicted once before; why would you continue to pal with a proven pedophile?   He states its for his 'business' and 'further promoting his good for the people' - and this is after he served 13 months in federal prison for a sexual predator."]
Plus when a guest you don't just see them for two three hours in a week ? / []
Ask wall street when he was there ? Dates they will have them ? / []
Can someone tell me how ghiislane maxwell has a house in belgravia when her father stole the Pergamon press pension fund and afterwards the sons were signing on the benefit office in Oxfordshire. She should be made to sell it and give the money back to the creditors / ["Epstein bankrolled her to a huge extent - talking $30mil, _at least_ : I mean that's a matter of clear financial record. \nThen there's all kinds of other, unclear, spiders-web, money moves, on top of that. I guess digging into it all more was a lower priority than what she's going to jail for."]
Koo Stark… Andrew has always been a naughty prince / []
He does the ''raised inflexion'' making his statements sound like questions. Ridiculous for someone his age - any age. Probably picked it up from his daughters. / ["And/or from all Eptsein's young friends..."]
When I first saw this interview I got caught up with all the mass media / social media hype that he was evasive, improbable and basically self incriminating.  I’m not a great fan of Andrew, but looking at it now with unbiased eyes, I actually believe him. If you look at his responses compared with those you would expect from most people, he does seem to circumspect, hesitant and less than emphatic with his answers, and offers his explanations in a way that would make his lawyer cringe. But when you consider his background it starts to make more sense; he comes from a background which instils a code of honour, and etiquette that is alien to most of us, and I think the impression of reticence and restraint are more indicative of how he communicates in general, ie being careful to choose the right words and maintain a high level of civility to all. His biggest mistake was to go and visit Epstein in person after his conviction, and stay at his house; Andrew is not a complete idiot, if he was he’d never have cut it as a Naval officer, so it’s hard to understand why he felt the need to do that especially if he and Epstein were never close friends anyway, and on,y saw each other a couple of times a year. It’s  not a smoking gun, and could be construed as an exaggerated sense of propriety although at worst it could also have been a mission of damage limitation (the sort of conversation you’d want to have in person outdoors in the park with nobody listening in.) That is the only real red flag I can see, but even that could have been to keep a lid on something more minor that might be used to expose him to false accusations.  A man of his high profile would have to be a complete idiot to take the risk of doing what he is accused of, not once but three times, even if he were so inclined. Not impossible, but highly improbable. When it comes to the actual accusations made against him, there is nothing implausible or disprovable about anything he said; even if the inability to sweat  sounded rather peculiar that doesn’t make it false. On the flip side, there is zero solid evidence to back up the accusations against him, other than a photo of a photo of a photo which could very easily have been edited. Also, if there was any doubt that the accuser might at least be partly motivated by financial gain, the recent revelation of her 500,000 USD out of court settlement with Epstein should at least provide a clue. As I said, I’m not a huge fan of Andrew but on balance I think I believe him on this one. / ['I look at the settlement from Epstein as part of that long tradition of the powerful trying to buy off their victims. That along with the fact that two of the three people she has accused have been found guilty in court in my mind makes her a credible witness. If money was her only motivation I think there would be far easier targets in the Epstein circle to go after.', '@obk1404 Exactly.', '@obk1404 Fair point but if she wasn’t motivated by money, why accept the payment from Epstein rather than seek justice against him in court?', '@justinneill5003 I imagine it would have something to do with the fact that she was up against a billionaire with close relationships with some of the most powerful and influential people on the planet. She may also have witnessed some of these powerful people behaving like Epstein did and so would have seen her case as futile and so accept money to try and get her life back together. The psychological damage of being a victim of sexual abuse is well documented. Look how long it took people abused by the clergy to finally come forward and seek justice and in the interim they still attended church and took moral instruction from the very people who had covered up their abuse.']
He remembers going to Pizza Express in Woking because it was “a very unusual thing to do”. He has no recollection of meeting Virginia Roberts, a young girl, and taking her to Tramp. Go figure. Randy Andy’s lifestyle has caught up with him. / []
"I admit fully that my judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable."  What a royally idiotic priceless moment. / []
What we’re witnessing is a man who has never had to face consequences for his actions being held to account for the first time in his life. And it really shows. / ['I know right!! I was listening to this when it came out at work and was bouncing around the room yelling out what a moron lol ... was very entertaining', '@Ryan-eu3kp \n"I ceased contact with him in 2006 after learning he was under investigation." Interviewer: "You went to stay with him at his New York mansion in 2010." Oops.', '@gregrambo606 looks like that Eton education wasn’t the best investment!', '@Lewis-fd9js Gordonstoun, not Eton. Essentially the same thing but in Scotland', '@sivisvitamparamortem I stand corrected sir!']
Yes you was in falklands but they kept you right out way of any action  Don’t worry mommy’s gonna pay your lawyer s fees isn’t she ! Past come back to haunt you Andrew oh dear / []
He must have plenty of time “in his schedule” these days to do another interview to set the record straight by producing written evidence showing his whereabouts on the key dates. / []
Liar disgraceful / []
when in a hole .... / []
I love the way Emily conducted this interview, she was brilliant!!! She managed to expose PA true nature!! Thank you Emily! 👍👍👍 / []
I describe his house like railway station….. ( it how he trafficked girls ) / []
As it turns out she was worse really then Epstein in her role so it makes it worse for randy / []
Run for cover Andrew, although soon there will be nowhere left to run to. What a brilliant job by the interviewer, always calm. / []
The worse thing about this while Epstein is dead his GF accused and will face jail this Blue Blood will be sued millions that the English public will pay through tax and he will disappear and continue with his pedophilia out of the spot light never to be heard or seen again but hare is hoping he does some sort of prison and even if he did get prison lock him up in London Tower it has being refurbished for him all the luxurys THE 🐷 / []
I love how his defence is 'but I was there/doing it because I was with Ghislaine' ...and she's as bad as Epstein was! / []
If the Queen doesn't disown him, the country will disown her. Which she can't risk. / []
IF U REMNAMBER SOMETHING SHE SUED THE PRINCE BECAUSE SHE NEED MONEY REMAMBER THAT AND ALL THIS IS ABOUT M,ONEY EVEN ALSO ABOUT GISLAINE THEY WANTED HER MONEY THEY LIERS / ['sure, let the abusers get away. if anything the victims deserve the money from all the abuse they put them through']
Extraordinary people? No Andrew, your a pervert mate / []
how has he got away with this / ["He wont. Ghislaine's time is up, he is next"]
Doesn't remember going upstairs in Maxwell's house...but knows that the photo was taken upstairs🤔 / []
Innocent until proven guilty. Yes, I do believe that.  But dammmmmmnnnnnnn son.............. / []
There's so much guilt in his answers, his body language and it's also written all over his face. Also, why would you show so much grace and be "honourable" toward someone who wasn't a "close friend" especially, someone who was a convicted sex offender?!?! Most people would just stop all communication as soon as the news broke and then wish they had never met such a person... The queen is probably wishing she had a miscarriage with this one! / ['Why do u assume the queen cares lmao. She probably is just trying to save face. She too is an old white person I just think she’s smart enough not to broadcast her bigotry. Let’s not forget, it wasnt that long ago that India was a colony', 'If it’s a close friend you might want to confront them and get their perspective on the accusations… but Andy never says that, he literally says he went to cut the relationship off because it would look bad then two staying pals.. that’s it. Honestly his stupidity is astonishing.', "Do you mean the Queen? Why emphasis her colour? As for her bigotry this country opened its doors to all the commonwealth to migrate here giving them home's and jobs in the early 50s making this country the multicultural society it is today but then we have the likes of you,,,", "@lasaaagna I too am an 'old white person' who, since the age of 7, has opposed the monarchy. Do you hate all 'old white people' ? Why be so racist and ageist ? Would you like it if I discriminated against you ?", '@lindajackson5839 I think Amya Kaladeen maybe a troll.']
"Yeah he had the most extraordinary ability to bring paedophiles together" / ['Oh no I got the toys r us UK theme tune now stuck in my head..fecking thanks lol']
Did you know Rrince Andrew thought this interview went well. That's how deluded he is / []
He is telling the truth.   These party girls are lying. / ['sure, victim blaming is the trend today right? the girls deserve it right?']
Ghislaine was Prince Andrew's poodle. / []
It was a shooting weekend not a party, that makes all the difference / []
Just had to watch this again. The lies the lies you can even see it in his demeanour. If this was me I would find ever single bit of evidence to prove this untrue the fact he doesn’t recollect, doesn’t recall blows my mind. I hope his lawyers have been practising cross examining him. / ['It’s almost comical. This man in incredible dumb. Lol']
Kudos to Emily. That she didn’t laugh her head off right there and then is in itself quite an achievement. “I live in … and institution.” Yeah, a mental one. / []
Idk, I reckon he did it, I’ll go out on a limb on that one, call it a hunch / []
If he explained he couldn't sweat because he is a shape shifting lizard probably about 10% of the population would believe him / []
He should be prosecuted / []
No compassion / []
He should not be allowed around young people. / []
Brilliant open question at the end: anything left unsaid that he would like to say? He chooses not to say anything at all that might show  compassion for all the victims. Truly vile. / ['A good way to trumpet your virtue.']
It's like watching a seven year old trying to talk himself out of trouble. / ['Maybe he had some 7 year old friends to learn from.', 'Absolutely! He never was challenged like we all go through', 'Literally. So man contradictory statements in his story.']
So he went to the effort of travelling to Epstein’s house in America, went for a walk in the park with him, and stayed for couple of days. All this for someone he described earlier as a ´plus oné invite and no they werent close friends??  Bollocks.  Also, sex with a minor isnt something you’d forget. All this ‘i have no recollection’ bullshit is proof he is lying.  If that was me Id be like absolutely not, I would not and have never had sex with this girl or any underage girl. There was no conviction whatsoever. / []

13:40 Emily: Another guest was John Brockman, the literary agent, now... Andrew: 😳.....really? Emily: ...he described seeing you there getting a foot massage from a young Russian woman. Did that happen? Andrew: 🤥 No / []
He's only concerned with protecting himself. No concern for the victims. / []
He has zero empathy / []
He doesn't know what someone who was abused was trying to achieve. / []

Joe Biden should organize the Navy SEALS to kidnap him and take him to New York to stand trial. You Brits wouldn't be upset if we did that, would you? / []
It is grotesque.  My question is how did this get published? He clearly doesn't know better or doesn't recollect what normal is. How about the palace and lawyers. They said yep that is great Andy , this will certainly help you! / []
the sweating part at 21:48 and him looking at his handler as he continues to make up the story is gold. / []
in 2009, epstein paid Prince Andrew's accuser 500,000 dollars to protect Prince Andrew. The man is guiltier than guilty. / []
His security people didn't see the photographer in the park.. and they didn't see any underage girls in the house during his 4 day break up party with jeffrey.. very very very suspicious 👀 🤔.. they weren't close friends but he had to go see him in person to break up their so called friendship... / []
Innocent / []
Lieing / []
Yeah she was such a safe interviewer.  Just like American media.  Lmao / []
He  is  a  disgrace........and  should  be  JAILED  !!!! / []

anyone else would of been life'd off , we all know he was have orgy's with underage girls, and we all know that they had him murdered, the firm defoo had epstein wacked 100% / []
Just rewatching this to appreciate the level of professionalism of Emily. She’d ask a question then Andrew would attempt to combat and she lays out the facts just ending him…💀💀😂 / ['Fried him!

People should leave him be the girl is after money money blessings to you prince 🤴 / []
This is the gift that keeps on giving 👌🏽 / []
He looked so relieved when she asks about Epstein's "suicide" because that was the only place he actually hadn't been. / []
This lady is the best in this field. Absolute Markswomen. Hung. / []
There was one time when we all stripped off and sprayed each other with champagne and then we burnt dollar bills in front of a pauper. Oh and then there was a massive orgy. But other than I can't think of anything unusual. That time. / []
"Hi Andrew. Fancy a rubdown?" Is the pope catholic? / []
Who the hell goes for a four-day party as a guess in someone's house to tell them they want to break their relationship... when they are not even close. Thanks for the laughs... if there's any justice in this world he'd be wearing an orange suit like the rest of the people who get convicted for the same kind of things he is allegedly accused of. / []
31:45 that is some deeply repressed, rapey language right there; he is one very damaged human being. 😳🤯 / []
Guilty as sin / []
Guilty son.. / []
Andrew Quote photograph taken upstairs in Ms Maxwell house , How does he know its upstairs in Maxwell House if he was never there / []
26:57... the irony. he's never been upstairs. but knows how upstairs looks / []

Makes it worse with the kids charity / []
No plus one knowing he would be the plus one lol / []
He makes it out that no party shooting weekend makes no diffrence / []
"as guilty as a puppy sitting next to a pile of poo" / []
Should not have any works he has people to get drinks / []
It dose not matter she was there terrrable they be saying poor Maxwell / []
We need to ask the queen on this lol / []
"I have no recollection of ever meeting her...um I'm almost, in fact I'm convinced um that I was never in Tramps with her" / []
An absolute nightmare of interview, Emily was brilliant, Andrew was absolutely unbelievable. / ['Unbelievably bad.... WHO was he trying to impress??']

He is so guilty / []
Stuttering liar bet he does not sleep at night lol / []
49:00 “Free my boy R Kelly” / []
Look at him sweating.... / []
OK let’s do it this way I don’t sweat that’s not my hand around this young woman’s. And I do not know what’s going on at Jeffry, house. But I have been their on several occasions. Yes I did go to his home to break off our friendship but I did stay there for four days. Knowing that Jeffrey was a convicted child rapist but his home was a convenient place to stay. Now The queen didn’t waste no time by removing him from all of his duties his mother knows he’s guilty that’s enough with me. / []
Watch the movie eyes wide shut! / []
Sorry Andrew but photos don't lie ask Clinton for advise. / []
Not once showing sympathy to the victim nor regretting his relationship with Epstein! Shameful. / []
A spineless liar who has brought the royal family into disrepute - Our poor Queen. / []
Embarrassing that Welsh people are ok with having this family of weirdos lord over them. / []
This guys gotten off very lightly / []
"a cosmopolitan group of US [high profile, greedy, powerful] pedophiles" / ['Yes, my question also - who were these groups of high profile people that Epstein gathered????']
Sitting there laughing her a inbarresment too the uk / []
I think it’s plausible to think the reason he didn’t ‘break up’ with Epstein over the phone was fear over it being tapped, and the reason they went for the walk in the park was incase the house was bugged. 🤷🏻‍♀️ / []
Here sits a man guilty / []
I wish they'd sign him up to do more interviews, quality cringe-worthy entertainment. / ['🤣']
This reminds me of Alan partridge and the farmer radio interview / []
In the court room when they play this interview:  Andrew: My team and I cannot be sure that this interview hasn’t been digitally fabricated, I’ve never met that interviewer in my life. / ['😂😂😂', 'It wasent me it was the one armed man on the grassy knoll…..', "Or, I can't recall that at all", 'Good one Abby. 😂', "That can't be me because the person in the interview is sweating ..."]
30:23 Looks like some duper's delight slippin' out there. Good thing he doesn't sweat, or he'd be drenched right now. / []
The damage on my neck due to this collision course of a interview! So no one tried to tell this Prince NOT to do this interview!! Añd WE thought Charles wasn't that bright! 😁 Him and Fergie belong with each other! 🤣 / []
since his suicide…suuuuure mate. / []
What toppings need he have on his pizza.? / []
@15:07 lol. “His suicide”.  Very specific use of words.   Most say “since he died”.   Interesting…. / []
Lock 👏🏻 him 👏🏻 up. / []
12:35, tell us your greatest flaw: “My tencency to be too honorable”… / []
He stammered more than my children do when they know that they are in trouble. / []
I wouldn't believe anything Virginia Dufree/Roberts says. She was a worse enabler than Ghislaine Maxwell. That is why the prosecution couldn't call her as a witness. / ['Is that you Andrew']
Some do some don't treat different why should one / []
Great interview by Emily Maitlis. She insisted on certain questions making sure he would answer them. I again think that he hesitates too much for a person who has nothing to hide. Of course this is speculation but I guess many of us feel that way about him now. I wish the media in my country could interview the ex King of Spain in that kind of manner for different reasons of course but also inappropriate behaviour. Congratulations to Emily Maitlis. / ['Didnt he flee the country?', 'Well, in a way he did, but he wants to come back and it does not seem possible but... unfortunately powerful people get away with murder. Understand the las bit of the comment as a way of saying how the law is different for us "little" people.', "@milly5678899 Yes that's true. I just saw when the whole hunting trip went down he later came back, abdicated and fled. He used to be popular I thought but we dont hear too much about it in America. Theres seperate systems for rich people everywhere."]
THOUGHT he never knew him that mutch to say I've never seen him with camera in life? / []
I've lied a fair bit in my life. Takes one to know one. He is lying. / ['😃']
Andrew: "I throught it was a convenient place to stay", (Epstein's New York estate) to stay" more like a convenient place to get 'laid'. / []
None of this happened I’m not even here / []
Your some thing special  because of the name no your just a man like other men full stop not everyone is going to treat you no different  and this is a perfect example  no exception / []
UK better not be paying for them flights / []
Biggest car crash the world has seen since Diana’s car hit the pillar / []
Ooh this hasn’t aged well. / []
I haven't finished watching the interview, but so far he hesitates too much in my opinion. I will definitely see the whole interview. / []
Guilty as sin / []
I know hes lying you all know hes lying and the interviewer knows hes lying his whole body language tells us hes lying so i guaranty his family especially his daughters will know hes lying / []
Did he seriously say he can’t sweat because of adrenaline? / []
This is after Epstein’s suicide../Insanely, he answers he does NOT regret his whole friendship with Epstein! / []
Bunch of nonces / []
Wu, wuu, wuu buu bbu buu.... Pppp... What was the question. / []
At the time of this interview, only Epstein had been convicted of child prostitution, so here Andrew emphasizes over and over how it was really Ghislaine Maxwell who was his ‘bestie’, and intimate friend…her invitations to the Palaces and personal birthday parties and other Royal family functions more than Epstein! now that Ghislaine herself has been convicted on far more criminal felony accounts of child prostitution, trafficking and more- his strategy as backfired and permanently intimately bound him to Ghislaine and Epstein! He has convicted himself.:: / []
17:20 "Yes I would go stay in his house, but that was because of his girlfriend." In light of Maxwell's recent conviction this retroactively makes this statement even more damning. / ['And his character even more questionable.', 'Is that the gf he is referring to in the beginning?', "@shewasunderwhelmed He's referring to Maxwell, who was Epsteins girlfriend and accomplice. Andrews defence (before Maxwell had been accused of facilitating the ring) was to deflect any close relationship he had with Epstein onto Maxwell."]
Plus one knowing it was him lol / []
Internet can find out any thing as he says so he knew living aboard no excuse can find out in seconds / []
It’s interesting now that GM has been charged looking back and Andrew is using GM as a barrier between him and Epstein. He wasn’t friends with Epstein from this interview but was with GM.  Turns out GM was as bad as Epstein. Go figure. / []
Them body guards should be talked too also in that picture / []
As he says himself there are the internet now etc he knew / []
All these elites/wealthy man are into disgusting things. Politicians and the royal family. There family have been inbreeding for generations yet they live so long. Something doesn’t add up. / []
Emily Maitlis does a fine job with this interview. It will go down in history as one of the greatest PR disasters ever. / []
"It's a picture of me, but not my hand"...."It is impossible for me to sweat, or at least was then, though I'm getting better at sweating?"...How in the world Ms Maitlis maintains her composure is beyond me. I am merely watching this and screaming down the house! Oh! to be a mediocre, lecherous, wealthy white man in this world.  Lie well - or in this case - not well at all -  and the world will still be at your feet. / []
Classic Partridge / []
Get Maxwell's passport to see if she was there spring or in July lol / []

Let the record show that when asked why he would stay at the house of a convicted sex offender, Prince Andrew, Duke of York said: "I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendancy to be too honourable". / []
Shell know things about his body too / []

Oh he is definitely guilty and most definitely got a foot massage from a Russian girl / []
I'm like everybody else but  people act differently around me look because of who I am lololl / []
Get 5he cctv from  the airport fight secudules from them / []
Too many witnesses now / []
I relate to him. I too have turned down invitations to parties I knew were illegal, and  been driven by a desire to be so honorable that after arriving to tell them I couldn't come I'd  go above and beyond and stay anextra few nights just to make them feel special while making it clear to them how sincerely I take my conviction to not participate in the festivities.  Prince Andrew is simultaneously a terrible person yet so perfectly incompetent at trying to claim that he isn't one that you could have the greatest scriptwriters and comedy writers in the world write a scene like this, and it would never be as hilarious. Literally every single affirmation he makes has a perfect contradiction to match usually within the same answer, and a master of comedic timing couldn't replicate it.  I genuinely would be fine if they sentenced him to just do interviews for the rest of his life asking questions about the entire Royal Family and whether he remembers every event or party he's been to. And you could show him pictures of all the people he's met throughout his life just asking if he remembers them while mixing in photoshopped pictures of him with people he's never met or never heard of. He's the villain and the hero of his own life's movie. / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣']
That photo was not taking in public it was taking at your friends house that you've known SINCE kid / []
That photo was taking upstairs he says wh would he know what it looks like then ? / []
The honourable and right thing to do staying at a convicted sex offenders house where there’s young girls in and out yeah right 😂 / []
All your so called Royals, are all a bunch of criminals! Wake up! / []
He go's out like that to party in uk / []
Is this the most arrogant man on the planet,the most hated royal of modern times.theres a lot of people want to see him go to prison,but that will never happen,he thinks he is above the law,and you know what he is above the law protected by powerful people the queen just to mention one. / []
The chomo Prince, living it up in his taxpayer palace. "Bring me more young girls peasants, my unit is urning again" What a freak! / []
Couldn't be me cause that's upstairs an I never went upstairs........(how'd you know its upstairs) / []
Navy and learning has nothing to do with this atall / []
Get her passport to prove she was over in the summer not spring ? / []
Is Andrew going to do the "honourable" thing and stay in Ghislaine's jail cell for a week to break off their friendship? / []
Need to go there / []
Fib knows he done it have file on him / []
Lie dector that's what's needed if he clear he would say I won't lie dector test lol / []
Your a man a man never mind your name / []
Positive for her toooooo / []
How dose he know it's a photo of a photo of a photo silly man / []
Lol lol lol lol / []
Not enough proof papers can be doctored / []
They think we stupid lol / []
He couldn't lie straight in bed, he's such a bad liar, the stuttering in itself gives him away and too many slip ups with his story. I hope Ms Virginia Giuffre kicks his arse in court. / []
A lot of pay offs / []
Should of asked about the wave goodbye to a young girl / []
“Terminal Leave”? Or just Unemployed? / []
It’s a wonder he didn’t fall backwards off his chair from rolling his eyes that far back into his head so many times… / []
Wow - from the very first question his answers sound like a theatrical fairy tale.  Being a bad liar should be a good thing, but this silly egotistical fool seems to think he’s quite a masterful liar. Maybe his privileged life has made him think the world will believe anything he says. At least he’s “honourable” to the extreme, as he claims. / []
I  stayed at his house after he'd done time for nonsing,but that's cause I had to tell him we had to break off our love affair, and a lizard 🦎 can't sweat,and I believe him????? / []
I don’t recall or I don’t remember this happening is a massive sign of guilt as anyone who is sure of their innocence would just say - this didn’t happen. I don’t know how and I don’t know why but this didn’t happen. Saying you don’t remember sounds like you differ from dementia and have no clue as to what you’re doing. / []
For so many years Republicans in Britain have had no voice. We've had to watch all the fawning adoration of the royal family in our toadying press with no chance of reply. We've listened to the BBC read out Clarence House propaganda verbatim. We've watched while they tried to reinvent themselves as environmental champions and mental health ambassadors and whatever else their PR team thought might make them relevant enough to cling onto their position in the 21st century. Now finally this interview has done what we weren't allowed to do with argument. / []
Never complain, never explain, lie at every opportunity / []
Poor guys just too noble / []
This is the best example of dogging your own grave / []
I’ve never been a fan of PA, simply because he always came across as arrogant….BUT, despite being a womaniser, I do think that Epstein and Maxwell USED PA and his Royal connections to bring others into their sordid circle.  Attending parties of Epstein etc does not necessarily mean that he KNEW the names of females there. The Prince of Wales attends parties/galas etc and meets various people but won’t necessarily recall names.  The picture that the media keep showing, shows Virginia Roberts smiling happily with Guislaine also present…VR told PA that she wanted to be photographed with him to show her mother!!!  If PA had slept with this “of legal age” girl without her consent, why is she happy to be seen with him, and quite happy to be so???? PA was a newly divorced man, and VR was (at each alleged meeting) of LEGAL AGE OF CONSENT, so WHY is she suing him NOW ??? She has already attempted to sue two OTHER older men for sexual assault, but it was thrown out of Court for lack of evidence.  Virginia Roberts (now Jeffrey) is living in Australia and no longer an American citizen, so WHY is this case going ahead. She was NOT a minor. / []
Whatever he make excuses , he did wrong things and will not be able to be trusted. / []
Liar! Lol / []
why would he lie? / []
How this man is not charged with pedophilia is absolutely ridiculous …. It’s so obvious this man is guilty. / []
Dude cant remember a girl he's photographed with, but remembers how many times he went to palm beach.  The most convenient memory.... / []
“Straightforward shooting weekend” 😒 / []
Such a bad actor. he's lying through his teeth. my  dog is a better actor. his fake facial expressions.  stutter stutter stutter . what a BAR STEWARD / []
Guilty as f / []
Narcissist / []
Staying at his house? / []
This is so cringe. He is lying through his teeth. / []
It's selfish that he didn't lift his arms up and refill the ocean with the 25 years of built up sweat he released here / []
For a Prince He is not very smart. / []
I'm sick of these privileged class exploiting people and free from consequence. Go to jail. Now. / ['They run the system, he won’t ever see a jail cell']
Who's sweating now? / []
No wonder he does not want to be interviewed by the FBI, this is not a car crash it is a multiple pile up. 😄 / []
Faking it should look at this / []
2022 his jail time 💀 / []
Whatever anybody can think or say, needs to be understood is, Andrews family are the system. It is abit difficult for the system to cancel itself out and appease the commoner.   Andy will be let off and those that he raped will eventually pay him damages for daring to question the event. / []
if this wasn't so tragic, it would be the funniest tv interview i have ever seen. what a total buffoon. lying through his teeth. comes from a family who are supposedly superior to the rest of us simply by being born. utterly gobsmacked. / []
Emily Maitlis is a star, this interview will go down in history, I see a play and film in the future, better than "Nixon - Frost". / []
Maybe  he was high with sometimes 🤔 4 times 👺👺👺 / []
Upstairs where everything 🙄 👀 / []
🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤬🤬 / []
He remember he was home👹👹but he can't remember meeting or taking a picture 😂🤣😂🤣 / []
Isn't it incredible to witness a man becoming the author of his own doom? / []
After all this has blown over, at least he can sweat again. Take the positives when you can. / []
Total shocked at this, I'm no expert but this guy is full of shit. He totally dug his own grave here, his over exaggerated facial expressions and talking crap about irrelevant points are also a huge red flag. Total numnut. / []
This didn’t age well / []
My opinion  guilty guilty and guilty 😔 🤯 / []
I think we can all agree Prince Andy was speaking the truth / []
"A straightforward shooting weekend" Ah well that's ok then ! 😜 / []
This must be one of the greatest foot in mouth interviews of all time. Magnificently cringe worthy masterclass in baffoonery  and implausibility. Death by a 1000 cuts for our entertainment. / []
if he didn't talk so much and tried to defend himself...then maybe he would be a bit more believable...with the interviewer staying silent...made him get further and further into a very big hole... / []
Why he need to go to talk to him did this two man was having affair just maybe 🤯but no I don't believe him🤣😂 / []
He is so guilty / []
For me this man is guilty 😈😈😈 / []
It was so important  to go and stay  again  with a sex offender to break off a friendship that took 4 days a phone  call would have been sufficient he is such a liar he went  back to participate  in the abuse of young girls  sounds more like the truth. / []
Emily performed really well.  Her only mistake was calling him HRH at the end of the interview.  So he knows what Epsteins upstairs looks like but denies going upstairs. 🙄 Same with Tramp nightclub.  Says he’s never been to the bar.  Who else here goes to a nightclub and are oblivious to where the bar and toilets are?  Does he think we’re all complete idiots.  Awful man and brought shame on the UK.  He’ll be found out.  Shame for our Queen in her final years, but nevertheless she raised him. / ['Calling him HRH is probably just a formality, they are in Buckingham palace']
He dug himself  such a big hole he buried himself  he is not the sharpest tool in the box. / []
I still can't believe "his people " agreed to this interview 🤣🤣 / ["They didn't."]
Journalism at its best  Bravo Emily / []
The sweating thing is terrible. Really embarrassing. He was finished after that story. He always be known as sweaty Andrew. / []
Well this aged well / []
I wish the camera was on him at 40:35.  Maitlis: Epstein is dead. Prince Andrew: Yes.   He seems to laugh there which would be a random thing to do. / []
#1 Royal pervert  🤣🤣🤣 Hide your daughters and lockup your sheep, prince Andrew at it again. / []
The reason behind the walk in the park  HE didn't want what was being discuss in person about what had happened  behind closes doors . Being heard by other people  on the phone . The only reason he admitted to  talking to the convicted criminal  because of a photo being produced. Both guilty. / []
The girl in the photo looks hardly distressed & are we saying she could not walk away at any time? I thought Pedophilia was when children of the age of 10 or less were involved? I didn't know 17 year olds were in this bracket...you can get married at 16 in the UK....unless laws have changed. Btw I'm not on these ppl sides but it just seems like a huge scandal too me?     So was she handcuffed & beaten & couldn't walk away at anytime?? Hmmmm / []
So, how many years later do we realise why Fergie quietly divorced him / []
This is a disgrace on the royal family’s name! shame on you Andrew! / []
So he made it clear he was friends with Ghislaine 😂 what's he done! Also how can he know what the upstairs of a house looks like if he has never been upstairs? Jesus. / []
Talk about pants on fire-this dude has an inferno blazing from his ass / []
Guilty AF / []
Nothing much rings true I think he would have done better suggesting she was miss represented as 18 / []
How pretensive! A National Embarrassment! / []
Where are the other or 8 other girls / []
I think he did well. This must have got him off the hook, i guess. / []
most jokes interview BBCs done 😂 / []
7:34 to 9:00 is just disturbing to listen to / []
This looks like  such a Fairytale of the Crown, from Janet Osebaard. / []
Total and utter abuse of power. What a waste of money. Time to abolish the idea of kings, queens and royal families. Useless money pits that do little for moving society forward / []
His face says it all. / []
This guy is a meme😂😂😂😂. / []
No British Royal family member will ever face prosecution / ['You are correct, a major shitshow would need to be implemented beforehand, so that they come out through a backdoor.']
Whenever I did something stupid and can't stop reliving it all over again I watch this video. Instantly makes me feel better. This must be one of the funniest videos YouTube has to offer! / ['Nothing could be greater, a play, a movie, a television show! Can Not Watch enough to remind myself that PAs r everywhere! I feel somehow grateful to be me!', "You like seeing the world's Elite lie to your face and get away with it Scott free? \n\nWhatever rocks your boat.", 'I know right! I was at work kind of half covering my ears bouncing around the room like " WHAT A MORON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOL"', "Daniel Billington Hi Daniel. Just my opinion but I think it's a bit differant as you were already convicted. If you weren't, and all of your friends new about your crimes but chose not to say anything, and some of them participated then yes they should be trialed. Also there are alot of pedofiles out there but they choose not to act on their urge, it is the weak and arrogant slugs that act on their pedofilic urges. Blaming your actions on a psychiatric disorder is a cop-out. \nSorry if I'm a bit mean, I appreciate your honesty and i wish you all the best!", 'Daniel Billington May I ask what it was like in prison?

These rich people feel as gods because of their status and untouchable. Unfortunately for common people are just mentally ill, they don t have any brakes on primordial instincts, they behave like monkeys because that is what they are! They hide behind nobile titles because it s the only nobil thing they have to show. They take the pist and misrespect who works hard, who gain it s life and are honest simple people... they so posh because all this values are unknown to them. They would ruin a person or kid life just for the fun of it. They don t worth a penny, the only good thing they worth is when they die because that day the world and humanity are better. The bad thing is that they can reproduce, are just like rats we can t manege to get rid of these jerks! Close them all in a jail and chuck the keys. Are the cancer of humanity from first to last. Rotten beings! / []
Watching this interview again after the release of the note by Epstein to sign off the 17yrs old girl worth $500.000 ( half a million dollars ) this story has now become bittersweet when prince Andrew has said that he has no recollections of the lady in question. The lawyers representing this lady are now interested in proving that prince Andrew is lying and eventually every other things may follow.  THE YEAR 2022 SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE QUEEN JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS BUT THE FOCUS IS NOW SHIFTING IN THE WRONG DIRECTIONS, HOW MANY MORE TROUBLES CAN HER MAJESTY ABSORB FROM ALL HER STUPID AND OVER-SPOILT PAMPERED GROWN UP CHILDREN WHO DO NOT KNOW THAT THE MONIES THAT THEY SPEND COMES FROM THE SWEAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO PAY TAXES WHILE PRINCE ANDREW IS LYING THAT HE DOES NOT SWEAT.   HOW CONVENIENT!!! / []
I wonder if the inside of a Prison cell would be a convenient place for this grease ball to stay. / []
She made this man squirm. What joy i get to see this unfold. / []
What innocent person on earth needs legal advice prior to testifying their innocence on oath🤔🤔🤔? / []
Prince feels lucky “to actually get a hold of the man” who has just been released from jail for raping. / []
Worked with him in the Fleet Air Arm many years ago. Arrogant then and ultra arrogant now…can’t believe a word he says! If a brick be transparent then so the Prince is a hod’s worth! Disgraceful and the ever present justice department will surely catch up with him eventually..😩 / []
prince Harry was taught well , watching his uncle lie through his teeth / []
It was just a straight forward shooting weekend 😂 / []
What an interesting interview. 🌼 / []
Well, I met Jeffrey through my friend Guislane, but, would be a considerable stretch to say we were close friends, but, He had the Ability to bring Extraordinary People together, to do the honourable thing, RAPE KIDS, ask Guislane, She's about to go through the New Fish routine. / []
He tried his best to look innocent but he looks like a liar in denial. What a sham. / []
He remembers going to a Pizza Express in Woking, and very vividly, yet doesn't remember dancing with a girl in a nightclub and having sex with her. Oh, Andrew, the word liar comes to mind! / []
This is the fourth time I watch it and everytime halfway through the video I am wondering why this guy hasn't been sent to prison yet.His stuttering,his demeanour,his weird memory (not knowing the girl but remembering going out with his daughters at a crucial time) and his explanation why he is not being able to sweat is-  to say the least -strange.He should have kept his mouth shut.He was certainly given the questions in advance to prepare himself for the "interrogation" and given the fact that he as a "prince" (and therefore far above plain commoners like me) ,should be very articulate and maybe even intelligent - he was quite the opposite.Lock him up - the sooner the better. Oh - his ex-wife Sarah ,desperately trying to be re-included in the "high royal society" who is clearly on his side  said "he will win" as if this is a game.Lock them both up..... Thanks to Mr Andrew I learned a new english word( english is not my native language): "unbecoming" So I apologize in advance if my text was unbecoming and full of spelling and grammatical errors 😀 / ["and how many witnesses can he provide from Pizza Express, Woking, from the day a Royal visited for a party?  None.  Zero.  Nada.  Can't even remember the kids the party was for...", "Being a royal doesn't make them more intelligent. What are you talking about? You know these people are normal human beings like u and me? It's just that other humans give them their taxpayer money and put them on a pedal stool. Give them made up titles such as prince and Queen. It's all a load of nonsense. Take a step back and really think. How did kings and queens first exist. A population pick individual and bestow that title on them. They bleed like you, poo and pee like you. Don't ever think others are better than you or more intelligent just because they have money", '@nikkik3263 It was meant to be sarcastic.The whole royal family is a breed of useless people fed by their people.', 'So true. It is unbecoming of any Royal to act like a douche. And along with "unbecoming," another good word for unseemly is "untoward."']

"He (Epstein) was in and out all over the place." Yes he was, mostly in and out of underage girls / []
People are really missing the fact that we are talking about a prince. The son of queen Elizabeth. I find it funny that people think they can decode him. He has a whole team properly a whole secret service team behind him. Who tell him how and what to say . Are u people okay?  Also if he wanted younger girls Epstein is not the only guy in the world who knows young girls. What r u talking about? he can have young girls come to him and do whatever he wants. And non of use will ever find out.he literally say me and my team! My security people m! he is not crazy to make a mistake and leave evidence. / []
Blokes the biggest prick I’ve ever met, ask about his time in the RN? / []

It's interesting how sweaty Andy remembers everything benefitting his side of the story crystal clear but then (conveniently) "has no recollection" of anything that makes him look bad... / []

Very unbecoming interview. He's guilty. Of course he is. / []
HEADLINE NEWS Recently widowed Elizabeth Windsor aged 95, has been arrested for harbouring her 61 year old sex-offender son Andrew from Justice.  Elizabeth, who lives in a government owned house, refused to confirm whether she knew the whereabouts of her son.    Andrew’s on-off girlfriend Jizzlane Maxwell, has recently been convicted of trafficking underage girls for sex........ / []
Lie after lie after lie , shame on you / []
Why is it when these idiots get caught out ...oh damaged control ... Jeffery didn’t commit suicide he was  killed as he knew to much on all these elites and had evidence to prove it,hence the reason he is dead. And Andrew knows it ,he more than likely danced when he heard about his death as they all have skeletons to hide... And the dribble that’s coming out now is proof of this / []
There's no way they will let this dude go to jail, the woman will get the money she's looking for and the dude will hide from the flashes in shame while he enjoys a luxurious lifestyle thanks to taxpayers money until he dies. / []

that's why jimmy new he was untouchable he new about big profile people one big cover and why nothing was done until he was dead  up rot in hell / []
He doesn’t remember sleeping with Virginia coz he has slept with a lot of underage girls in his life.I totally understand why he has no recollection of meeting her.He also accepts he is the one in the photo but not sure the hand is his 🤔🤔.He sounded like a 2 yr old when he said he’d gone to break friendship physically 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️.Credit goes to the interviewer / []
Why Andrew can recognise Maxwell's upstair, he insisted he never been upstairs in the Photo? / []
Train crash / []

This guy is lying thru his rich teeth 😂 / []
He's going to get trafficked in prison. Ouch!!! / []

Going to Pizza express hahaha! Why would you remember that 🤣🤣 ffs. The man is lying. / []
14.13 !!! Nooooooo (to the foot massage question) / []
Bloody hell.......he is guilty as it gets.....the responses are unbelievable! / []
The only thing I'll say is that there is currently no evidence against Prince Andrew.  I'm not saying he did or didn't do it, but at this stage it's one persons word against another.  You are still innocent until proven guilty in this country and it's vital that this principle remains, regardless of whether we think they are lying or not.   This is a masterful interview though and he doesn't come out of it well. / []
GUILTY! / []
Scum bag whose  privilege has helped escaped justice and who he think is  above the common person / []
He doesn’t regret meeting Epstein his minor plug / []
He's lying his a$$ off! / []
This shows how stupid racism is! The royals are so worried about Megan meanwhile they are protecting this predator while worried about the color of their kins skin smh. This man still has his title but his nephew doesn’t cause marrying a black woman is a bigger crime. / []
i believe him i don’t know about you guys / []
This is one of the greatest interviews of all time, the way he just digs himself further into a hole as it becomes so obvious that he is also involved with Epstein’s sexual trafficking of minors / []

From duke to a puke, Hiding behind big mummy,  Photos and more revelations by victim don't lie, he's guilty alright, don't sweat he said, I bet that he will be now, ... / []
There is only so much you can do when an adult refuses to accept the fact that you know he is lying.  She tries the socratic method, of helping him realize through a series of logical questions that he is indeed lying.  The situation would be far simpler if he was a child.  Then you could just tell him, "I know you are lying". / []
The Grand old Duke of Enabling.....not the Duke of York !!! / []
I ask this?......................  Why would you take a trip ALL THE WAY TO NEW YORK to break up a friendship with a suspected sex offender knowing that there was a volume of evidence accrued to SUPPORT truth of such allegations? Why wouldn't he have just cut the friendship off at it's stump (just ended his connection immediately)?  His only indication of regret was that of "Letting down the royal family'' by NEGLECTING TO UPHOLD their high standards/REPUTATION? How about PITY FOR THE VICTIMS of ALLEGED ABUSE? In fact ....why wouldn't DISGUST AT SUCH ABHORRENT BEHAVIOUR have repulsed him enough to never associate with Epstein and his 'so called friend' Ghislaine Maxwell ever again? I'm not buying any of his rubbish!!! Bring on the evidence against him. BRING. IT. ON. !!! / []
Flies over to tell him we can't be seen together while walking in a public park / ['"I came to see you, to tell you I can\'t see you anymore"\n\nIt\'s honestly laughable he thought that could slide']
Best protection against a lawsuit for a single man is to have sex with a sex doll and not with a call girl. Virginia, the call girl received thousands of dollars from Jeffrey and Prince Andrew every time she had sex with them because one was a billionaire and the other one was a royalty.  After that Virginia received millions of dollars from settlements of civil lawsuits against Epstein estate, and now she hopes to get some more millions from settlement of civil lawsuit against Prince Andrew estate.  So many millions of dollars for what ?  For sex ?  All single men agree with me;  the best protection against lawsuit is to buy a sex doll. / []
Says a lot about the quality of security detail surrounding the royal family. / []
“I’m too honourable - I wanted to break it off with him face-to-face.”  Dude, he wasn’t your girlfriend !!  He goes from describing him as a plus-one and friend of a friend, to being angst-ridden about ending their relationship.  He’s a Prince with his own staff who could have arranged to send Epstein a letter on HRH’s gilded asswipe paper! He apparently never read a newspaper and didn’t know what was going on. He said the walk in the park was when they had the break up conversation, but then stayed at his house for a few days after !  I’m sure one can get one’s butler to arrange for oneself and one’s luggage to be transferred to a hotel of repute rather than stay another moment in the company of a sex offender.  Ghislaine knows a great Jail BnB and will never have to pay for accommodation again! / ['He wanted one last fiddle with him']
This has David Brent comedy written all over it / []
She also should have asked . Tell me this with out grinning . / []
GOD ! Just looking at that guy and watching him lie like that just makes me want to throw up .  What a sick and evil vile minded pervert .  The sad and sick thing is that there wont be one person do anything about it .  The poor children that went threw this . That is who suffered the worst . Not one person to protect them . That is sick . Our US government knew this for 30 years and did nothing to save the children .  They are just as guilty also just because they turn their heads and never told any of us .  I remember back when there was a group of senators went to Israel and partied in this party they went skinny dipping where Christ had walked on the water .  One short news cast was made about it and that was cut off . Nothing was ever said about it and nothing was done . It was hushed up .  This will be the same . NO Justice will ever become of this .  HO just one and they hanged Jeffrey Epstein . That was not for justice that was to shut him up , wife up and anyone else . I also know that this high cult these people belong to would take a female child and sacrifice her to death . They rape her first then torment her before she would die . This political cult is here in the USA . This cult goes way back into the beginning of this nation . It is a devil worshiping cult for only top members for the government cabinet and a handful of vary rich people . Some of them are people like the Rockefeller's , Rothchild's ,   Jeffrey Epstein of the day , Clinton's , Both Bushes , and  on and on . These people made their deal with Satin and made their deal with GOD both . They think they have a plan before they die . They will get a high Priest to ask GOD to save them and the priest will  tell them that they are saved . This priest will be of a Catholic religion . Always will be .  It is their faith that can save them . This is because the in the Catholic religion that only a priest can talk to GOD . The most worthy .  With that said that these vile evil people think they will be saved from hell when in fact GOD will not save them . These people will end up in hell . / []

About as convincing as my cat when she pretends she hasn’t shat on my shoes / []
Put his foot in it so many times. Paused to many times to think of a right answer then contradicted himself. You can fool yourself but you cant fool us. / []
No no no ,Never Never,  Prince is Right & was Right , 😍😍😍 / []
Omg WOW. I forgot it was any where close to this bad lmao. 🤣🤣🤣 I knew the sweat part was bad but this is crazy...the entire interview is just so horribly bad for him. That's what u deserve prince pervert. / []
I didn't watch when it first aired. However, I was taken back when GM trial ended and found guilty. I have literally watched 4x straight in pure awe how bad he did on this interview. Tell me your guilty without telling your guilty. The interviewer award this chef's interview etc. / ["Yep absolutely. Sort of wonder if he wasn't behind the very suspicious death of Epstein.", 'Welcome because its only going to get better!', '@mnikcd123 sure hope so!  NASTY PIGS NEED TO PAY!  FINALLY FINALLY A LIGHT IS SHINED ON THESE DISGUSTING PIGS!  OH I HOPE JUSTICE PREVAILS!', 'I know right! I was listening to this at work and was bouncing around the room like ."WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, WHAT A MORON LOL" was soooo bad lol', '@liamlewis2084 had me thinking the same!!']
13:20, for someone who needs his own security, he now describes the house to continually have unknown persons coming and going ‘like a railway station’ . That’s complete boll$$ks and security should have stopped any such situation. To be fair, complete boll$$ks sums up every word that came out of his mouth. / []
To describe Epstein’s behaviour, as a convicted sex offender, as unbecoming… what a pompous, arrogant and obnoxious idiot.  He’s a member of our royal family, but we honestly don’t want him anywhere near our country / []
Watching the worm still squirming. / []
You lying fiend! / []
Un politicians ect all doing the same things / []
He should go to prison, as did Epstein and Maxwell and as well as anyone else who has been or is to be identified as a perpetrator should too. / []
"it would be incompatible to be seen with you".. instead of 'Youre a fkin disgusting convicted sex offender. I dont want anything to do with you' 😳🤨🙄🤔 / []
They should just play this to the jury if he gets dragged into court / ['Hahaahahaha the Queen would NEVER allow that.', 'Probably not']
He did it. I don't believe a word coming out of his mouth / []
It's so obviously he was involved!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
Was this a honey trap : Dodgy money,Dodgy associates. Black mail, subdifuse. It's convoluted with very rich, influential and powerfull people involved. / []
It. Was. A. Convenient. Place. To. Stay. / []

He'll fix it / []
Jimmy Saville buddy / []
He is such a pompous arse / []
Brits will get online and try to lambast their American cousins while a living symbol of their country is a child predator. Yanks and Brits have to come together against these sick people. / []
Watch the movie " The Bank Job" And you'll see if prince Andrew is as innocent as he pretends to be . Nasty sob / []
Funny that , I was genuinely wondering about  his IQ. He really doesn't appear to be wired up right / []
most videos have comments turned off... this one doesn't hmmmm / []
This would be comedy gold if not so serious, it would be fantastic to see him in prison. / []
Prince Andrew is a creep. He sounds so guilty / []
Watched this at the time and now again, days after the conviction of GM. So many questions that he still needs to face and answer in a court. / []
this prick is going to prison for his crimes. he is not above the law / []
The photograph was taken upstairs but I never went upstairs...What?..That makes no sense. / []
Seriously?  With all the power and money, he couldn't get better advice?  Like DON"T do this interview.  That being said, glad he did.  He he...so he had to go to NYC to break up with his boyfriend in person...OMG...too funny😄  Let Justice roll down...... / ["He probably did have the best advice and advice not to do it but he's so arrogant he ignored it"]
The body language says it all. Did Andrew just say Jeffrey wasn't into partying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / ["No Jeffrey  was not into  partying but into sexually  abusing  young girls there's  a big difference.", 'Stripped  of all his military  affiliations  and can no longer  use HRH l think he is now Mr.Winsor']
The sense of incredulity in those eyebrows says it all really. He's one lying toad!!! / []
Let's just hope that trumpy pants aka the 3rd antichrist and his fools are dealt with soon / []
bs 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ this guy is a comedian / []
Wow. Reminds you of the politician scene off little Britain where he tells the press he was looking for a Murray mint and slipped and a part of his body ended up in the other man’s body / []
He wasn’t a close friend but you stayed at his residence lol bye Andrew / []
Liar liar pants on fire. / []
Sorry,  not sorry,  but the "Royal " Family is rotten.  This guy is guilty and look at how they treated Megan Markle . No class !! / []
I think he’s lying just like Clinton, Trump and all the others! / []
Lie, lies & more lies! / []
Up his own ….e Imagine taking orders from him in the navy 🤥🤥 / []
"my judgement is coloured by my tendency to be too honourable" ...lol...what a pompous buffoon.. / []
Violeur ....menteur...... / []
Of all the luxury hotels in New York that the Prince of England could have stayed in, the house of a convicted pedophile was the most convenient. Of course, but most convenient for doing what? What service is it that the Ritz or Waldorf or Four Seasons dont provide? I guess he is honest there as there was something made convenient for him that the other places did not have. / []
22:00 Oh the things that poor princes have to do to be able to sweat like the rest of us! So hard. / []
He'll never end up in prison. Such a joke.. / []
£250,000 a year from his old lady’s coffer’s plus £400,000  expenses and £300,000 24 hour security, that’s another example of being thick skinned. / []
His mannerisms are very telling if you go by the human perception of gut instinct. The indignation on display and his attempts to distance himself are almost childlike in their earnestness. Any parent knows when their child is being evasive or lying but in this case we are all parents. It's actually quite sickening to watch whilst knowing this a member of the Royal family, someone who's entitlement and privilege have shielded him from responsibility and close scrutiny all his life. Also apparent is his disdain for others and his assuredness in thinking that he is believable simply because of his status. As someone that has had to question many people in my life to get to the truth this reeks of dishonesty. Deflection of certain points and emphasis on inconsequential details is a giveaway. / ['watches one JCS video*', 'Funny how he though it would be a good idea, if he kept quiet things would only be half as bad as they are now.', 'Agreed! In fact their status disqualifies them from being considered trustworthy -let alone their out of touch blindness.', "regardless,\n\n anyone being questioned on a matter this serious would be squirming whether guilty or innocent, we don't know if he's lying or telling the truth, we can only speculate, I'm willing to follow where the known fact lead, but they don't lead anywhere as of yet because we don't know all or enough of the facts, to make an indisputable judgment.\n\nas it stands we can only follow our fundamental values of the legal system and go innocent until proven guilty. \n\nWe need more information.", "@theant9821 it's obvious he's guilty cause he's saying he can't remember her at all as though he wants to completely distance himself from Virginia, which doesn't make sense when there's a photo of him with her at Maxwell's London home.\nHe wouldn't need to lie if it was just a harmless photo and nothing untoward took place.\nIf he said he met her but nothing bad happened and it was just her way to exploit him then we (the public). would never know for sure."]
Take a drink every time Andrew says "funnily enough"! / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣']
the truth is revealing itself very slowly.. won't be long now till everyone gets found out and there will be riots / []
#shelteredroyals This interview was so painful to watch.  Happy new year everyone #2022 / []
"Unbecoming? He was a sex offender." / []
Again I love her. A manner unbecoming? He was a registered sex offender. Response: I was being polite.  I love elitist pretension especially in these cases. One ounce is worth a pound of manure. / []
Andrew: It was taken upstairs in the house so it was not me! Interviewer: How do you what the upstairs looks like, if you never went upstairs in the house? Andrew: Can I phone a friend? / ['Ha, very funny .', 'Lol']
The royal family is corrupt and evil. / []
I'm sorry. He had plausible deniability until that," I went to his house after he was released to let him know it was inappropriate to be seen together" and a public walk in the park and then stays in the convicted sex offenders house. Oh my dear I hope the Queen had someone take off their slipper & swat the back of your head on that one. Geeesh. How stupid you must think the world. Kudos to the interviewer. Even respectful tone throughout but kept the press at every instant. Man I miss true journalism. No barking accusations or simpering platitudes of support. The simple facts in a calm respectful tone. " at the home of a convicted sex offender?" ...Honorable and right? The father of 2 daughters found to honor Epstein's dissolution of friendship over the. Victimization of girls.  Like his daughters. Oh not his daughters so ok? Hmm / []
This is a man that has never seen real life, always mollycoddled in a cocoon within which he thinks he is the center of the Universe and the rest of us Plebians are dumb asses that say ay ay sir all the time.  To be fair he can't be blamed though, his genes come from an ancestry that have regularly beheaded people if they didnt like their hair cuts.  All hail the Queen (and her pe do son).   In a different world this moron could have become King and ruled the "British empire on which the sun never sets". Then he could have had a different child for morning, afternoon and evening pervy sessions as his glorious ancestors of the Tudor family did. / []
Love how he says he can't have bought her a drink in Tramps because he doesn't know where the bar is !!!....like it's impossible to find a bar in a club !!!....why is he still walking around free ? / ["In a place like Tramps its obvious  the waiter would come to the customer  and just because  someone  doesn't  drink it is not a reason not to buy for others  he is such an arrogant  idiot  he reaps what  he sews its come back to bitr his arse.", '@suneernoronha321 it was a rhetorical question']
lol so in 2006 u tell him no contact then 4 years pass and u decide to go tell him again but this time face to face okayyyy 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ / []
18:52 same energy as “I did not have sexual relations with this woman” / []
PRINCE Andrew  represents the true world and sometimes , though very rare even the Elite can paint themselves into a corner! / []
Jeffrey Epstein case[edit] In 2008, U.S. attorney Acosta approved a federal non-prosecution agreement[2] with Jeffrey Epstein. That secret agreement, conducted without consulting the victims, was later ruled illegal by a federal judge for violating the Crime Victims' Rights Act.[25] / []
"Telling him I couldn't see him over phone was the chickens way of doing it. I had to go see him", 🤣, to tell him to shut his mouth about me.. / ['And get some underage nookie']
I am so disgusted by this man and by the royal family for trying to cover him. Gross / []
This kind of individuals wont do anything before talking to a council. He just wanted to speak with Epistane not on a wired media in 2010. / []
Rewatching after the guilty verdict and the amount of times he literally threw Ghislaine under the bus it’s not even funny. Also, the absolute nonsense he is spewing is nuts. / []
It was a small dinner party because most of them thought fuck me I ain't going near that pedo, but 8 did, as they was the same as him, think the only female there was Galiene / []

If this was a police interrogation they'd be laughing their heads off at this COMICAL "performance". / ['this reminds me of the saying "The poor are interrogated, the rich are interviewed."', '@minty6891 Spot on. With the criminals "Knighted".']
Can’t cling onto the Ghislaine card anymore now that she’s convicted huh? / []
Talk about the crimes against Julian Assange ! / []
Why you decided to talk about the buckets of sweatings??? Your sweatings like a rain🤣 / []
A person is innocent until proved guilty....let the truth out...THEN condemn  . abjure media speculation....it exists to sell papers as it were... / ['As powerful as royal family , they wont get  near a court ,let alone get him in trial. And you know it too. So how to prove guilty']
Most guys have banged a few slags in their time.  He should have rattled her in Balmoral because the legal age for flinging it up them is 16 in Scotland / []
He is the worst liar ever!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH / []
america should put its own house in order before attacking british royalty...... / []
This 2022 is going to be fun.Clash of clashes indeed. / []
He would "love" to be able to answer more pertinent question if he could....  He considers his alleged behavior is not damaging to his mother, the Queen or the institution.  How can he say such a thing when this case, so far, has been the most destructive action to his family in generations? Far worse than  Uncle David and his Nazi Germany visits & abdication in my view.   One wonders what behavior or incident would reflect badly on the elderly Queen ?    To be fair Diana specially after her divorce was not paragon of virtue. By that I mean having a series of affairs with married men, causing at least only marriage to collapse and even making well published harassing phone calls.  Even one Metropolitan Police protection Officer committed suicide under questionable circumstances.   Unlike Andrew because she was appreciated mostly by the media and public there was never any investigation into her clearly  possible criminal conduct.  No surprise there .   Frankly, all this (Margaret, Ferguson, Armstrong-Jones, Mountbatten even Charles and his Dad) leaves one to the conclusion this rather expensive indulged family is" off the rails " and on a quick downward spiral.    No wonder they are very "low profile" these days with only lot's of photos of Kate playing the piano etc.     As of to day the good no nonsense NY Judge has ruled the civil case must proceed with an "interesting " exchange of documents (Discovery in legal speak) and according to the Guardian newspaper to day it is said that the Plaintiff's team has found 6 people who can tie HRH with the Plaintiff  Roberts and he had produced no evidence as to his then problem of not being able to "perspire."  My mother told me use of "sweat" was common lol The Guardian are now raising the strong possibility of an out of Court settlement and also the potential difficulty enforcing any Judgment as the Defendant is out of the Jurisdiction and or well placed 'for now) in society.  If I was the Plaintiff's lawyers I would apply to the Court as a condition of the Defendant being allowed to continue his defence that he deposits in cash, say,  for starters $ 4 million. (this would be for any damages and Plaintiff's costs which are huge)    This is a common procedure in English civil litigation and good practice in such "tricky" cases. Guess the accountants in the back first floor smokey office at  Windsor castle this morning are wondering who actually may have to pay substantial damages apart from the British taxpayer.... / []
The self-gratifying comments in this thread are laughable! There's absolutely nothing on York and that plaintiff and her lawyers have got nothing! This is a hustle! / []
The plaintiff and her lawyers have got nothing on York... this entire episode is horseshit! / []
A marvellous example of journalism at its very best / []
Strange Maitlis cannot pronounce the name Ghislane correctly and makes it sound almost another name.   I find it odd that HRH (for the moment) always refers to her as "his girlfriend" as if he would he ill if he actually referred to her as Ghislane.  After all they were best buddies since university.  I smile also his frequent use of WE.  Why did she not pry more into who were the "WE"?  Interestingly he confirmed he has a "security team"  at the time in question.  Whether in Belgravia mews house somehow doubt but why have not his former "team" been interviewed about his jaunt to the famous Pizza Restaurant, Tramps nightclub etc ? Another convenient omission which the media has not persued. Why not ?? / []
Comedy gold! Utterly hilarious but also so depressing….. / []
Denying all Knowledge trying to say the photo was faked "I don't ever remember that photo being taken". His next words.."That photo WAS TAKEN upstairs" 😳 😬 / ['he can recall it from the things in the house... if you take a picture upstairs and forget you took a picture and you see it after 20years, you can remember how upstairs looked.', "@Ciiipp He also denied ever going upstairs..even though he stayed there regularly. Watch the interview again I've never seen so many blatant and obvious lies in my life!", "More over he can recall it because he's in it!! Even the FBI couldn't refute the picture was real."]
Public displays of affection is not something I do 🕺🏼 / []
Creep. From a long line of creeps. / []
No denial to any of the questions……. / []
He's lying like a ten year old boy 😂 / []
He doesn't (seem to) realize that Epstein's "extraordinary ability to bring people together" were the girls that they all knew will be provided with at the end of the day. You really think they wanted to discuss with Epstein the Iran-Israel conflict? / []
How does he know that the photo was taken upstairs if he never been there ? 😂 / []
Is it not significant that Du Frey didn't look in the least emotionally repressed in that photo. She looked at ease and i would imagine that most 16 - 18 year old girls would drop their knickers immediately to a bona fide Prince. And now that Ghislaine is guilty, the REAL MOTIVE manifests itself...... MONEY. That's what this is all about. Epstein and Maxwell had too much and their associates didn't get enough. Its as simple as that. / []
As soon as he said he didn’t sweat at the time swat should’ve came in and body slammed him 😂😂😂 / []
Now look let’s take the positives from all this, after the Queens funds and the private estate of Lancaster have been exhausted. He’ll get his sweat glands back! Yeah!. / []
its crazy how prince Andrews dad had a photograph taken of him Caught red handed to when he was younger!! / []
I can "CATEGORICALLY" bet your ass he is lieing!!!! / []
He sounds just like BORIS speaking on covid / []
Watching this again after the Maxwell verdict. This reporter is conducting a masterclass on how to allow a stupid, overly privileged, mediocre, lying man dictate his own fate. 👏👏👏 / []
Well girlfriend is worse than he / []
He should have married that little Virginia giuffre and take her out of there she's beautiful / []
He wasn't a close friend but after he got out of jail you felt you needed to go see him in person to talk. If y'all weren't that close why did you care to even go see him???? But yet you have stayed at all his houses even his plane??? Dude is a liar, and the whole royal family are all nazis, except Diana and her children!!! / []
Well that's painful to watch-P.S. Get some new advisors / []
Who the heck remembers the exact date of his kid’s pizza party 20 years ago? / ["Like honestly ???. Any person can hardly remember what they've done last week on a specific date and time....but over 20 years , that's a complete cobble.", 'Well it was a birthday party for underage girls so who knows lol']
This is so very embarrassing for our Royals. You really don’t have to be a body language expert to work out this man is talking absolute nonsense. / ['Yep proves most of them are thick 😂', 'She copies everything I do.', 'This is nothing compared to the other things they have done', 'IM SO DIGGIN THE EYEBROW DROOP..LOL', "They are not *'our'* royals. They are sure as shit nothing to do with me or anything even remotely related to why I like being British. 'Our'? No."]
The Prince is full of shit, where is the royal jail?  That’s where he should be. Let the Party begin / []
He should have married that little girl Virginia she's beautiful that's his Los / []
29:55 he about to cry from the fact he can’t hide his lies lmao / []
This man is beyond disgusting. 🤢🤮 / []
What a royal mess *&%$#@ / []
She dragged it all out of him,in his own words. / []
Absolutely repulsive, the sheer arrogance is really saddening. / []
Lies, lies, lies from beginning to end. / []
Stuttering like crazy… all those visits… all those foot massages, pictures… parties… that’s a stark way of putting it- the truth us. Wow. Stutter… clearly he’s a mess / []
Hipocrit Liar / []
43:35 telling you about his role just listen its just so facts hidden behind truths / []
A snake 🐍 in the grass 🤣 That's not my hand around her waist Selective memory, he must believe in his own lies Randy Andy stuck his stick in candy, and will now pay dandy 🤣 / []
Bet your sweating now Andrew  Noose  is getting tighter  🤣🤣 / []
What is it a defect from all of his family's incest? / []
The comments are comedy gold -  I’m dying 🤣 / []
2:47 "after I got married I was very happy" said while shaking his head furiously / []
I bet he’s sorry he decided to be interviewed now. Hahaha he just dug his own grave / []
If I was famous and wanted to make sure someone knew I didn't think we should be seen together, the first thing I would do is go and spend time with them in person. Because, you know...that's the bravest thing to do. Logic  Edit: why on earth would you need a lengthy conversation to say why you couldn't see him. You're a Prince and he's a convicted sex offender. Surely if you'd never spoken to him again he'd probably understand why?  Edit Edit: he's never been upstairs in the house but can definitely say the photo is of the upstairs of the house. How? I wish Emily had asked him that / []
He is such a liar / []
Andrew tell  the truth and get clean. / []
Prince Andrew should sit for an interview with the FBI not the BBC.  Even with the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell this week, the efforts to hold Epstein’s influential enablers and accomplices accountable to justice must continue. / []
His non verbal behaviour says everything . I don’t think he can ever sleep tight 😴 / []
He is in so much trouble. / []
Bet your sweating now. / ['Hahahahah I am creased reading this comment 🤣 😂 😅 100%agree']
So guilty unbelievable but this is how the privilege get away with it so much money and power / []
Who's here after his best friend Maxwell was found guilty? / []
Odious man who believes he is above the law. We will see about that. / []
The many many contradictions… 🤨 / []
Prince Andrew is a nice man. The Media in America or in the UK will try to destroy any person guilty or innocent The Media's job isn't justice, it is to entertain. She uses different tones in her voice asking different questions--she is well trained / ['@NoobScAlp Like I said guilt by association and a person found guilty even before a trial. Finding a person guilty before a trial especially by the Media is a dangerous thing. You are just being a sheep.']
The most skillful actor would envy such п rich facial expressions. / []
did  he just laugh when she said " Epstein is dead" .....40:40 / []
Blimey, she had him on ropes. The man’s a complete weasel. / []
MY security people, my staff, my people, what a creep.  Give him a few shifts working at McDonalds, without his staff, his security, and see how he gets on then.  Just remember, us English taxpayers keep this lot. / ['..my sentence']
What a disaster!!!!  He never should have granted the interview because he dug his own grave. / []
He's not a very good liar. / []
‘I didn’t sweat at the time’ WTF 😂😂😂 / []
remember what happened to robert maxwell?  for those less un-educated - threw himself off a boat...scandals followed, but defending the indefesible? i mean, in days gone by.. / []
time to tell the truth, to those honest taxpayers / []
nothing to hide, so say what u saw? implicated with `i dont sweat `,  nothing to hide? not my arms around her? - really? the fall of the maxwell empire - and fergie didnt do that toe...i mean come on, honesty is the best policy. / []
Billy liar and he also finds it amusing that epstein is dead. Everytime its mentioned  he has a little giggle. Sicko / []
finally seeing the interview, amazing how destroyed himself within 10 minutes of interview, its like watching a car crash in slow motion. The interviewer is brillant, she just quietly buries him. Amazing job. / ['True.. she just elicits him digging his own grave.']
He's such an honourable and honest man, innocently charged, it should be no problem for him to take a lie detector test and to do a 10 min run on a treadmill in front of a judge to prove he doesn't sweat.... / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣', 'He claims he can now', '@lindaarrington9397 He still plays dumb....', 'He (s)electively did not sweat in the specific timeframe. LOLz']
He doesn't sweat, he doesn't dance, he doesn't party, he doesn't go to bars, he doesn't go to pizza hut, he doesn't hold parties for child sex traffickers, he's only "honourable". Either this man is a complete narcissist or he has a body double running rampant in the palace. / ["Maybe he does.. but he doesn't remember either."]
he's a bad liar. he was in new york in panic trying to assure epstein would not disclose him buying trafficking victims. but epstein filmed everyone.... 24/7/365. he will be on tape somewhere. / []
Convenient place to stay😂 like Jimmy Saviles air b n b or Glitters timeshare / []
44:43 What? / []
Andrew must be dealt with and put in prison, the royal family have got away with too much for too long. / []
The BBC interview didn’t take place I have no recollection besides I have a medical condition which means I can’t do interviews / []
It was at this time @36:53 he knew he fucked up / []
Possibly the best hour of television of the last decade. Watching it back again, he justifies his relationship with Epstein as a plus one of his close relationship with Maxwell. That house of cards is now in a heap on the ground. / []
This guy is lying through his teeth…he needs to go to jail / []
When you feel depressed just watch this one more time. Honourable guy in action, Public displays of affection are not me - That wasn’t supposed to be a public display - Upstairs in a convicted Sex trafficker’s house in Belgravia…. / []
I'm 49 seconds into this, and I can see this man is lying 😂 / []
No indication 🤔,... What about the charges in Florida? / []
Now that Maxwell has been found guilty, I would imagine Andy must be shitting in his boots, day in, day out!! Karma eventually catches up with you - fact!! / []
Sex for a man is a "positive act" and is therefore not easy to forget....? Doesn't that suggest that women frequently forget having sex with people? / ["Lol. The results when too many people in a person's life just agree with any garbage they say.", 'Why would it suggest that?', "@jimmyandersson9938 It's clear, by implication. He suggests sex is particularly memorable for a man, because, mechanically, the man must be in a particular physical state to perform it and be the mechanical giver, not the receiver.\nThe natural consequence is that he's suggesting sex is less memorable - actually, comparatively easy to forget - for a woman than it is for a man, because she is the mechanical receiver. If that isn't what he's suggesting, there'd be no meaning in the distinction he makes  in the first place, so why bother to make it?..\nIt's all to be expected as he's obviously a complete and absolute idiot.", '@lewis7515 Could be, but the way I interpret it is simply he is a man and therefor just focus on the mans perspective, since they are talking about him and his memory. Stating a man likes sex isnt necessary saying women dont.\n\nKeep also in mind he is very nervous, stressed, uncomfortable etc and that makes you ramble alot of nonsense, combined with what you mention, a complete idiot.', '@jimmyandersson9938 No. This is nothing to do with anything? And it wasn\'t a matter of him stating, "he likes sex" - have you actually watched the interview? The terms there are very clear and very specific.\n\nHe is asked: "For the record, is there any way you could have had sex with that young woman [Virginia Giuffre Roberts], or any young woman trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, in any of his residences?" \n\nHe replies: "No - and, without putting too fine a point on it: if you’re a man it is a positive act, to have sex with somebody. \nYou have to take some sort of positive action - and so, therefore, if you _try_ to forget, it\'s very difficult to try and forget a positive action? \nAnd I do not remember, anything".\n\nThis is, obvious, complete garbage and an excercise in talking in circles - and there is only the one interpretation: \nHe is excusing himself of any recall or charge of having sex with somebody, _on the basis that_ it\'s not possible to forget you\'ve had sex, if you\'re a man - because a man, "has to take positive action to have sex with somebody": by which he clearly means being a sufficiently physiologically aroused state to commit himself into physically mating with female genitals.\n\nThis is nonsense: whether a man takes, "positive action", or not, is not a determinant of whether they remember having sex - nor is it a determinant in their ability to, "try to forget", having sex. \nBy example, man who was raped is going to try very hard to forget it but he will have great difficulty - yet he made no, "positive act"....What Andrew said is immediately meaningless as a basis on which to excuse himself of recall of having had sex.\n\nNothing he said is a satisfactory answer as to whether he had sex - furthermore, it\'s so ridiculous it\'s an insult to intelligence.\nThat\'s Number 1.\n\nNumber 2, is that the inference of his ridiculous comments are that women, are more able to forget having sex, because they do not take, "positive action". Again ask anyone who is forced into sex whthere it\'s easy to forget because they made no, "positive action". \n\nIt\'s ridiculous. He should go to jail for this, alone - because you know that someone who tells himself this and either believes it, or thinks anyone else is stupid enough to believe it; that person is capable to tell himself any kind of nonsense and may actually convince himself it\'s true.\n\nI\'d think very hard before being tempted to make any excuses for this fool.']

She meticulously collected all the facts for this interview. / ["Like a trial attorney...never ask a question you don't have the answer (to).  She allowed this creepy man to dig a hole, then jump inside.  A great interview.", 'Prince Andrew once rated the most attractive man in Great Britain. And today he may be rated as the most creepy man in GB.', 'She did a great job but did miss one opportunity when discussing his visit to the Palm Beach house. The housekeeper testified that she was aware of him getting a massage. I wish Emily had asked him directly if he had ever had a massage. Would have like to see him get around that question. Otherwise, it was a stellar job on her part.']

Riveting interview, but minutes in with his first response his mannerisms and ticks immediately gave him away as lying or just completely uncomfortable.   He was holding his breath a lot which is a tense reaction.  Not sure why he bothered to do this interview as it may have hurt him more than help.   Now the interview is coming back to light when the sensationalized news over Ghislaine’s conviction.  The strangest answer is the one surrounding him in a photo with the accuser and having no recollection.  It may seem like he’s lying or unusual, but it also appears to be a photo from ages ago.  I’ve come across photos of me with different people from ten years prior and I’ve wondered, “Who is that with me?  How come I don’t remember this photo being taken?”  So that is not exactly out of the question that he doesn’t recall it.  Doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.  Clearly there’s a photo. / []
Why doesn't Prince Andrew offer to meet Virginia Roberts, live on television, and let the viewers decide? / ['Because it needs discussing in court not round a table.', "@joannehowe7513 Not in Britain, it doesn't.", '@sheprekker9188 well, it won’t, the crime happened in the USA, so it needs to be reconciled there and not round a table, it’s a criminal investigation not Jerry springer.', "@joannehowe7513 Andrew won't go to the US, that's the point. If he has nothing to hide and if he is telling the truth then why not call her bluff and offer to a filmed meeting.", "@joannehowe7513 Furthermore, it isn't a criminal investigation, it is a civil litigation."]
7:50 you can see him checking out the interviewer’s legs / []
He is guilty as sin / []
GUILTY!! / []
This is like watching Chris Hansen interview a pedo on To Catch a Predator / []
Andrew:"Yes, that's me in the photograph, but that's not my hand. You see, there's a problem with this story. I temporarily lost my hand in the Falkland War and it didn't grow back until a year after this picture." / ['loool']
I find this interview sooooo hilarious. Guy is squirming / []
Bet he's sweating now 😂🤣 / []
This is just the funniest thing, and any rational human being can see through Prince Andrew like a piece of glass. Russian foot massage but you can't admit it? I would have said absolutely yes,  I had a Russian lady rub my feet. What a goofball liar. You went there with the expressed purpose of saying we shouldn't be seen together. Yeah, right. Then later on, when he is talking about himself in the third person.. by the way when people refer to themselves as "we", they are already arrogant beyond expression. / []
Now its time to bring this guy down / []
The arrogance of this man! / []
Lies, lies, lies, yeah 😂 / []
I wish so bad that he was “sweating bullets” during this interview. It would make this interaction all the more hilarious 🤣. Talk about a Major League Liar playing a PeeWee level game. Just how stupid does he believe the general public to be??? Imagine what the FBI secured from Epstein’s Island. Evidence that the general public would be completely shocked by. Finally, every time he speaks about how “convenient “ it was for him to stay with Epstein it comes across as though he doesn’t have the finances to stay anywhere else. What a JOKE !!! / []
This guy is such a lying piece of s*** / []
You’re  next Andrew! / []

Just remember, now Ghislane Maxwell has been found guilty, do people really think that so called ‘prince’ Andrew will be held to account is fairy tale world.  I’m English, and I can tell you now that anything the freeloading royal family do is above the law, whatever they or anyone else.  Shame really, I’m not a royalist, and I really think we could do without them all, especially all the ‘hangers on’ but I do admire the Queen and I think it is very sad for her that her son (who we are told is her favourite) is such a scum bag.  But equally, he doesn’t work now, not that I think he ever did, like most of the royals, (kept by the English taxpayers) but we are told that the Queen is keeping him now.  I do understand that he is her son and she loves him, but may I say respectfully your majesty, a big mistake.  She is now 95, having served this country for 79 plus years impeccably, what a shame this has happened to her now.  She has never shown her feelings in public, and good on her, but honestly, if Andrew was my son, I would despair.  Anyway, god bless the queen and really sorry that she has had to be lumbered with this horrible piece of humanity.  Also, really, if you think about Charles and Camilla, that wasn’t very savoury either, but the English have short memories, and now all is forgiven and Dianna has been air brushed away.  Very sad.  Let’s have a Republic.  At least you can vote them in and out even if there are, and of course there are, scandals.  Do ‘t like them, when their term is up, vote the lot of them out.  What we have now is a system where they reproduce and it goes on and on and on. / []
A walk in the park, dinner and slumber party, foot massages...if only all friendships ended like this. For a man who likes to be well informed and so in the know, learn about business, has infinite resources at his disposal including many convenient hotels to stay at, to say that he exercised poor judgement is just farcical. Not being able to remember is not the same as a categorical denial of the act itself. Can we just get on with a full prosecution, please? / []
If ever there was a person talking bollocks there’s your man.  How he hasn’t been bought. To justice is anyone’s guess.  Royalty or not, Andrew needs to be bought to justice.   Anyone with half a brain cell can tell he’s done wrong and can’t hide behind a title. / []

Nothing just a spoilt pampered brat. / ['Harsh, however, guilty as charged.']

"He had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together"  - you mean the "ability" of luring underage girls and serving them to powerful people in his lavish houses. What a twisted man!! / []

“He was very good at bringing people together” - “People” here being old rich dudes and underage women / ['My thoughts exactly.', '..at the groin area']
Emily: "Why shouldn't people believe the photograph is real?" Andrew:"Because it was taken upstairs." Me: So, if it was taken downstairs we all should believe it? / ['He also claims he never went upstairs. So if he never went upstairs how would he know the picture was taken upstairs?', '@trevorrowland9506 This guy has more holes in his story than a screen door.', '@thomasludwig9117 lmfaoo these comments have me laughing 😂 THANKS.', '@trevorrowland9506 Because he knew what downstairs looked like, so if it didnt look like downstairs, logically it must have been taken upstairs.']

Oh Wow 😮 Andrew response to this interview… “I’m delighted to be here with you today” 😂 yes here to bullshit my way out of all this. / []
He is fooooked / []
Every time he denies something, he closes his eyes. It’s a tell when someone is lying / ['🙄', '... so can we not blink?', '@hijislay3618 it’s not blinking and you know that', '@salicylicacid9945 Lol, I get you. I did mean it as a joke but your point makes more sense.', 'He does the eye closing thing at 48:13 when he admits that Epstein was a sex offender - does that mean he was lying about Epstein being a sex offender?\nI agree that he’s clearly full of shit, but I’m not sure that the eye closing necessarily means that he’s lying at a given moment. It might just be that he’s feeling stressed']
So he doesn’t want to continue his association with Epstein, not because his conduct is disgusting and reprehensible, but because of the scrutiny it would bring to him.  No outrage, no natural revulsion that could be expected from the father of two young girls, no disgust.  I find that incredibly revealing and significant. / ['His mouth and brain appear to be malfunctioning during this interview.', 'couldn’t piss off Epstein or Maxwell TOO MUCH because they have so much on him lmaoo so ofcourse he is tip toeing around his ‘reasons’', '@Peepers2 lmao 😂 pretty much he’s a friggin goober - frickin weirdo ; amazing watching him fall on his face.', 'I agree with you, his only motive for not showing anger or revulsion is that Maxwell has something on him. \nStrange how a trafficked girl would admit to having a camera, doesn’t sound right. It’s possible that Andrew fell into many traps with this story.', 'I couldn’t have put it better myself. Rewatching this video really highlights so much concern that it IS quite revealing. 👌🏽👌🏽']
He seems to be using Maxwell to distance himself from Epstein.  Now that she’s convicted on charges of sex trafficking, it has proven to be a fundamentally flawed strategy. / []
He had that extrordinary ability to bring together, eminent American pedophile. We had such fun. Spolit perv. / []
15:03 since his "suicide" hahahahaha. yeah right. / []
It's a uncomfortable watch isn't it...guilty as hell / []
Oozing with guilt! / []
Somebody is sweating 😓 now. One of the best interviews ever. / []
My judgement was coloured by being too honourable LMFAO tore too shreds ya BEAST!! / []
Of course the pic was photo-shopped, his hand wiz actually doon the back o` her knickers, / []
Hes full of bs we all know that. But the real question is, what happened to him..nothing, he is still a free man and living his life, he doesnt give f what you think you know or what you actualy know..its just that these big rich people get away with anything while when you steal a chewgum youll be labeled and jailed. / ['On 4th jan it will be decided if they are procecuting him or not.']
Just a straightforward shooting weekend / []
pathetic / []
No mention of Epstein paying down Sarah Fergusons debts? / []
Blah blah blah blah / []
Why did he do this interview. He's clearly lying and digging a bigger hole for himself. Toss a coin who's the bigger liar, him or Jussie Smollett. / []
Still a Grenadier Guard? Really? / []
10:15 ... "about what i was doing?" duuuuuude. / []
He really shouldn’t have done this interview. He dug himself deeper if anything. / ['Imagine the regrets he have felt ever since of ever agreeing to this interview..']
How is he not in prison?! He is such a piece of work. / []
This guy even second guessed his own lie of not being able to sweat 😂 what a clown. I hope he faces justice for this. / ["He's hilarious all through this interview ,his body language gives him away without even talking. What a disgusting pos", 'Trust me, I’m English and have to put up with the so-called royal family, and I can tell you now, absolutely nothing will happen to this little creep']
“He was in and out all over the place” says Andrew about Jeffrey Epstein…..with no sense of irony what so ever. / []
My comment is colored by my tendency to be too honorable. :) / []
Soon the FBI will be looking for him. He needs to be in jail this guy know he had sex with multiple young girls. Him and Donald Trump also hes another nasty dirtbag / ["They wont get him. He's rich and has plenty of social status - he'll get what he wants, when he wants it."]
Andrew should definitely not be involved in anything designed for 7-14 year olds. / []
PRISON / []
Give us another interview now Andy!  Tell us about how you wouldn’t really describe Ghislaine as a good friend.  ‘I barely knew her.  Ghislaine?  Well she’s British, so there’s that connection…but other than that I don’t really know her.’ / []
Gotcha.....worst liar ever. / []
The exact type of person the BBC covered up. The irony of it all. / []
Andrew: The photo is faked because I know it was taken upstairs so it couldn't have been me because I'd never been upstairs.  Inbreeding at its finest. / ['If you look at the photo you can see they are upstairs since they are standing next to stairs.']
The best way to lie is to simply say no, not adding fancy sentences after the no and try to make your no decorated. This guy needs to learn about lying 101. / []
Quite frankly, someone would need to be completely naive to believe in the most of Prince Andrew statement given above. Especially if they have heard yet those of the victims. Even his body language reveals none of a truth in what he says. Much respect to the interviewer for her cleverness and professional approach in this interrogation. / []
and so convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell was the "key element" in Epstein's invitation to the heart of the British Establishment.  Thanks Andy.  God I hope I'm a juror at your trial. / []
Where’s the body language analysis of this interview??? Please / []
His whole body language and behaviour just proves what a liar he is / []
Stitched up like a kipper. And shows he’s full of shit! 🤣 / []
She gave him plenty of rope and he used it to good effect / []
The photo was taken upstairs, it is him but not his hand. Okay people 😆 / []
You have no recollection of meeting her yet there is a picture of you with her and maxwell, how is this guy still free is beyond me simple proof this system is full of nonces and paedophile sympathisers / ['He is most likely lying but in general just because there is a picture of you with someone from a party 15 years ago doesnt mean you cant forget the person.']
19:21 “Do you remember her?”  His eyes say Yes. / []
This video about to become trending again soon. 😳 / []
What a great interview 👏 / []
His throat is clearly constricted with nerves as he practically chokes and coughs when asked if he would help a US enquiry.  That says it all. / []
"It was a convenient place to stay " mate your the queens son it's about time people woke up and got rid of that family / []
How does he know that photo was taken upstairs? 😂 / ['You can see the lower floor to the left on the picture']
even an unborn child could tell hes lying / []
Liar liar pants on fire. / []
If this was an episode of The Crown.... but its not. / []
It's apalling how the interviewer treats him - he is not on trial. She had not right to question him as if he is guilty. That's not her job. / ['You’re joking?! He agreed to an interview and Emily was completely calm and professional.  You do know Maxwell was found guilty in the US today?  Surprise. 🧐', '🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣', 'Ur a wrongun']
Having re-watched this following Maxwell's guilty verdict.... It's incredible that Andrew denies any wrongdoing, the man is screaming that he is hiding something through his choice of words, body language, everything about this interview is screaming that he is feeling overwhelming guilt. / ['I am also here rewatching after the guilty verdict and yes everything screams guilty!!', 'Or fear of being caught', "@tanyae727when this comes out, which I believe it will, it will rock the royal family to it's very core, possibly the biggest crisis in their history. Nobody is above the law, even the royal family.", '@Nikki-qw5il Agreed!', '@alexnowis2468 I have to admit that I have this awful feeling that he’s going to get away with it. I can see the passage of time, lack of hard evidence, and the best lawyers that money can buy combining to drag this thing out to the point of exhaustion.  That notwithstanding, this is going to be a lasting stain on the house of Windsor, one that may not be fatal in itself, but will likely be disabling at some level.']
"Too honourable"  😂 / []
master interviewer - thank you for this revelatory masterpiece / []
This is the funniest thing ive seen in a while. / []
😂 Liar / []
Them rooms at epsteins had secret cameras them particular files are what eventually got him killed … the royal family are no joke … as soon as they retrieved that footage i assume is when the suicide (cough cough ) took place … andrew if you ever read this you are a dirty seedy man that has no leg to stand on if only our justice system was for all you lucky silver spoon mongrel / []

Worst tactical mistake of his career to grant this interview the first being to have molested young girls which doesn't seem to pose much of a moral dilemma to him. / ['Yes, I agree.

It's also obvious that he needs to travel to the US to face justice. / []
I'm not an expert but his facial expression shows he is as guilty as the entire Britain. / []
How come his security detail wasn't asked to corroborate his story? / []
17:10 Watching Prince Andrew nervously attempt to distance himself from Epstein by using his girlfriend Maxwell as an aliby now suddenly seems very dishonest knowing that she has been found guilty of being an integral part of Epstein's sex ring.... 🤔🤔 / []
Had to watch this again after the guilty verdict!That young lady did good keeping that photo….  Ha! I kick myself when I forget it’s bin night! An uncomfortable Interview to watch but handled brilliantly by Emily! / []
Must hiding behind his title and money... / []
Ghislaine is guilty even he says she is clean...I hope he gets what he deserves too .. What à shame... / []
Maitlis: "you were staying at the home of a convicted sex offender" Prince Andrew: "It was a convenient place to stay"  Come on Andrew, spill the beans, Ghislaine is now surely weighing her options to get a lighter sentence. / []
"ah but the photo was taken upstairs and I was never upstairs in that house"...what an absolute cabbage his royal highness is 🤣 / ['Reminds me of the time my mate tried to ring the school reception pretending to be his dad and said he was sick.

He’s a lion 😂 / []
This is so softball and she doesn't press him when he is clearly lying. Shame on the BBC. It is time they were shut down also. We don't need a state media in 2021.   She doesn't press him at all on why he stayed with him when he "went to tell him he could not see him anymore." If that's why he went he should have gone there for half an hour and then left. You don't stay several nights with a child abuser.  Andrew is a disgusting liar and he arrogantly thinks he is smarter than everyone else. You can tell that this is a man that no one has ever spoken back to. He honestly thought he could claim the medical miracle of not being able to sweat at one point and then regaining the ability. You actually seem him realise he has to say "at the time" as he will be photographed sweating in the future. / []
“My judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable” / []
With Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction, is Andrew up next? / ['Well he’s considered the big prize, and the Americans certainly want him. \nUnfortunately I doubt very much they’ll ever get him.', 'There will be a hearing 4th jan, after that it will be decided if they move on with procecution of Andrew', '@jimmyandersson9938, I hope he trialed, at least! It’s important that people like him know that they will not get away with it']
I'd like to know if maxwell will confirm or deny the photo of Andrew with the girl in her apartment and her in the background of the photo is real or fake. Has she ever been asked, if not why not? / ['She was hiding before she got arrested, no one have had a chance to ask']
He will be fine because he is above the law as jimmy savil ,,,,Rolf Harris and Philip scofield, why do we protect pedofiles / []

Good news for Prince Andrew after the Ghislaine Maxwell guilty verdict. His sweat glands work perfectly now. / []
He must be charged as well / []
The best part is... all of it: when he gets flustered, then defaults to unbelievable denial and talking in circles - then, taking a slightly edgy, passive-aggressive and patronising, superior, tone when the blonde peasant just won't be impressed with him and his big room, and doesn't fawn and pander and just allow him to easily distance and unhook himself from this mess and then just piss off back to wherever she came from.  Acting like, "What ever could be wrong with her - she didn't act like this when we were talking earlier? This was supposed to be all done! Oh, fffff....." / []
Maxwell was found guilty of trafficking today with a max penalty of 60 years. Prince Andy is going to have to watch “big Stan” before he fly’s to the states. You’re time is coming too Andy. / []
Bet hes sweating now!!😂 😰 / []
Abolish the monarchy / []
Money sure can't buy intelligence. / []
I know ill get crucified for this and to be clear i believe he's hiding things. But i sympathises a little with his frustration when people say he had to have known what Epstein was up to. People seem to have this vison of a sex trafficker having a woman in each arm when he meets people and girls chained up in the basement. That's not how real life is. He was hardly going to have evidence of his crimes around the house for everyone to see. Especially a prince and his entourage. A murder doesn't commit his crimes in front of co-workers at his 9 to 5. He does it at night when no ones looking. / ['Its basically impossible to bring young girls to your house daily for years and hide it for people you hang out with. Entire hollywood knew what harvey weinstein was doing for example.']
Dunning Kruger in full effect / []
So as a Sub-Lieutenant the Duke of York had his first experience of coming under fire three years after joining the Royal Navy in 1979 where he had been shot at multiple times during his service in the South Atlantic Falklands war. How despicable these attempt of derogation & defamation must be for His Royal Highness which most civic interests don't quite percept, having read a lot of the abysmal comments on here as they don't quite consider that merely the alleger may be deem but the alleged is deemed b/w the opposite sexes in cases of misconduct ! / ['WTF']
Obviously guilty.  If the court fucks this up, then the only thing they've successfully determined is the court's complete lack of capability to hold the elite accountable. At that point, the public should pursue a less civilized method of delivering justice. It is morally necessary to strip this man of his powers, privileges and freedom. As with everyone else involved. / []
Here’s what he could have said to save his Royal ass- “I have been extremely ill-informed, living in the extremely protected bubble of royalty has left me rather ditzy about the real world, horrible people with agenda and the degree of crimes they commit in their private lives. Even when I have been away from the palace, I have only seen the honourable military life. I deeply regret my lack of knowledge, Ill judgment ridden with privilege...Since I only knew this man through his girlfriend, and barely saw him once a year I didn’t understand/know about his private affairs as much as I should/could have if I had stayed closer to him or saw him on a regular basis or kept in touch with American news. But once I did realise the magnitude of the allegation and his conviction I haven’t seen him in the past one decade. Thank you.” / ['Haha I hate that woman. She is delusional and stupid. Clearly feeds Andrews narcissistic ego in return for money.']
Even if the picture is morphed (which I don’t think it is) people are angry at the fact that he was seen hanging out with and inviting Epstein to Royal events MULTIPLE times even after he was accused, charged with so many different counts of rape, sexual abuse, sex trafficking under age girls, pedophilia and soliciting under age girls for prostitution. He stayed at ALL his private residences, he was invited to his personal parties and family dinners and vice versa. He literally went to “honourably end the friendship in person”. And yet says “we weren’t that close”, after being friends with the criminal for over a decade? THATS disgusting. And scary, stupid considering he had two teenage daughters himself at the time. *He has spent holidays and partied with a known sex offender on the British taxpayers money three times a year “tops”?* / []
What is the British royal family doing with taxpayer money? / []
“My judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable” is he quoting Michael Scott ? / []
21:40 for the sweat comment / []
This is uncomfortable / []
I must've watched this full interview about 25 times now and I don't know. Why is it so good / []
Just nasty 🤮…..why children? / []
8:57  Just like when Chris Hansen asks "what are you doing here?" And the nitwit responds "I came here to let her know I wasn't coming" GUILTY / []
Is he guilty? I cannot tell from this interview / ['100%']
Kudos to prince Andrew, I've never seen someone more committed to his denial of clear and obvious facts...great dedication   Oh no I don't sweat... Oh no that's not me...  "Prince Andrew, that is you...look you're even wearing the same clothes"  No it's not me  "Prince, we can see the serial number of your jacket in that picture. It's same serial number as the one you're wearing now. Look, 46399...same one"  No, that's not my jacket. I've never seen that jacket before.  "Prince Andrew, this is a video of you having sex with a 17 year old...listen to the audio...'Oh yes. I'm Prince Andrew. I'm having sex with a 17 year old girl. My social security number is _______.  Oh yeah, I love performing sexual assault on minors, my bank account number is _____ . Now, my 17 year old victim, go grab my wallet and my ID,  it's right there next to that paper that has my finger prints on it. Hold both of those up to the camera so I don't forget what room they are in later. Hold it really close so I can get a good look at my, Prince andrews, fingerprints and photo ID...I AM PRINCE ANDREW'   No that's not me. / []
The truth will always stay the same but the lies will always change.  This guy is the type to sit on the t.v and watch the couch. / []
All the comments here are from people who are far too confident in their ability to read subtle human emotions. / []
The interviewer, while extremely effective, is an accomplished professional.  He is completely out of his depth here, in no way capable of parrying her questions.  He’s the guy who brought a knife to a gunfight. / []
I would doubt that anyone on his PR team or any of his handlers would ever find a job in that capacity again after this travesty.  Some of his answers are absolutely toxic. / []
He's guilty as fuck / []
such a liar / []
bla bla bla dig ones own grave bla bla / []
He let the side down.  What kinda excuse is that? / []
Absolutely no way he did anything wrong. / ['Show me the money!!!!!', "I'm concerned that you sat down and watched this, then somehow came to this conclusion."]
“I have no memory of ever meeting her” “There’s a photograph of that evening” / []
“I don’t know where the bar is in tramps” 1 min later “I don’t remember buying a drink when I was there” / []
Highlights: 13:39 - 14:50  Denies essentially making any contact with Epstein despite residing in the same flat at the time.  16:35 - probably the most terrible execution of a lie I've ever seen  19:15 > A large chunk of what is essentially the part of the interview where he digs his own grave. Most iconic and famous parts of the interview are mainly from here to about 26 minutes into the video  26:45 denies going upstairs in a house. Genius  These are my personal highlights of it. There's a lot more content than this but if you know about the incident and skim the video this is what I'd watch. / ['Thank u so much!', '@Pendant-s6g np lol', "36.03 reaction is just a trigger for him for some reason. The guy didn't answer the question 'being near Epstein' but was blabbering about his pompous lifestyle filled with staff. The photographs of Maxwell on the throne are on the internet."]
"I have a medical condition where I can't sweat"   46:59 *is visibly sweating on his forehead* / []
Cringeworthy interview.I think Andrew liked being pally with the wealthy Mr Epstein.Hi is not guilty of rape,but his moral behaviour was of a low standard.He is the father of daughters,and must have realised what was going on,on Epstein’s Island.Sarah Fergusson accepted money to pay off debts,from Mr Epstein,after he was charged with paying underage girls for sex.Now with Prince Charles, discovered to have awarded honours for cash,to a Saudi National,it appears that these members of the Royal Family do not like spending their own money.There is something rotten in The House of Windsor.Andrew did not have a fall guy, unfortunately. / []
“If your a man it’s a positive act to have sex with someone.” This man is pure comedy gold. 😂 / ['What the fuck does that even mean, though? 😁 Comedy gold from an hour of word salad.', '@Debagio makes me laugh he thought in his head, this a good one I’ll say this. 😂😂', 'He must\'ve been thinking "how do I say that I love shagging so much that I remember every last one" in a way that won\'t make me bark and drool..?', 'Hahaha. Where did he say that exactly tho. Trying to find that part', "@Debagio it just refers to the fact that men have to be active in order to have sex. if you are completely passive and never talk to anyone, for example, then a man won't have sex regardless of how good-looking he is. and if you go out of your way to be active, then you're not going to forget it. what he's saying is actually correct, it's just a bit strange to bring it up in this interview."]
The fact that he laughs! What is funny about hanging around with a convicted sex offender or human trafficking?? / []
Lizards don’t sweat aswell / []
Hi Andrew you are a lier. India people  always say in case  of interview like this " Andrew boy you are trying to hide a huge pumpkin in a plate of rice". Did you ever see Bill Clinton inside his mansions and island mansions? To cut it short Maxwel is going to expose the whole story. If it is true you also must go to prison for child abuse. In my 20 years  of  experience  in  handling  child  abuse  cases 365 days in a year I have come across many cases where big guys were involved , I tell  you  again YOU ARE TELLING LIES. I am sure there are other big heads to fall .  True democracy  Britain  🇬🇧  royal families must vacate Buckingham palace. MY HATS OFF TO YOUTUBE.

He has sullied the memory of his dad. Andrew is a thoroughly pathetic man. / []
Nothing, and he's lost his memory / []
American cheerleaders will not. / []
" Discussing your Work ". ...... He doesn't do any work 🙄 .... Unless you can call poncing off the UK Taxpayer's work  . / []
Fat pig, you can see on his face that he is guilty, hope he will end up in prisone for the rest of his shit life / []
"I went over there (NY) and stayed at his house to tell him (epstein) in person that we should not be seen together in public while we walked through the park.Then we got photographed together in the park." says the Buffoon. / []
Sounds like she obtained a confession from this buffoon. / []
This BBC interviewer reminds me of the equivalent American PBS non-Journalist approach. Guilty until proven innocent. Andy spoke too much, less is best. Who advised him to do this or is this arrogance or stupidity? I don’t know if he is innocent or guilty but he did himself no favor here. / ['Hahaha he is guilty. American "journalists" often just blow smoke up peoples arses. They don\'t deserve to be called journalists.']
He is only guilty of being too honorable.   What a piece of shit…. / []
He has not even once said how it is disgusting and awful act of sexually abusing minors or shown any sympathy towards the victims and that he should not have been friends with such a person .Instead he says the friendship was beneficial to him so he don't regret it that much.How can an honourable person with any morals not feel disgusted that he was associated with such a criminal just because you had some benefiets.The interviewer does her best to calmly let him prove his lies. / []
Fake coughing stuttering all classic signs  of lying / []
Horny Andy is so silly. The only way his still walking free is he was born in certain family. If he would be born at council estate in Leeds he would eat spam sandwich at HMP Armley. / []
Prince Andrew proves above all proved that you can be so stupid and still a prince. Really this interview is so Bad. The interview was not mandatory, still he decided to have it, had time to prepare and has advisors and still he only made his situation worse giving this interview / []
This is 49 minutes and 26 seconds of pure gold. / []
13:30 i had nothing... or had i? no i had nothing to do with. (his brain)     13:41 that face my god xDDD  13:50 his face.. like a child that gets caught with something bad. My god.. / []
"to bring the most extraordinary people together" yep.. a way to say it. / []
It wasn't just under age girls who epstein was trafficking. This guy swings both ways and thats the real royal scandal. / []
in all the times I visited I dont know what I was doing, wtf / ['Andrew you are a deviant person who uses his postion.']
It's clear that all the stars are falling one by one.  *Good will always conquer evil.❕❕❕* / []
He’s lying about his “travelling clothes” - look at the photo of him and Epstein in the park, he’s in jeans and trainers. / []
It was a convenient place for home to stay 😂😂😂 , Dear Prince that’s the problem / []
I don't sweat lol 😆 🤣 😂 😅 / []
That couldn't have been me because the picture was taken upstairs and I never went upstairs in epsteins house....lol wtf how would you know what the upstairs looks like then 🤣 / []
You know what else doesn't sweat? Reptiles. Illuminati confirmed! / []
Watta lier / []
Oh dear 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ / []
This interview is damning, yet here we are two years later and this absolute bollocks still hasn't been brought to heel. Interviewer did amazing work here. She didn't get aggressive or demand specificity, just let the mans own words condemn him. Lying sack of shite. The fact that nothing ever came of this show the power these people hold. / []
I'm  not surprised  by this prince sleeping  around with Under age girls. This royal family  married and still does their cousins / []
“I can only sweat on Tuesdays” / []
Thank god they didn’t disable comments for this 😂 / []
Damn keep him away from cameras he basically told on himself / []
When someone is answering the question before its even finished being asked there normally lying / []
This was like watching a slow moving plane crash….. / []
I watch this at least once every two months. Nothing comes close to this masterpiece. / ['yes his answers really were masterpieces', "It's absolute gold.", 'Indeed', 'I wish he would do another interview !\nI love a good cringe.', 'Omg same! Top quality comedy']
섹스  어디까지  해봤어  기자  단추옷  이쁘네 / []
자기야 / []
Liar Liar Pants are on Fire? / []
I never had met her...  But there's a photo of you both together...  Well, it obviously isn't real because I can't remember anyone taking a photo of me!! / []
"you stayed at the house of a sex offender..."  "Well, it seemed convenient at the time..."  Pure comedy gold 🤣🤣 / []
An innocent person would hear these allegations would be shocked and disgusted to hear it. This guy never once expressed disgust. Never said anything along the lines of “sexual contact with children is disgusting and I’m horrified that people think I did this.” All he did was talk in circles. He even called Epstein’s crimes “unbecoming”. What a POS / ['The man is a fool thinking he can deceive the entire world with an interview. Hes been caught red handed.']
“I don’t know who Brockman is” but as soon as that lady said the name he looked surprised and guilty af lmao, and that was BEFORE she told him what Brockman said about him. / []
The poor get interrogated The rich get interviewed / []
So he can't remember meeting her but he's convinced he never had sex with her. Aye righto, very convenient. He also because of his work with the NSPCC he could recognise signs of abuse but didn't see any with Epstein. He is so inconsistent, he is clearly lying. / []
Nothing he could do if he ended up on p o r n h u b with the one young girl and others😂😂😂  Where was Chris Hansen from "To Catch a Predator" at the time? / []
😂😂😂Liar / []
Worst liar in existence. / []
Working closely with the NSPCC full stop campaign! Funny that 🤭 / []
I absolutely. love this interviewer. / []
The fact that he wasn’t sweating bullets in this interview makes me believe he can’t sweat / []
13:43 shits himself / []
Englishman here. We all love a good straightforward  shooting weekend, we can’t get enough of them / []
Everytime I watch this interview it reminds me of Spitting Image! But this is far more hilarious! / []
Could Epstein be the next Rasputin? Tune in next week to find out! Such tabloid garbage. 😂 yall got a weird relationship with your monarchy. Wheres the evidence because we can sling mud all day. I see this interview differently. I see it as he said she said but it is evidence that we use to convict princes and paupers / []
25:49 - "I dont recollect that photo being taken" and yet he confirms that it was him 😒 children could do a lot better work in lying than him.. and the sickest fact about him is he could get away with just about anything because he is part of the "Royals" / []
This is so laughable on his part / []
And so he said....."I was there". It seems he is always invited in the most private occasions, party. This is the trend now we can see, high class high profiled sex offenders. May the Lord deal with this people severely. Many will witness his  downfall especially if he made webs of lie where he will fall himself. His face paints guilt all over.imagine if this was your dad,  your husband and son.......all respect goes to the bin. / []
PA:When was he arrested?  Interviewer:July PA:No it was WAY before July  🥴 Sir come with the lies prepared please / []
The amount of lies! He's so readable! / []
My god he should be banned from interviews 😂 / []
I don't potty at Jeffrey's 😂 / []
This is so bad 😆😆 / []
Guilty. / []
Andrew loves veal tenderloin. Young and tender. No recollection of that sweet young entre because he's had it so regularly. / []
Interviewer: what is your name?  Andy: I have absolutely no recollection... / []
When you feel like you’re having a shit day, this car crash of an interview always make me realise my life isn’t this bad 🤣 / []
"I don't where the bar is".....this guy. I can't. / []
I always liked the moment when his Highness states that he went to Jeffery Epstein' s mansion after his release from prison just to confront him that it was not a good idea to be seen together!!!   That is a bit stretch, Your Highness? / []
Don’t worry guys, he’s “never really partied.” / []
The girl said He did it , and the picture is worth 1,000 words. He can’t buy it back out of the public eyes 👀, and lying is only making worse for his image and the Royal Family! It can’t be covered up now!  It’s only going to get worse! / []
The guy could've straight up confessed and it would be less convincing than this interview / []
Can someone just check if he was at pizza express or not lol / []
His body language reeks of guilt. Lol. / []
46:20 Yet sinned I not but in mistaking 🙄 / []
is he somehow relative to the bush family,,i think there is some familiarities..well the disgusting brain is there but something else to,,we know the brittish royals aint the real royals,,that broke a while back when brittain was in war and the king was on campaign and the queen had a affair with an bowman,,and voila the royals off today..so its fake and the real family lives in usa somewhere. / []
Das Referendum über den Verbleib des Vereinigten Königreichs in der Europäischen Union (englisch Referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union), auch als „EU-Referendum“ oder „Brexit-Referendum“ bezeichnet, war ein konsultatives Referendum (Volksbefragung).

I was expecting the queen to come up behind him and put her hand over his mouth lol 😂 / []
prince Andrew: that photo was taken upstairs, ive never been upstairs how tf do you know what upstairs looks like then ??? / []
In the movie equilibrium we had "sense" offenders, here we just have Andy Pandy ol'boy. / []
He knows J.E set him up at the park.J.E was blackmailing him,that's the only reason,he was Photographed.He could have just phoned him.He keeps saying " I had to go see him" I bet you he did & with a Big chunk of Money too! / []
This looks like a episode of "to catch a predator" / []
10:16 🤣 / []
oh god. this is so entertaining 😀 / []
It was a straigthforward shooting weekend / []
The fact that he got and will continue to get away with it is so depressing. / ['No Maxwell is right now in court. She wants to get away and will do everything for that. He will fall too.', 'He ain’t gonna get away with shit.']
This feels a bit like R Kelly’s interview. / []
2 years and no account. truly bs. / []
Elizabeth has managed to produce losers like him and then she got her Hitler loving grandkid Harry who ran away with his wife to another country for greener pasture.  This is like A&E’s “Trailer Trash diaries-UK” in the making. / []
3:10 gives me the feelings from the court scene about Shaun notes and Anderson in the movie sleepers… scary how these absolute nonces are. Held in esteem.. absolutely hilarious / []
Disgusting pompous odious man. / []
This is painful / ['Very']
He is so guilty. / []
Why isnt he jaied yet???!!! / []
The fact this man has to say Um.. every other second and see his eyes unable to hold contact while shows he is lying and nervous as all hell. Trash. / []
DID PA SAY AT BEGINNING OF INTERVIEW THAT HE "WORKS" FOR NSPCC, SO THAT GIVES HIM INSIGHT AS TO THE SIGNS TO WATCH OUT FOR CONCERNING CHILD ABUSE, AND THEN LATER IN THIS SAME INTERVIEW SAYS THAT HE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO RECOGNISE SIGNS OF CHILD ABUSE? NAC!! / []
A LAUGH FROM PA EACH TIME THAT THE  INTERVIEWER STATED THAT EPSTEIN IS NOW DEAD?.....WHY? NAC!! / []
At 8:45 you can literally see him breaking down because it so hard for him to lie to the entire world on national TV just look into his eyes you can see his soul crumbling apart as all his demons are coming out to fuck him right back / []
This guy is full of royal shit. Enjoy prision your highness. / []
Lying POS! / []
Entire royal family is just a waste of money and space / []
Seriously, with the kind of wealth and power the British royal family has, they couldn’t afford to hire someone to prep this guy for the interview? Absolutely disastrous interview. Horrible, horrible attempts at lying. / []
Media, explore everyone,. Drugged, grommed, sex worker's. Is used a fishing,  later the media blow this up Behind,. That is lawyer's,, bankers, invest,.   And again,. ..... Police upscale. / []
Hilarious. Fuck the British royal class. Dunning kruger effect / []
I love the bit he wracked  his brain and nothing l couldn't  stop laughing. / []
Emily deserves a medal / []
Better to be thought an idiot and say nothing, than open your mouth and confirm it, your royal lowness!! / []
This will be be shown in the future as masterclass in how to screw yourself completely. / []
this is not an interview, this is bullying. When did it become ok to harass people like this? Just a vulgar interview / ['Bill Clinton ? Is that you ?']
Lmfao how is this interview real / []
Prince Andrew is Every Chinese and Japanese girl 😍😍😍DREAM GUY OMG 😍😍😍 / []
It's actually not difficult to say she's lying if you didn't do it. / []
Liar and stop hiding behind you mummy. You and your children’s mother are both scoundrels. / []
Epstein was a "plus one." omfg / []
Who preped his man for the interview set him up so hard😂 This man is the worst liar ever and everything he says contradicts himself! / []
Interviewer: welcome back for this second interview.  Andrew: i have no recollection of the first 1. Interviewer: But we were on tv together. Andrew: oh thats definitely me but i have no recollection and i wasnt sweating at that time either. 😂😂 / []
Some liar / []
This is why YT disabled dislikes / []
So what if he likes young gash😂 / []
The way he reacts to his own ords reminds me of Hagrid being like welp I shouldn’t have said that / []
This is comedy gold! Really the best laugh I have had all year! Emily deserves a medal for this! / ['Make that medal a Knighthood.']
Sorry but I do not believe him  And  this interview showing that he is liar  And he is not only one from Royal Family who is lying  He probably think that it will never would leak ! / []
We know the following;  Carolyn had been giving Jeffrey massages 3 times  per week during approximately 6 years, voluntarily which excludes abuse  because she did it voluntarily. Carolyn stated that she was paid $300  per massage, 3 times per week = $900per week.  There are 52 weeks in one  year so 52 weeks  times $900 = $46,800 per year.  And 6 years times  $46,800 = $280,800 without paying taxes, because the girls were paid by  cash and they never pay taxes. Which means they are guilty of the crime  of tax evasion.  The parents of the under age girls are also responsible  for their behavior. / []
😂😂😂 / []
this type of videos are the reason why disslikes are ban / []
Bro, get a life you sex offender. Admit. / []
He is liying too much. It is obvious!!] / []
Bro guilty af 😂 / []
We know he knows everything. / []
Poor man needs too go specsavers, does not see anything. I saw nothing.. / []
Juke of Joke, / []
I don't think he screwed himself on the interview, he denied everything, but if he's lying the truth will get out perhaps somehow. I think the whole bunch is lying to save themselves. So maybe he is but it has to be proven. / []
Look at the poor thing , all the worries of the world on his shoulders. The only thing he’s upset about is the fact he’s guilty and he’s trying to bullshit his way out of trouble. / []
The history of royalty using and abusing the “common” people is long. This is why most countries have removed their monarchies. / []
Queen Elizabeth ll should be ashamed of herself and Prince Charles and William.. They have already Knick Prince Andrew and Family out of Royal Family! / []
i feel sorry for the queen who has been a hard working- loyal to uk - great lady - hurt by this piece of poo / []
Your 15 minutes of fame is over. Go away Andrew. / []
Should have brought out the girl in the picture and had them argue it out right there / []
This is hard to watch. What a horrible human being. / []
2021 There are more victims coming out testifying seeing Andrew at Epstein's mansions. In the 90s, paparazzis reported his' and Fergie's every moves. He was attending these mundane gatherings very often that I remember vividly. So no need to lie about it Prince Andrew. You definitely was.   Thanks, Diana never got involved with Epstein nor with Andrew. She was a little older than he was and she had her own sh't going on. Andrew was the youngest lad that just got out of the army.  Prince William and Prince Harry are probably the best thing that could  ever happen to this family. Diana wins after all, even after her death. / []
This is absolutely great to revisit. This man is a horrible liar 😂 / ['Literally i m sitting at the toilet watching this for amusement 😂', "shocking how the system works. \n\nthis is that one rule for them....and we follow what these people say? Boris should get involved but won't because he isn't on that level", '😂😂😂Liar Liar Pants of Fire😂', 'Everytime he denies, he closes his eyes, starts blinking really fast. Body language never lies']
Nothing stroke him as suspicious... What an idiot this guy must be. / []
She made mince meat of him. / []
Money does not buy intelligence.  What a narcissist and such an idiot!  Goodness. / []
what medical condition is that?! LOL / []
Impossible, I couldn't sweat at the time because of a medical condition.  However, I can sweat now because of recent steps I've taken 😂 / []
So glad my taxes don’t go to a royal family with impunity. Seriously. How much work have they done in their lives? This man went  to go to the top schools, straight into the navy and then get a top position as a diplomat into the economy of a nation…..he will never be convicted because he’s a royal…but not in America. Land of the free, home of the brave. Get some. 🇺🇸. Since he’s super innocent, he won’t touch ground in the United States ever again. He knows he’ll get arrested without royal leverage. / []
I can’t sweat. / []
He’s lying, he initially said that he left after the friendship breakup on the 10th but he stayed additional night, got a foot rub and attended the dinner party. There’s photos of him taken by Epstein. / []
Why would he even allow himself to be in this interview? Its suicide interview. Its like self incrimination... / []
Why isn't he locked up? I'm disgusted. / []
Hope he's squirming in his jeans this week as the Maxwell trial gets under way. Just imagine what could come out and be made public........ / []
I - I - I - I - I - hav - ha - have a pe - pe - pe - pe - peculiar medical co - co - co condition" - yes you do, you st - st - st - st stutter uncontrollably when you are lying!!!! / []
I cannot watch this, I had to stop, does he think we are that naive. He is such an idiot. Plus he is so arrogant, he know very well he took a photo with the then 16 year old girl. On a side note, he told people after this interview that there is a very high probability that the picture was photoshopped. / []
He dry snitching on himself and dont even know it / []
He never even once says he’s sorry for the victims at all, like it literally didn’t even cross his mind to lie about that Plus the fact that he chuckles and says he only regrets the friendship after he was convicted - even in his lies he clearly doesn’t care about the actual crime itself :”) / []
"well you HAVE to remember....." uh HUH..... " well i have no memory of that at all." uh HUH...... / []
Lie detector test 😂 / []
I was watching this yesterday and then I stopped because it was so obvious how guilty he is. It's so uncomfortable for me hahaha. And then, I tried watching this again today because I really want to know his answers. But, I'm still uncomfortable of how bad of a liar he is. I can't take this second hand embarrassment hahaha / []
Eyes never lie...! / []
My congrats to royal family, one could assume that royal perverts are thing of past, but royal family tells us that they are still bold in the business / []
Is he in jail? / []
“The photograph is taken upstairs, and I don’t think I ever went upstairs in Ghislaine’s house” Well how do you know what the upstairs looked like…? / []
NEXT how about an interview with Charles regarding his 'association' with Jimmy Saville ????? / []
Interviewers would make the best lawyers lol / []
Sickens me that this idiot has not been stripped of his HRH title ! Her Harry and his mother were / []
In 1996 I met a former employee of Andy's who told me he was a paedo, and had demanded the employee bring him younger and younger children. / []
Young girls children to be exact terrible 😢 / []
He should be prosecuted along with the rest of them !!!!!! / []
Everyone knows the truth !!!!!! / []
Guilty..... / []
So guilty. All over his face and interview. / []
he was so guilty 🤣🤣 / []
Lol / []
He is a filthy liar. Only thing true is his connection to Maxwell and Epstein. He's cooked. / []
Where’s Polanski? / []
God save the teen. / []
You're busted! Serves you right! / []
She says that the much younger and single Prince Andrew took her out to dinner and then out dancing at Tramps. If this was a matter of being paid for prostitution, I don't think they would have been taken out to dinner and then out dancing at a nightclub. And he certainly wouldn't have posed for a photo with her beforehand! I don't believe the prince thought this was anything more than a normal date. / []
When Ghillaine goes down let's hear what he has to say. / []
"when the first allegation came out I thought 🤔 that's a bit strange" / []
The tabloids that covered ‘Randy Andy’ for many years were owned by Ghislaine Maxwell’s father Robert Maxwell . / []
44:43 Tim Nice But Dim / []
11:52 this reaction 🤣 / []
Good luck on a conviction. Isn't his Mother a Queen and that makes him Royal. Prince Andrew you do have a conscious and that is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. Better to just tell the truth that way you can free your consciousness. / []
I don’t know this guy, but you can tell when someone who is guilty, when you can see liar wrote on his forehead / []
Err I’m sorry why would ? / []
I had a very peculiar medical condition at the time I just didn’t sweat I’ve only been able to start sweating in most recent years due to some medical experiments which allows me to only begin to sweat now / []
He's not a very good lier is he,lime light struck / []
Long story short : he's a DIDDLER. / []
Just deny deny deny and all lies. I feel like I'm watching a teenager make up bad lies to his mother. Just utter bullshit lies he tells. / []
This is just ridiculous.  And Megan is being hounded for what she is doing? Please! This man has engaged in criminal activity! / ['I was thinking the same thing. They hounded her from beginning to end. Diana and Fergie were also dogged out. Meanwhile this is what a prince is doing.']
All the while the sweat drips out of his shoes onto the cheap rug.The bags under the eyes never lie ! / []
Most people go through life dreading they’ll have a traumatic experience. Freaks were born with their trauma. They’ve already passed their test in life. They’re aristocrats. / []
Ghislaine Maxwells trial brought me back to listen to his "I don't sweat" defense again.... / []
I stayed at his house but hardly saw him, he's a very busy man and very difficult to find time to talk to him.... Well phone him up then or send an email.  I stayed with Epstein (after his conviction and release), because it was a convenient place to stay. Then later says the Governor Generals house was almost beside Epsteins and he had accommodation which Andrew could request to use? / []
He's a lying shit / []
The Royals are killers they come from a long line of killers. This is what people forget. They killt and killt for all the money they got. This is there historie. They are not nice people.

I can´t sweet. Come on. Ask other soldiers that have bin shot at if they can´t sweet. Yes they can sweet. Andrew is a big big lier. / []
Yes, everyone else Is a liar and he is "too honorable". Scumbags / []
Liar Liar Liar... / []
I feel sorry for him. His dad cheated on the Queen around the world, he just did what his dad did and mum tolerated. / ["Sara Rossborough-Muhammad I think they dud that in the aristocracy but...what did everyone expect of Charles and this guy when that's the model."]
What a comedy listening to Prince Phillips ridiculous lies...a constant sore he says. People are not stupid. They know you did it. I guess that's why he hides in the U.K. Does the U.K. really believe him? / ["Prince Andrew, and no, we don't."]

Pure evil him / []
But he won’t go to prison???? / []
We don’t believe your lies! / []
So you went to go tell him IN PERSON you shouldn't be seen together? Instead of calling him and telling him over the phone? Chicken's way of doing it? He touched kids, who gives a flying crap if you tell him to his face or not that your friendship is over, unless you're there to beat his head in why did you go over there? / []
Surley they have diary wher andew was he is famous had body guards . He needs go court clear his name if hes telling truth. But i think pinnochio tells better story / []
Strange how he has just gained a stutter pure lies andy dug bigger hole than grand canyon / []
What a embareesment / []
Min 32:25 „When the allegations came i was like…did i really do this oh gosh i dont remeber…i srewed to may young daughters!!! 🤣 why is nobody puttin this man to jail???and rhe rest if the pedo society crew…disgusting / []
This man shiuld be in jail!!! How can we believe in right when a royal is screwing lil girls and get away with it….he is so obviously liying!!! / []

what a lying tosser. get him in court, sorry i cannot attend as im going to pizza hut, a blatant liar / []
He took his daughter  to pizza  Express  at 5pm tramps nightclub  starts  around 10pm / []
i've only watched 3 mins of this and already when she asked "was that his appeal, then?", referring to Andrew's comment on Epstein's ability to bring great people together, I can see that he said "yeah" while shaking his head very subtly. If you know anything about body language you'll know that this is one of the most heavily relied-upon cues to discern untruthful responses. / []
This is unbearable to watch , the monarchy is finished ✅ / []
It's incredible how the truth is slowly revealed / []
He should have been in jail / []
Shame😆😆😊 he lie with a straight face. / []
This was the best admission of guilt by trying to remain the innocent prince. This man along with the rest of his "acquaintances " should be imprisoned for crimes against children.  The arrogance of this man is astoundingly disgusting. / []
Entire UK in one interview. / ['Leave Scotland out of this!', '@heybejaybe809 how’s you different? You can sweat?', "@alexc2826 We're not English. We have a different mentality! And yes, we can sweat even AFTER an overdose of adrenaline 🤣"]
On whose behalf Jeffrey Epstein was murdered??? / []
oh shame Andrew why you stuttering ..but close friend Jeffrey Epstein is dead now. / []
He is discusting / []
It was like watching him age and become a child at the same time. / []
GUILTY!!! Brought shame on his mother and family. Shame on him! / []

The good old "Sweat" defense! Right up there with the "Twinkie" defense! We Yanks have a tried and true saying and practice here in the U.S.A., Andy "Lawyer up and SHUT UP"! / []
If you are lying, stutter and blink incessantly, Andy! Please see your physician, immediately, Andy!! You are showing the symptoms of Early On-Set Alzheimer's!!!! / []
I stayed with him, to tell him, I couldn’t stay with him after he had been convicted / []
1.10 'it would be a stretch to say we were close friends' later on 'i had to fly to him to tell him we could no longer be friends'... doesn't add up. / []
If he wasn't your good friend why do you owe a visit as apposed to a phone call 🤔? / []
NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Charles and Andrew OOOOZE it! / []
Andrew is a Narcissist, it was his 'grandiosity' that compelled him to do this interview against the advice he was given, again his 'grandiosity' and lack of 'self awareness' were evident throughout this interview, he's just 'too honourable' isn't he? Narcissists can not take responsibility for their actions, they are compulsive liars and they have zero empathy, he doesn't care about his victims and will try to destroy their reputation using whatever vile slurs he can make stick. / []
Hats off to the interviewer for keeping a straight face the whole hour. 👏👏👏 / []
This is one of the most unintentionally hilarious interviews. incredible. disgusting and absolutely jarring, but hilarious. / []
He is a terrible liar. / []
You are guilty period / []
🤥 / []
It took 4 days to break  off the friendship . / []
He told Epstein  in 2006 but yet he went back to stay with him again  in 2010 for more parties. / []
The facade of his family including two fairytale princess is nothing but a joke. / []
It’s like listening to Trum! / []
YOU CAN RUN AND HIDE ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME. AND MUMS NOT THE WORD. BE A BIG BOY AND TAKE YOUR SPANKING. / []
why is this thing not locked up / ['Elite lizard']
……..and yes to all of it, man up for once in your entitled, strange pathetic life. You know as well as the rest of the world does your a joke, your stupid excuses are just amazing. Amazing you think we believe a word you say. You remember everything and you know it. Your simply a creep / []
Fuck the elites. The queens is fucked for not dealing with this creep. / []
If he did it's wrong and he should be tried. But I think these girls that were teenage prostitutes at the end of the day are  just helped my money being led by lawyers. / []
LOL if Guilty was a person 🤣 / []
I bet those Epstein rooms got a boat load of footage. / []
Worst bloody liar in history. / []
A royal piece of s*** / []
He denies Epstein was a 'close friend' and claims that his friend was really Ghislaine Maxwell as if SHE is a close friend - he totally misses the fact that Maxwell is just as bad as Epstein as she was the one 'supplying' girls for Epstein and she often abused the girls and took part in the sexual abuse of minors!! He is ubelievably arrogant and insensitive.  To add insult to injury he is doing this interview at Buckingham Palace -his mother's house - I suspect that The Queen knew nothing about this but he is using the Palace to enhance his own sense of power and importance. Unbelievable. He's cooked his own goose and I suspect the below stairs staff were happy to supply the oil and matches. / []
One of the most frustrating things to be captured via audiovisual technology. / []
Epstein did not commit suicide. / []
Lies just ooze from this mans mouth.... / []
I love how British people pronounce , 'can't,; they pronounce it like the naughty word for vagina!!..lollol / []
entrapment? / []
What a creep / []
how is he not in jail shocking / []
I hope he is enjoying the Ghislane Maxwell trial. / []
It is sad how there are two different justice systems, one for the poor and weak and another for the wealthy and powerful. If “Randy Andy” were a normal bloke he would already be convicted. / []
One word ties all of this together from Epstein and all his associates the comings and goings the need  for Prince Andrew to try and explain his part in this, that word links everything together and makes sense of it all, the word is SEX! / []
YouTube knows EXACTLY when I’m in the mood for a comedy with some good old “dry” English humor.         See what I did there? 😂 / []
I don't know where Tramps is. I don't drink. I don't recall buying a drink at Tramps whenever I WAS THERE. I was at home with the children. / []
Interviewer: Another guest was John Brokman the literary agent.  Andrew: really 😳?? Interviewer: He said he saw you getting a foot massage from a young Russian girl. Andrew: I don't know him so I don't know what he said. / []
Boy oo boy stumbling and bumbling through this interview he's guilty as all hell or he knows something / []
I still don't understand what he was sweating and panicking for... dude you're a royal.   He could have outwardly admitted to hurting those kids and face zero consequences anyway. / []
The queen actually  has them🤡as children! This one even looks dumb. / []
Price Andrew all the best education that England has to offer and this is the best you can do? / []
Not just his skin thats thick then. / []
Um counter 728 / []
When a man starts stuttering uncontrollably and nearly chokes to death on his own spit and has to clear his throat so as not to dye....you know he's lying. Wow-imagine being asked if you would LEGALLY testify and/or be questioned in a court of law and your face turns beat red, your eyes start moving rapidly, your chest moves from deep breaths and then it seems as if God is coming for you... YOU ARE LYING! / []
I like Prince Andrew - he's our best shot yet of doing away with the Royals once his mum croaks. / []
I’m pretty sure the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs did less damage than this interview!! / []
How to dig quickly his grave..... / []
He really thinks that England and the rest of the worlds normal people are stupid, Is this really how he thinks of us all? And he’s a prince !? Wow just wow / []
I don’t know about you, but a statutory rape charge doesn’t just fall out of the sky. I get he is a public figure. However, he couldn’t look more guilty / []
I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment without chance of appeal. 😂 / []
I’m confused by it being ‘inappropriate to be seen together’. Shouldn’t he mean it’s inappropriate - or, better yet, unacceptable and an absolute deal breaker - to be apart of his life in any capacity (given Epstein’s deplorable and utterly reprehensible/criminal actions)?! The way it’s worded implies the new acceptable recourse is that they must maintain their friendship in secret going forward, merely owing to how it would look (from a PR perspective). Versus a view of the friendship itself categorically ending, as it should have. Super telling, in my opinion. / []
To this day, This is unbelievable ! / []
phonemenal car crash tv....gripping loved every min ....of this repeatedly, shame this wont b in the crown....prince Andrew dug his own grave and the arrogance couldnt see this......:/ / []
Andrew: I don’t think we should hang out anymore. You’re convicted. But shall we take a stroll in the park? / []
Prince Andrew:  So? How do you think the interview went?   Everyone: 😬😯😦😮😧😵🤥🤭🤢🤮 / []
I wander if the prince try to stopped to upload this interview! / []
i have never in my life saw such a bad liar!! Wasnt there anybody to advise this poor b@stard? it feels like nobody prepared him to make at least believable statements. Jesus Christ! / []
what more proof do people need, everyone involved just needs to be sat down on a BIG luxurious table to satisfy their standards and then just get everyone’s story straight bc no one seems to “ remember “ LOL this is sooooooooooo crazy! / []
Anyone else think he had Epstein killed / []
There is alot wrong to that story, I dont even know where the bar is at tramp, I dont drink, I dont think I've ever bought a drink at Tramp every time I was there.  Ohh and I wasnt dancing there because I was on a dinner at a pizza hut.   Jeeze this is the best / []
looking at him, he's not tellin the true / []
There are so many clips in youtube about People lying or even so many psychiatrists who can realise when people lie, you can clearly see from his behavior, moving eyes, using words, sweating, etc.. But unfortunately once you have money, you always get away with lies and cheats, that's why Estate Agents are openly working!!!! / []
When will Emily Maitliss be going to The Palace again, this time to collect a well deserved honour for her outstanding services to broadcasting and journalism? / []
reminds me of Rahul Gandhi and Arnab Goswami interview / []
Delighted to have this interview he says haha / []
The IRA explode a boat with his uncle on it (which i think was wrong as they killed other people also) and he was fond of your boys also / []
" There's a slight problem with the sweating, I don't sweat I can't sweat, I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply...it was almost impossible for me to sweat.” - Prince Andrew / []
47:59  This really proves to me how he never saw any of this as morally bankrupt. What a soulless man, geez. / ['Sara Rossborough-Muhammad unfortunately he will never be out of money, given the fact he is the son of Queen Elizabeth II']
Would be so awesome if Chris Hanson did a to catch a predator on him / []
Who liked this interview / []
Andy.......Gloria is coming for Y O U .........  and   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ / ['Sara Rossborough-Muhammad Gloria Aldred.......ambulance chaser ...']
This pathetic excuse for a "man" has some audacity, talking about doing the "honorable thing"... Someone should show the world this "blueblood" bleeds red. It would be the only justice this mutt will ever face. / []

EDIT :  OHHHH im terribly slow   I see what you mean she 'Liked' her own comment!   \n   Personally I treat everyone I communicate with as if we are face to face, in my opinion decency should not be given a pass merely because we interact via the internet.  \n Thank you for your support here , greetings from Ireland  💚", '@a foolproof plan and an airtight alibi   Oh dear Yes,  I see what you meant in your comment before about this person.   \nNow that I have seen her all over the place making the same angry comments,  I must admit to feeling very confused & conflicted about this poor woman. \n  I feel she is a dis-illusioned later in life converter to Islam,  who is furious about how shes been treated all her life by men and the British church, by western society & thec "establishment".  \n I see very familiar things in the wording of her comments, the insulting accusations , saying everyone is scum & non muslims have ruined her life ,  that kind of focussed hate I have seen before in the journals & letters of very hurt people in the system , usually prisons & institutions I was involved with.  \n  I am irritated & offended by her attitude but I believe I see a very damaged woman lashing out at everyone in the only way she thinks she can...

He knew Epstein was convicted  in 2006 yet he went back in 2010 now why would he do that if there was no benefits lm sure Randy Andy never imagined this would  come to light. / []
He did it and we all know he did it! They tried to cover it up and failed the royal family couldn’t cover up that amount of evidence and photos even if they tried! The fact of the matter is he’s a P and It’s Proven as Fact he’s a P! / []

Everybody! Next time u decide 2 b tooooooo honorable to sb! Go stay at there place 4 few nights!!!!!!!😄😄😄 / []

Andy swears he couldn't have been the guy - Virginia Roberts recalled that she danced with him & he sweated profusely.

Wow…this dude really tried to use the “that’s impossible because I can’t sweat” defense even though there is photographic evidence!!  I guess decades of hiding behind mummies skirt doesn’t produce much intellect now does it? UNREAL AND PATHETIC. / []
He said going to Epsteins was not about partying  no it was about  abusing under aged young girls so now Randy Andy  has been caught with his pants down. / []
Holay this Prince Andrew has legalistic BS flying out the wazoo… / []
Andrew: Of course I slept with her. It was a convenient thing to do at the time. / []
The whole Santa if cult are pedophiles they have let this guy be in the limelight but they are all up to the same thing all of them / []
Can't wait to catch this moment in The Crown season 27 / []
Dude is a straight perv / []
Why so many dislikes? Do people not understand they're not disliking the prince but the efforts of those who provided the interview. / []
Check out body language 6:40 / []
Im getting the word… / []
he really can't say he knew nothing bc its his staff's job and the queen's staff job to know about the people they hang with he is not slick / []
When you’re IQ is 95 but you think your light from death note. / []
Bible study is answer to many questions. 😀 / []
Prince is innocent.Jury speaking. / []
You have to love the puke of york for continually digging his own grave....and he`s not done yet.  He should have pieced her off years ago but he let it snowball into an avalanche.  He is SO GUILTY and getting ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED in the meantime.  Looks so good on the dirtbag. / []
How isn’t this idiot not in prison? / []
A convenient place to stay!!!  Like you did not have the means to stay somewhere else?? / []
No guilt, No Regret, No shame. / []
🐂💩 / []
“I couldn’t have had sex with her, I don’t have a penis!” / []
That picture was taken upstair, I don’t believe I’ve ever been upstairs”. How does he know what upstairs looks like then? 🤷🏻‍♂️ / []
Becky Mc Donald from Corrie meets Prince Andrew. / []
If she was 17 in London and they had sex what is the problem exactly? Yea he was 41 at the time so was old enough to be her dad which is morally questionable but no law was broken and it's far from being a paedo. / ['She was trafficked homie', "@ahmedamjad6936 but it still doesn't make him a paedo."]
This guy is such tool. The way he down plays everything and back-pedals OMG -he has GUILTY plastered on his forehead. What an embarrassment to the human race😩 / []
An exceptional interview.  Well done Emily. / []
I did not dance I have no feet I did not dine I cannot eat I was home that night After a pizza party I wouldn’t forget  ‘Cause I cannot sweat And anyway  She is someone  Whom I’ve never met And it’s not my hand  On her bare torso ‘n tummy Because I simply  Was not there An’ if you keep this up I’m going to tell …   My Mummy.  Oh,  but Prince-y Boy,  you blink more than Hugh Grant and your face is more grey than the pavement outside Buck House. / []
absolute train wreck of an interview lies all the way through it / []
He shagged a minor?   I thought Baroness Thatcher closed all the mines. / []
Royal families are nothing other than deviant parasites that descend from a long line of criminals and perverts. This Pearl of Wisdom is another bright example. / []
He’s old and will go to hell soon / []
They just get away with it anyway. / []
https://youtu.be/CP0ikocfzkk this fool will sweat when the guillotine appears at speakers corner / []
give him a lie detector test-guilty / []
Now Andrew’s legal team is suing Virginia Giuffre for some specious claims. I assume to break her financially. Prince Andrew you have no honour or integrity. Whatever the outcome this will eventually affect his mental health. / []
But I thought he wasn't a good friend of ur yours  Y would u need to break it off in person if he wasnt of that importance to you / ['Exactly!']
What an injustice to this poor girl.  From my experience there is nothing worse than telling the truth and not being believed because the perpetrator is more powerful. / ['Well no one believes Andrew, so this isn’t really a very good example of that.']
How is this nonse not behind bars disgusting / []
Interviewer: you see there was a witness who saw you go into the house.  Dumb ass: you know what actually I did go into the house but it was to visit someone else in the house.  Interviewer: 😐 / []
This is total Beuractic BS ,period ...I'm 55, ok i may struggle with remembering something an hour ago , I mean petty things like a phone number or to pick up a particular brand of toothpaste ,,but I can remember every good ,no I'll not say good, I remember every person in my life, and when it comes down to a good looking lady ( girl then in this pic ,  who imo * was a gold digger*, she liked George Washington's face on green paper !!!! And went to that Beasts houses for 1 thing and 1 thing only , and that's not to go college !!!!) The Grand old Duke of york said it all ,,, ( had he had 10,ooo men ) he was out the navy , any service man , woman , you  are pumping full of Testosterone /  Estrogen , and any guy is like *A Tom Cat With 3 ___ks ,, If he's genuine ,ffs, god help our monarchy , he seriously has bad Dementia ! Own up, or Cough up , if you got zilch to hide get on ya private jet and face her in court , ( also, get a lie detector done on both of them  before our taxes pay for jet fuel  !! Fuel that soon will be much needed for vital important things like Vaccines and Food ,,,so *To the Duke , hurry up , your making me puke with anger , the body language tells it all , you GAVE HER 1 / []
This guys guilty as sin!! / []
“I never really felt the need to go PAUWTEEE” DBAG / []
The queens must be so proud of her sons lol / []
Emily deserves maximum respect for not calling him an outright rapist. Horrible example of privileged upbringing. I want to say bad things about this abhorrent creature… fuck i really do. But my own upbringing has taught me better. He has single-handedly kicked off the end of the Royal scourge that the UK has had to endear for far too long. No-one of reasonable mind could ever interpret this as anything other than it is - an absolute car-crash. “I have no recollection ever ever meeting her”. Sounds a bit “Clintonesque”. Let’s hope justice wins. It won’t. But hope is all we have against these monsters. / []
12:12 of course it was a convient place to stay. When you want to have sex with minors then going to hangout with a pedophile who has underage women by the bus loads at his house would probably be a pretty convient set up now wouldnt it / []
This defines that statement "I'm embarrassed for him" / []
I love this interview.  Every line is a gem. / ['That’s a bit of a stretch. 😆']
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 / []
Poor old Andy loves getting the leg over,so what,let him get on with it. / ['With children? 😡']
I hate to prejudge someone until proven guilty, but he looks as guilty as a puppy sitting next to pile of poo. / []
He's doing everything he can to be able to sweat again some day / []
Andrew saying "this lady" reminds me of Clinton saying "that woman." / []
It’s impossible that we had sex as I don’t have a cock. I lost it in the Falklands. Now I sweat only with BBC interviews. / []
This was excellent. What a scumbag / []
Peasant uprising ftw / []
Why do I keep coming back watching this? I’ve seen it so many times 🤷🏻‍♀️ / ["it's stunningly mesmerising.", '@Aceface101 I know right ? Lol']
He should be in the jail! he is clearly lying about everything! Any other person would be jailed straight away! Shame on the Royal Family for this piece of …. staying out of jail and not facing the charges for being with underage girl (probably many girls). I’m furious that this is not taken seriously! / []
Obviously innocent / []
He took Beatrice to a Pizza Express? To get "Cheese Pizza" I'm guessing. / []
And had 7 days to walk in park too the heat was on and they knew it / []
Of corse he would agree getting to hot / []
Yes there was in that 4 years contact / []
Nice walk in park so could not be herd from anywhere no inacentperson would do that walk in the park / []
Using his daughter for pizza he got staff to make pizzas how cowardly using that excuse / []
What a lier the country can see 5hat big time and the world / []
This is what a thousand years of inbreeding looks like. / []
“I’ve only been to Woking a couple of times.”  I guess he doesn’t travel in the same circles as the rest of us. 😆 / []
Above the law.  Like watching a car crash in slow motion.  Utter disgrace and totally delusional. / []
All bullshit ! / []
Innocent / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣😂']
What I do not understand,  why have there been no further claims from other people to claim Andrew, Duke of York is a sexual abuser ? / ["because they're dead"]
if you keep pressing 4 the duke sounds like a typewriter / []
He sure puts the pomp in pompous. / []
Reminds me of the R-Kelly interview 😂😂😂😂 / []
So you go ALL the way to meet someone for the SOLE purpose of telling him - while taking a walk TOGETHER in a park- it’s NOT appropriate to be seen together !! WOW!… actually it’s a STRETCH TO SOME EXTENT.. / []
At the end he says it would be possible to hide it from him if he stayed there  1 or 2 days. But then when he was there to break up his friendship-knowing what he did-he stays 4 days and has a dinner party. Weirdo / []
He is a liar / []
If it was a normal person he would be looking at years in jail...in his case the police have dropped the case fucked up world / []
There's honesty in the gutter / []
Lies were flowing out like wine from his mouth that even his heavy jowl wanted to detach from his neck. / []
His story doesn’t make sense - but he knows she can’t prove her story even though her story makes sense. / []
But I don’t even have a hand on that side of my body - I mean I didn’t at the time - it had fallen off; since then it’s grown back of course. / []
Can't wait for the Hollywood movie of Prince Andrew, played by Sir Michael Caine / []
2 years later, nothing, Nothing has happened to him or all the other sick fu*ks.  Rich don’t go to jail only the poor. Sad.  It will be like this until people wake up and pull themselves away from there phones sports etc and start coming together to change things. / []
Emily is loving this, every reply is golden. I don’t think anything will happen to him. But behind closed doors it will affect his health, the whispers, his daughters, the charities he’s head of. Kind Edward the seventh was just as bad. / []
Take a lie detector test Andy! As Cressida Dick said, no one is above the law. Yeah right... What a total lie!!!😵😠 The Police, the Tory Politicians and the famous Family taking up most of the space on the planet  seem to be above the  law and it is absolutely disgusting. So many stories around Paedophiles and the Royal Family. It really is no surprise. Why is it for the Metropolitan Police?  I am disgusted by the Police chickening out on not doing an investigation. They care nothing for Females. / []
THAT WOMAN IS A GOLD DIGGER. / []
Best comedy I have ever seen.  Just like a sewer- full of sh1t / []
It’s his total arrogance and utter contempt for the public that he thinks we’re naive, uneducated and stupid enough to believe him. / []
Guilty with a CAPITAL G! Mummy will protect him. When she passes (God forbid) Charles will open the kingdom doors for the popo  to come and retrieve him! / []
My fathers nephew was in the Queens Army and he said Andrew was the most obnoxious and ignorant man he had ever met and everyone in the army hated him and it was no surprise of this outcome / []
The queen must be so proud of her offspring / []
I like Prince Andrew...if you have a problem with that then go cry to your mommies. / []
He uses his friendship with Gislain Maxwell as being his defence. That’s not gonna look good when she gets done for sex trafficking kids. / []
He may have been a guest on the island, but that doesn't mean he knew what Epstein was up to. Cut the guy some slack. By the way, who are you all to judge? You speak as if you are holier than thou and have done no wrong. Bunch of hypocrites. / []
24:33 If you’ve never been upstairs where did you sleep? And how would you know it was upstairs if you’ve never been upstairs? 😆 / []
Is this the new normal ?  It’s ok to be an honorable idiot as long as you are an honorable prince ? 😂😂 / []
i love how obvious his tells are, man has guilty eyes. / []
Photoshoped teeth. This is your AL GORE #CIA #FBI #NCIS / []
Shame on Andrew for not giving the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. / []
Well the old saying is the Royal's can literally get away with murder. / []
She was 17 he a lyer / []
So that wasn't you getting a foot massage of a young Russian female........👀 Nooooooooooooo 🤣 / []
He don’t no we’re the bar is but he drinks there / []
He was saved the ass.... / []
this man dont have a job ,-) / []
He dont remember of that young girl but He remember of Litle things.... He is chiter.... / []
he 's not telling the truth ,   suiside of Epstein is not caused his death , secret service Killed him bicouse of Chain of prostitution in high profile politicans and power people ...and the truth Was in Grave with Epstein.... / []
Guilty / []
Àften / []
Who is flaire / []
Like fuck / []
Ah but don't it might be interested in love / []
"I do not recallect."  Oh yes, you do remember very well! / []
Whatever happened to the metro movement. Charges have been dropped againt this man which is no consolation for his accuser. / []
Wow. Convenient place to stay. All the places in New York. I don't believe him at all. / []
Prince Andrew is a noncey guy / []
My god he's so dumb...whoever authorised or suggested him to be interviewed in such a way must be fired because it was one of the worst decision EVER. You can't convinced people that water is not liquid. / []
If this guy was born in a council estate he would be selling weed at the local pub. Quite badly as well.   Really highlights how the class your borne in to really sets you up for life. No talent needed, just breath and turn up. How can this guy have had so many prestigious jobs representing UK? / ['It truly is both baffling and also terrifying that these hereditary positions of untold wealth and prestige still exist, and that amoral halfwits effectively act as our overlords, while we toil the fields. Good heavens save us', 'Sara Rossborough-Muhammad I don’t know what they get up to behind closed doors, but this interview shows this guy is not very intelligent.']
I just finished the Epstein netflix series and now Im here for more entertainment / []
He was a plus ➕one ffs 🙈😂🙈😂 can't listen anymore scum bag / []
After watching "The Death Of Stalin" a few days ago, I spent the first 10 minutes imaging, for fun, that Epstein was a political prisoner shot for "revisionism", and Andrew was being interrogated by the NKVD because he was his friend, and forced to denounce him like how Molotov denounced his wife haha. / []
Interviewer: "...but you were staying at the house of a convicted sex offender" Andrew: "It was a convenient place to stay"  C A S E  C L O S E D. / ['IKR. Not even a Homeless person would stay in a convicted sex offenders house to not sleep on the street.', '@Lyons_T-BAG How do you know that? I am sure you would have done the same. Now you want to act all self righteous.', '@davidtheboxer-777 Ah yes. The ROYAL PRINCE cannot find a comfortable place to stay.', 'Convenient because it was stocked with young girls', 'Of course  its a convenient  place to stay  free sex is on the menu.']
Oh deary me what a complete car crash. How did he know that photo was taken in London as he says it was yet he also categorically confirmed he never met the person involved or had the photo taken. Where else might it have been taken then? What a tangled web he has weaved for himself has he not? Great job by Emily Maitlis in ensuring he hung himself out to dry albeit she did not have to try that hard did she really? / []
It's fascinating watching someone try to figure out what someone who was telling the truth would say in real time, especially when they are really bad at it. He clearly thinks very highly of himself and I wonder how how many people strongly advised him not to do this interview. I hope everyone affected by his actions are eventually able to get closure. / ['He was advised to do the interview. I also read he sacked the person who advised him.', 'His media advisor resigned after failing to talk him out of doing the interview.']
The amount off people that has been shot at in the world 🌎 a wonder if there sweat is back on yet 🙈 / []
Well looks like Prince Peado will have to give evidence after today’s ruling in the US watch the scumbag try and get out of it using his scumbag lawyers to wriggle out of it. / []
After watching this, I'm pretty sure everyone is now convinced how guilty this dude is. What a train wreck! 😂😅 / []
Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial is coming up soon,I guess she will talk about him / ['About time!! When does it start?', 'Waiting for this to happen.', '@veronikaw2627 They said before the end of the year', '@mrhaltstop2294 Thank you!']
Would have been more convincing if he pretended to have dementia 😆 / []
O dear / []
Queen: 'My son, are the allegations true?' Andrew: 'this never happened mum and I will prove it to you!'  Does BBC interview / []
Despite being completely unconvincing of his innocence, Prince Andrew also manages to be condescending and patronising. If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I couldn't have believed it. / []
At 02:07  this in my opinion is Prince Andrews way of saying if im going to get in trouble for this im going to take all these people with me..." you would meet academics, politicians,  people from the U.N, a cosmopolitan group of US eminence"... This is why Prince Andrew will never go to court over all this / []
He must face justice ! / []
30:14 why is that so difficult to answer? / []
He should be invited to US ... picked up at his home by delta force navy seal just like that famous osama bin laden operation in pakistan. shouldn't be that hard. / []
Royal pervert they all freaks / []
Ive never heard a more convincing confession in my life / []
16:34 LISTEN TO THE TONE OF HIS VOICE when he quickly says yes and no to these 2 questions lol sounds like those answers should be switched!!! / []
Lol..never went there for partying..ya..he was meditating there for nirvana / []
Who made this weasel a prince???? / ['His mother. He is Elizabeth’s favourite']
Let's be honest, you don't get a Royal who knows what's what, you wouldn't be Royal if you did. But how clueless do you have to be to think a 4 day break up from a pedophile is "normal", the Queen must lament at what an idiot she has brought into the world. That's their problem, but there are victims who need justice and we should bend over backward to deliver, and change what is acceptable in this world. Most normal people don't need to be told, why the "elite" do is extremely worrying. / []
He is lying!! So full of excuses, he has an excuse for literally everything!!! / []
I don't know what's more amusing, the fact he claims the victim never met him despite having a photograph with her or him saying the photo was taken upstairs but I've never been upstairs 🤣. Then how do you know what upstairs looks like my dude 🤣 / []
No factual evidence for how long???? No facts no Law no Liability... Talking is here say and presumptions.... Is the Alleged VICTIM DISEASED IN ANYWAY..... DON'T THINK SO... / []
His mother got him killed because for her little boy / []
I'm surprised he didn't just blame Meghan Markle for it. / []
Why is he still free though / ['Because the elites are above the law']
If he is totally innocent, as he claims, why is he not sewing Mrs. Giufre for dammaging his reputation? … / []
God he is such a Neek. The Alan Partridge of the Royal Family. / []
He keeps saying that he told Epstein he couldn't see him anymore because the police were involved, but nothing about having to end the friendship because he didn't want to be friends with a frigging paedophile. What the hell is that about? / []
Why don’t you tell the FBI these things so you can clear your name? / []
The fbi and mossad have all the tapes of them all banging kids.  Nothing will.ever come out. / []
I paid my licence fee just after this interview. / []
This stupid old pervert will take down the entire British monarchy, so sad that great institution is maligned by him. I feel so sad to see Her Majesty protecting her favourite son.. / []
The best bit is 29.16 to 29.25 it's horrendous / []
He needs to be in jail / []
my god this is a trainwreck... its so obvious he's making excuses and wants to look innocent. / []
That is the saggiest double chin I’ve ever seen / ['The chin and crooked tie distract me. 😆']
Problem of dangly bits. / []
This guy is a joker / []
Prince Andrew likes underaged girls that stupid man / []
Dinner parties “ That’s the But that I Remember “ Lol So the rest of it can’t remember anything  Shameful liar / []
This is a classic , he is literally the funniest shit I’ve ever seen! / []
jail him hes no different than anyone else / []
😂😂😂😂 Oi she’s interviewing this clown this guy lacked  110 times in this vid such bs explanation what circus is this fool apart of / []
liar, liar, liar, pants on fire! / []
When ever you feel a little Down  Watch this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
He says he never met the girl  And what about the picture where he’s hugging her? / []
13:40 / []
His body language tells a differnt story to whats coming out his mouth lier lol atleast Harry has more sence of his mother / []
This is the funniest car crash I've ever seen. No, we definitely shouldn't get rid of these idiots. They're good for tourism and to laugh at. / []
36:51 ‘push came to shove and the leaked’ something tells me there is Incriminating evidence out there / []
Isn’t the BBC meant to protect the royal family, they just helped dig a bigger hole / []
Well there is a photo, ‘tramp night club’, but prince Andrew was drinking 💧 water / []
Interviewer: “Here’s a shovel, dig yourself a hole to jump in” Andrew: “Don’t worry I’ll be knee deep in 5 minutes” / ['LOL!', '😂', 'Hahaha 😆', '😂😂😂']
Such a deep hole His Highness has dug for himself. / []
Oh Andy, Andy, Andy.......what shall we or should we do with your? / []
Ah... yes indeed: His Lowness looks quite relaxed and confident during this interview of truth seeking. / []
'But the little girls understand'. -Jim Morrison. / []
Lefty fake blonde Emily. / []
I'd say that the old (very bad) boy and grandee has dug himself quite the deep hole, eh what? / []
It's easy to tell that the truth is not on his side😠 / []
She was the perfect interviewer for the job / []
This gets funnier with each watching 😆. / []
He also liked to hang out with Peter Nygård... Might wanna Google him. / []
This interview really reminds me of the episode of who wants to be a millionaire with Charles Ingram, he would have no idea what the answer was until he was given the signal if it’s A, B, C or D. Then he’d have to muddle his way through explaining how the answer just suddenly came to him. The mannerisms are identical. / []
He is Innocent....... / []
Prince Andrew is James Bond... Relax... DELETE... / []
A park bench is a "convenient place to stay!" This interview is so cringe, it's like watching a zebra being mawled by a lion! 🤣👍 / []
Can't express my gratitude enough / []
I love 💘 prince andrew 💜 / ['Why? Have you ever met him?']
Do you think Andrew is reading these comments ? / []
natalie mattis is not a good interviewer, we need Martin Bashir back! / []
Looks a bit uneasy give him a lie dectector / []
I had to come back and watch this after the news about the Metro Police will not take any action in the case of Prince Pædo. / []
Oh my god he’s literally sooo bad at lieing I’m laughing my head off!! He said we spoke about what I’d done” I mean what he done” Omg 😂😂 / []
Pulls the same faces as Bill Gates in his interview. These pedophiles couldn't  lie straight in bed. Case dropped nothing suspicious here. What a joke. / []
This is almost as entertaining as the John Raunch interrogation / []
I wonder we meet again 🤔 / []
Lying Cant... / []
Seriously though this interview alone and all it implies is reason enough for the British to abolish the monarchy. You’ve given an entire family carte Blanche to abuse those they honestly believe to be beneath them. / []
Pizza express 🤔 that supposed to be some kind of code lol… / []
i dont drink / []
GUILTY / []
I think he is a good gentle man from a decent Nobel family.  ( Have a mercy on someone who has fallen from grace). / []
This is funnier each time I watch it. / []
Tom Cruise R. Kelley  Prince Andrew  add to the list of creepy/guilty interviews…… / ['Shia LeBeouf (Just Do It)\nJussie Smollett']
He's still free along with the woman who killed Harry Dunn. / []
Virginia Roberts is absolutely unpredictable she sold her self her money from the age of 15 till the age of 20 it’s all very well documented princess Andrew has never ever done anything illegal and Hugh in my opinion will be observed by the British police department and the FBI if they know what’s good for them. / []
what ppl have to understand is we are all human no matter how much money we have no matter how famous we r we all do things we all are attracted to ladies or men wateva takes ya fancy well and we can all hide it but it nomes out in the wash and its normal.i aint done it for alot of years but i can understand tbh i have never been to 1 of these t partys basicly a coke party isnt it i aint familiar with all this but i understand partys and the reason why ppl wanna no about these ppl doing drugs and paying prostitutes is crazy cos its normal most ppl have done it i aint i nearly did but i never and iff i did so what who cares not me and i wouldnt care iff some1 new even iff all my family new but when u go that little bit further and u bring boys or girls into the situqtion ans they are below the age of 18 then basicly there is a line that has been crossed ...i certainly wouldnt even stand withbsome1 who have been in jail for that stuff no way / ['Sara Rossborough-Muhammad i am i am stood on second floor how did u guess']
yanno when he says dinner partys...duz he mean sum1s house and theres a good chance there is upper drugs and ladies who are willing to undresh for money hahaha..basicly a coke party as we wouls say..he makes it sounds so normal a dinner party... / []
Rich people have it all poor have to die to they get they heavily wishes / []
Why does he laugh when Emily mentions Epstein's death? It happens a few times! / ['Responsible for it', 'Relief', 'Damn them']
It doesn't remember  meeting  Virginia  Roberts  he must have been unconscious  or he has amnesia conveniently  he didnt know where the bar was so he couldn't  ask someone  where it was most bars they come and ask what drinks you want. / []
Trafficked lol so on them long trips parents dont care passing cops at airports and people at partys and hotels close to 18 years old and she could not think what she was doing was wrong as she is a CHILD lol we remove citizenship in UK at 15 because they knew what they was doing and rightly so / []
He didn't  know  the police was investigating  Epstein  who else did he think it might be father xmas such an idiot he never was the sharpest tool in the box  not very clever  never done very well  at school it shows through  now how dim he is . / []
Stutter stutter stutter he could not articulate  himself  due to his lies it's  obvious  he is guilty he never had a title of party prince its a reputation  you earned  he is so pompous arrogant and devious just a horrible insignificant individual. / []
He had to think what he would say to her the thoughts crossed his mind. / []
Went to see him in person because he knew there was a possibility of phones being recorded. Also he made it seem like everything was about being friends with his wife then continues to say much about ending their friendship who is it him or her? You lying p.o.s! / []
Guilty and should be immediately charged / []
Prince Andrew is a child abuser that got away with it because he is white and has power. This whole country is full of racist police officers and has a government full of racist scum lead by a racist sack of shit Called Boris, yes the most racist white man in the UK is called Boris, a russian name from Bulgaria..... / []
Liar liar 🤥 / []
In this interview, Andrew appears to prove to himself that he is brave and therefore so will the public. Unfortunately, he manifests that he is NOT an  honorable man, I.e., he has no sense of God's value but that of the world. Epstein's friendship was special to him, not the young girls and women from whom he had had his self-gratification, reducing them to things to be used to release his basal needs. In fact, the US Court's sex trafficking charges on Epstein  was a non-issue to him. On the contrary his title in the Royal Navy was vital to him as his entitlement to the British monarchy. Titles, medals, entitlements - empty decorations - which he did not have to assiduously work  for, except for being a son of the monarch, are worthwhile to him! ANDREW LIES! ANDREW IS A DISGRACE! NO MAN IS ABOVE THE LAW! JUSTICE IS THE BATTLE CRY! GOD WILL PUNISH LIARS! THE CRIES OF SEX VICTIMS SEEK GOD'S JUSTICE! 🙏 / []
Polygraph test . Dead easy . Done . Don't understand why it's not been done. Scumbag / []
Maybe look in to her ,,you idiots  ,,ha ha / []
How is this yesterday’s news / []
Why does rich people get off with crime … it’s ridiculous / ['he eats at pizza express i eat better then him and im poor']
Throw him in jail he's absolutely disgusting!! / []
He is so despicable …. / []
TOO MANY HAPPY PILLS IS WHAT I WAS GETTING FROM PREVIOUS SWARTZ AFRIKANOS SOUTH AFRICAN GUARD.  TOO MUCH DRUGS IS NO GOOD FOR ANYBODY.  TOO MUCH LOVE DRUGS MAKE ONE HOSTILE OVER TIME AS WELL, RAVERS. / ['EXCESSIVE DRUG USE TRANSFERS PROBLEMS THROUGH BIRTH TO NEXT GEN HEIRS AS WELL.']
This should be shown in cinemas before every film as an example of what a car crash looks like. / []
He speaks like a guilty person. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who visited pedo island is guilty, there's no way people didn't know what was going on! / []
Happy it has been resolved for yous got to be careful the company you keep put it down to experience and moove on best a luck for future 🙏 / []
What do the police in the UK even do?!?! Seems sus. Oct 11, 2021 / []
He really has no clue how bad of a liar he is. / []
Just a straight forward shooting weekend, you idiot / []
Foolish for Prince Andrew to grant an interview. Nothing he can say can help him.  The police cannot prosecute because the minions of the media are offended by sordid behaviour. The accused has to have broken a law enacted by Parliament. The relevant law is the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which raised the age of consent for prostitutes to 18.  The putative complainant was over the age of 18 in 2003. Did she give consent as set out in the 2003 Act? Did she give consent  before 2003 when the age of consent for prostitutes was 16 and she was 17?  There is the rub. How does a judge and jury decide on 20-year old evidence that the alleged victim did not give consent? And it is no good saying that no prostitute gives consent. Because prior law and the 2003 Act presume that prostitutes do give consent. The onus is upon the prosecution to rebut this presumption. The Met Police know that the rules of evidence present an obstacle that cannot be overcome.  The same laws that protect ordinary people also protect the rich and mighty. Knock down the law to get at the Devil and none of us could survive the whirlwind that would follow. / []
The Queen has done herself much harm in giving him shelter. Lost any respect I had for her. / ['To be fair, she’s his mother so it’s only natural she wants to defend her son. The whole royal family should be dismantled and taken out of the spotlight']
I'm embarrassed of how bad he is at lying / []
Nothing to see here, move along / []
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  The kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it. / ['And this is relevant how exactly?']
The interviewer cannot believe the answers he is giving... Such a terrible liar and can't believe he can be a decent diplomat! The RF need to keep him out of circulation now. / ['The Royal Family are fully backing him. The British ruling class is full of pedophiles and people who protect those wealthy pedophiles']
Yeah, you had to go to Epstein’s home to tell him you can’t see him any more. Unless you had something to hide why would you do that? This is not a good story, Prince. / []
How is this possible lol.. what am I watching? Is he actually real? Am I on something? It's like someone put all the typical lie detection clues into a single person and just set them free to roam a grand dillusion. / []
He never felt the need to go potty?  hah ha ha / []
He can’t say the picture is fake lol / []
I've never partied. I bought a porn star into the palace.  Several pieces of press photo evidence counter that statement. Jeffrey Epstein Jimmy Savile Stuart Hall. Rolf Harris and now Hue Edwards.  .All figments of fevered imaginations / []
“Why would she be saying these things?”  …. Probably cus she’s hoping to get millions out of it! Why does Virginia Roberts get to make an accusation and it be taken as gospel!! She clearly has something to gain from making this up. Money. / []
At the moment I'm watching this is already a year after and I'm surprised they let him go on, this dude is thick af and it feel like a bad joke.  So with all the hotels available and all the money that he had a paedo's house it's still more convenient? But then you think about it and it seems legit because hotels don't have what Epstein had: kids on demand / []
"I admit fully th-th-th-that my judgement was probably coloured by my ummm... tendency to be too honourable. But thats just the way it is" 🤔 / []
Prince Andrew doesn’t sweat. That would imply that he works hard. He’s never worked a day in his life. Now the proper term that should have been was perspire.  That he does do without lifting a finger.  Sort of like Clinton saying he “never inhaled” /did drugs or “had sex” with Lewinsky. Funny how these “elites” all have the same technicality with their lies and all apparently hang out in the same circles. / []
Honestly I still get MAD and shockingly disgusted even when watching this interview after a long time. It dumbfounds me that he is so previliged , living in an ivory tower that he doesn't even understand the sheer magnitude of what he's being accused of . He thinks he's being accused of a " Charles and Diana " scandal , but my goodness he's being accused of paedophilia.  Such obscene previlage that allows such people not to even fear consequences should not exist. / ['And the girl was 17 too - why not just stick to 18 and older - it’s easy enough to do.', '@pauljohnson842 Could have had any 18 year old he wanted but No ....I guess 18 is too old . Absolutely DISGUSTING . he should face his crimes and stop hiding under mummys skirt.', '@nelsonsibiya9204 age of consent in UK is 16.', 'Yall really think he only raped the 1 girl? Your so gullible he went to eipsteins island plenty of times and probably got plenty of minors that he raped and abused he should be getting life without parole', '@Delicious_Oreoz no one is accusing him of rape.']
This is comedy gold, I’ve watched it 4 times now. So he hasn’t seen or had contact with Epstein the entire time he was in jail but felt it necessary to fly to NY when he was released, stay with him for several days, attend a dinner party, walk with him in Central Park, all to explain why he had to end the friendship. Who does that?? This interview should be a case study in every journalism and criminal justice class. Emily Maitlis is a star! / ["I just watched this for the first time and it's making me frustrated for the victim.", 'Agree!', "That bit hit me as farcical. Wonder why he did though? If it was damage limitation he wouldn't have stayed", 'I have watched the his pathetic individual a half a dozen it was the honorable thing to do. Does he think everyone listening to his rediculous interview think we are all stupid?🤔🤔', '‘We cannot be friends anymore…so after this holiday at your home, after this dinner party, after our walk in Central Park, after not getting any more massages….I will not be seen in public with you anymore….ever.’   This interview will sink him.']
From serving in Her Majesty's Armed forces to serving in Her Majesty's Prison. / []
4th time watching this. It’s a pure masterclass in lying. It’s almost painful to watch someone unravel like this. I don’t know about you, but I always go and spend 4 days with someone when I break a friendship up. Andrew you lying sack of s**t. 😂😂😂 / ['🤣 yeah it’s great, I love it']
I love the Royals but man ur  are so Guilty. Anyone who does this to othere human being is sick and most of them get away within horrible crime. It is not its right and they should be jailed for life. / []
Feels like JCS should make an analysis of this interview, gonna be gold / ['They did. Its since been taken down, but you can still watch it through various react vids.']
What a brilliant journalist / []
Thick, interbred, pompous, arrogant, debauched, self serving imbecile and that is enough adjectives  for now to describe this lying piece of work / []
There is space in R Kelly cell, he can’t even get his lies right!!! / []
Lies lies lies / []
Would have loved to see him after this in his private moments  Oh Andy dear boy what a complete cockup / []
Emily  should get a knighthood  for this performance  she was simply  an amazing interviewer. / ['That would be ironic given she basically exposed the son of the Head of State here 🤣', 'Emily will be lucky if she stays alive 😅', 'The Queen’s favourite son. Careful Her Majesty doesn’t trip as she’s knighting her', 'In his verbosity he says nothing, in her silence she says everything!', '@jeanettesteed3326  when she asked some questions  he never gave an answer  he created  another question.']
Stutter  stutter  stutter he cant engage  his cabbage  of a brain  quickly  enough  he doesn't  know where he collected  the title  as a party prince you idiot  its not a title  it's  a reputation. / []
I don't sweat. I just glisten! / []
It's all Trumps fault, they are confusing me with Trump, Trump was the gang banger never me never me. / []
I cant sweat when being shot at either only when i run away i cant explain that 🤔 thats what photograhs are for to remember 🤣 / []
Liar, will get away coz he is a royal. / []
This guy in my mind is in the ranks of Saville and Rolf Harris he makes me feel sick. I’ve met Queen she’s a lovely person I’d never want to met this guy he is not good. / []
Within 48 hrs ,the normal person must've said to him ,' you better watch that again' , if I were you ,he has and within 48 hrs he stepped bk from royal duty ,that's your guilt there ,even though his charities were walking away from him ,mental health issue for me he says ,of course it is ,all pedos have mental health issues  ffs !!!!!!!!!!! / []
This interview is part of the Evidence Against Randy Andy  😂🤣😀 / []
" it was a convenient place to stay" the worst statement in the whole interview. / []
Wined, dined and probably 69, made himself look guilty as f^~% / []
Sorry i am not a sheep, i do not believe all i read as i have learnt in life its most likely not all as reported, i have read all and do not believe this women who in many new pictures her handlers are trying to make her look like an innocent child, all i see is a cash hungry women with no other means to get Big Dollar, the women was 17 my son was in army at 17-years-old no Child!. the women kept going to meet all Epstein herself time after time after time end of story. O now there is a advanced in age African american lady with nice hair claiming she witnessed something, this is all just turning in to a great big cash hunt. / []
This interview is proof that being born rich does not make you smarter or better in any way, despite what they'd like you to believe. Before this interview Prince Andrew was just another high profile person who just happened to be picture with Epstein at high society events, most people didn't have an opinion on it and weren't aware of it, after this interview he became public enemy number 1, purely because his ego thought he had the intelligence, power and charisma to make it go away by bullshitting his way through an interview with the BBC. / []
All that money and still he has shithouse teeth / []
“I’m carrying on with what I do “ !  Sweet fanny adams !!! / ["He's got 3.5 million people that have got a badge, what more do you want? This idiot is on a different planet."]
He's so gross that I find this hard to watch for more than a few minutes. / []
his mum the Queen must have cringed at this / []
at times he looks as tho he wants to throttle her / []
To bring groups men to have sex wth young girls !!! Pimp Epstien!! / []
Let’s face it the 17 yr old going on 30 was paid for a service she a scam artist who only wants more cash dream on hunny I understand you took a deal already your a disgrace to women who were violated most women who are SA don’t have a photo smiling with the perp. / []
Well I couldn’t of had sex because I have a rare condition where I don’t actually have a penis. Well I do now but I didn’t then, it’d actually been taken away, well borrowed, by a rhinoceros on a safari in Woking. But luckily he actually returned it to me in an email last Tuesday / []
All these questions he should've been hooked on the lie detector test 😒 very thick skin mate / []
she is a fantastic giornalist not oprah / []
well, that was a bit of a tight spot for his highness. thankfully, his actions were always "colored by a tendency to be too honorable" and his recollection of all "unbecoming positive action" is sketchy -- to say the least. LOL / []
His eyes try and suggest the appearance of skepticism, as if to say, we should believe he is surprised at hearing these crazy questions and that he is being honest. / ['Andrew the lyer lyer bums on fire I bet his bum is very sore by now its been burning  burning burning the liar liar liar, and to think the public works hard to keep that waster with theer taxes they pay for that lout']
Talks about this being hard on him and a “mental health issue” in order to try and get sympathy without ever thinking about how hard it must have been on his and Epstein’s victims.  The guy is a liar and a creep. / []
This interview is literally the definition of digging your own grave. / []
Is this his way of compromising by way of public shame rather than being brought before the justice system and US investigators despite verbally stating on video that he would co-operate if he were asked? / []
There couldn't of been a better interviewer she was simply amazing. / ["She's amazing I thought she's an investigator lol"]
Its your  reputation not a title you old fool / []
Charles to Andrew: bro, you improved my Public image, thanks! / []
...with the words of Monty Python, "My Brain Hurts!" / []
Lock Him Up / []
I cant believe he said he stayed in epstein house because that was the only way to get hold of epstein and talk to him.  And this is Andrew, the son to Queen Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia, New Zealand etc...and Head of 50+ commonwealth countries. / []
Oewwww! 🍵 🫖 🇬🇧 / []
Andrew thinks he can talk his way out of this. Because mummy has money / ['*mummy has power']
Liar / []
Do you regret this friendship, now no. No self awareness or empathy towards victims. / []
A man with such a power, influece, connections and nothing serious to do in life could be jumping from one hobby to another.  Sex is such an easy toy for the wealthy and rich that anything could have happened, but certainly he was in the middle of some of the events of interest for investigators. / []

Thank you for leaving the comment section open 👍 / []
every time I watch this it gets worse / []
His genially  posture and answers for the camera were intended to deflect the attempts of Emily to get an angle on him.  But, God bless the House of Windsor for trying. / []
His security detail should be able to collaborate his movements??? / []
Why is he laughing so much? / []
The more I watch this the more I believe him / []
Epstein was “in and out all over the place” - you might wish to rephrase that, Andy! / []
There's no proof that Prince Andrew was in those locations where Giuffrè addressed him as hers rapist. She is doomed to lose and pay the legal consequences of it. The photo of Virginia Giuffrè Roberts, Duke of York, and Ghislaine Maxwell is a forgery. There are plenty of evidences that prove it, and it has been debunked by an Italian News Portal. / []
Guiffre´s scandal has the power to bring down the whole monarchy. Prince Andrew is just a scapegoat in all of this. Question is why do you believe this yacht girl, she had every opportunity to to walk away, & make the complaint when it happened, she wasn't underage. She thinks because he's a Prince she can get a good payout. Parents couldn’t handle her. She ran away aged 13 and was then a street kid who was put into prostitution. It’s not ok to be a prostitute then accuse your clients of assault and complete a witch hunt by media. I find curious is that if Guiffre said she was sexually abused by PA 3 times, why did she get anywhere near him after the first time. A person is innocent until it they have been proven guilty, at this time it is purely accusations that have been brought forward. Thereˇs no evidence he broke any laws. Guiffre was above the age of consent in the UK and in NYC. She was above the age of consent at the time anyway, she was paid for her 'services´. Why did the police do nothing for decades about all the minors Epstein deflowered himself? Please, stop infantilising this woman. She is responsible for her poor choices. She was not a child. / []
Queen Elizabeth,  it's time to turn your grandson over to the law.   Turn yourself in Andrew.   The world is sick of media exploitation and child molestation.   Our children deserve better from the world's media.   Disgusting behaviour.   Do we have to hear about it everyday in the news with total explicity about what your Prince Andrew is charged with.   Please Queen Elizabeth, the world knows to stay away from that guy.    Live Long And Prosper / []

He's quite clearly lying you can tell / []

How evil the Royalfamily is when They protects a pedophile and , not an innocent black woman. / []
He's scandal could fall the whole royalfamily apart , but there are obessed with Meghan&harry and ignoring and protecting Andy's pedo scandal. The royalfamily is evil and must be abolished / []
What a lot of crap. He should have been royally trained to lie. / []

Can you imagine how different his side of the story would have been without those photos being in the public domain / []

Where is Peter Sellers when we need him?  "Due to a medical condition, it appears that I have lost the ability to sweat."  "That's definitely me in the photograph--but it's a photograph of a photograph of photograph and that's not my hand on whatever that is!" / []
A bad sign about our world. That a man like Epstein is capable of bringing together a great number of academics, royals, wealthy businessmen, and politicians.   How massive is this network of pedophiles and their facilitators? / []
You weren't known as "Randy Andy" for nothing you lying lowlife. / []
It was just a straight forward shooting weekend……Ha! / []
Guilty ! stop the shit, you are guilty ! the faces he pulls makes me laugh, - pervert ! / []
He's a liar and not a good one he's making it worse for himself prick. / []
Of course it was the medias fault leave the king alone.what about the droit de cuissage. / []
“It was a convenient place to stay” yeah I’m sure it was mate / []
Never seen someone make themselves look so guilty. / []

Let's see PROOF OF PAYMENT from PA and PE for the meals at Pizza Express on the date and time in question! / []
He thinks the grown ups listening are going to believe his tales of woe. Next he'll be saying it was an accident that he tripped and fell on top of the girl. / []
A railway station !! that was his house was like ???? allot of girls it sounds like !!!he had to see him to get rid of evidence ! / []

I'm baffled as to why he did this. Total disaster for him. He looks guilty as hell. / []
Maybe if you pay enough money to the whole world people start believing.... like the reporters believe in good police work in australia / []
Reptillian / []
Oh my … 60 min digging his own grave … / []
What a bit of luck for this lying little creep, that Epstein is dead, so cannot refute any of the lies that are spilling out of his royal mouth. / []
Non recollection is not the same as no I did not. There a lot at steak here the man has to stand his ground but this interview is peeling with denial. / []
The law protects the rich,never forget that! / []
I don’t like to paurtee either pedorew / []
i wonder how many minutes into the interview it took before he realized he had fucked up, because he talks like a man thats lying his ass off. / ['I dont think his pompous ass realised he was in hot water until the queen started taking away his titles']

He is not a good friend but he flew over to break off the friendship   what a load of horse shite   an embarresment at the least / []
lol start remembering😆😆😆 you are not having Alzheimers😆😆 / []
Absolutely beautiful / []
He's a bad man and a bad liar / []
Liar. There are sooooooo many red 🚩 🚩 🚩  Once you know a liars ability to divert the truth you cannot unsee it.  Mumbles, chops & changes his explanation, over blinking his eyes when he's answering,  uses his hands to explain simple things in order to make him look educated (he's not) he's an entitled creepy man who needs to own up. I REALLY hope they have video footage of e.v.e.r.y person who came to their homes and had sex with these poor woman. (GIRLS! at the time) They all need to go down.  It'll be very interesting to see what Ghislaine speaks out. I have a feeling smell deny it all and say she was coerced & in an "abusive" relationship 🥴 / []
I am surprised Bill and Hillary Clinton haven't arranged Ghislaine Maxwell's suicide yet. / []

P.a: No i never seen or met her in my life. Usa: these are your court papers to attend the court. / []
The your royal highness part at the end was my favorite part where she genuflects with her head.  As an American, I’m not calling anybody “Your royal highness”. Lest what was the Boston Tea Party for? Here in Alabama we call that blue blooded, bull-spit. / []
Prince Andrew had Jeffrey Epstein Prince Charles had Jimmy Seville !!! / []
Prince Andrew helped the UK in the Falklands through his brave actions. How can we desert him now when the blackmailing nonsense is insulting his integrity? Prince Andrew stands accused of sexual assault by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says that the assaults happened that she was a minor. She claims it happened at different times and days in various different locations, to where she flew on private jets with all the luxuries and got paid. Guiffre lived an hedonistic lifestyle like these girls did, slept with many rich men, while being flown all over the world and being paid for it. Men never do a photo with prostitutes. Her alleged photo is a fake. The age of consent in NYC is 17. She was not a minor. Moreover Guiffre was never pretty she should have gone to speck savers. / ["Your Highness, is that you there trying to save what's left from this train wreck?😂", '@ohadabrahami5345 Ha, ha. I unlike you prefer fair play. Prince Andrew is innocent.']
he did it / []
The good news is, Virginia cured him of his inability to sweat. / []
He’s so specific about things he wants to remember, then in the same breath, he has no recollection of anything. His body language is screaming that he’s lying through his teeth!! / []
Oh mommy mommy I've been framed for doing something I promise have not done / []
He needs a good ole flogging / []
Just goes to prove the saying is true,lifes like a shit sammich,the bread you have the less shit you have to eat. / []
How did he know it was upstairs if he’s never been upstairs. He’s just proved himself guilty. / ["We could assume this is something people had told him, but yes - why did he even bring it up? The interviewer didn't mention it, we know the upstairs is where the bedrooms would be.... I thought it strange he mentioned it as it is somewhat incriminating. The guy is clearly lying his head off the whole time"]
How did he know it didn’t happen if he has no recollection! / []
So much for looking out for children who are abused! He never saw anything! He’s a rubbish liar. / []
"...he had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together." Oh yep, I'd call them extraordinary all right, twisted, demonic, evil and psychopaths, but extraordinary all the same. / []
This is possibly the greatest piece of TV 📺 I have seen. Worth the TV License. She sat there and destroyed him with little effort. Who advised him to do this ? What an arrogant pompous liar 🤥. / ["She did not destroy him. Prince Andrew destroyed himself with his answers. I wonder how he is going to answer if this case goes to trial by jury in the  USA and the cunning ,foxy, sharky prosecutors attack him with answers....If this interview was a disaster I just wonder how it is gonna be if he ever has to answer in court. Paying close attention to what he says and what is coming out from Maxwell's case I think he was trapped by Jeffrey and his clan. That Maxwell wanted to befriend him and introduce him to Jeffrey was not a coincidence."]

02:10 Cosmopolitan Group of Pedos… 👍🏻 / []
Your mother Andrew, would not be happy with your tie / []
What this person has been accused of is just the tip of the iceberg, it goes much deeper and more terrifying than anyone can imagine. / ["Spot on!  Narcissists have a liking for the young and the vulnerable, there are just TOO MANY red flags with regards to the 'royals' past and present.\n\nCharles spent MUCH more time with 'uncle' Saville than Andrew ever did with Epstein, they were raised by Mountbatten who is 'alleged' to of been 'fond' of young boys.\n\nThen there's Charles close friend the rev Peter Ball, he even provided him with the house he was 'alleged' to have committed his abuse, he was critisised at the abuse enquiry for his 'misguided support' it is also quite likely to of been 'Charlie boy' who protected Saville making him pretty much 'untouchable'\n\nThere's also 'Edward Heath' no wonder Saville felt so 'secure' no wonder he was 'untouchable'\n\nThere are many 'red flags' so who knows what we haven't heard of, what has been paid off or brushed under the carpet, the big issue for Andrew is this is coming from overseas, much harder to cover up and wipe clean."]
A dirty little prince from a dirty little family 🤮 / []
‘There’s just one problem. I’m not really here’ / []
Basically these rich powerful people can lie and theres not a damn thing you can do about it / []
As it were... / []
The only way to explain this disaster is that Andrew completely overestimates his own abolities and intelligence and  is unaware how real people think and behave. / []
OMG! / []
Andrew committing professional suicide on national television. / ['Great idea! 😁']
Let's party on Little St.Jeff's! / []

Great Interview, this lady has Balls. / []
Is He still free?! Because that men belongs to jail! / ['Yeah of course the queen is still saving his sorry arse']
I dont know why I watch this whenever it crops up on my feed....but each time it gets more horrific than the last / []
I am giving thiss a thumbs up simply for the interviewer. This is hands down one of the best interviewers I have ever seen, hats off to Emily Maitlis. I just watched the breakdown of this by "The Behavior Panel", it is brilliant, go and watch it, it is even more entertaining than the original. / []
His crooked tie alone screams he’s been abandoned by the family. Any aide had they been around him before the interview would have adjusted that for him. / ['Has he developed the stutter of his grandfather']
Actually watching this again a year later. I think he did really well in this interview under the circumstances. Very difficult questions. / []
why this guy is so important ? / []
"I don't do public displays of affection" Only behind closed doors with 17 years ya dirty old man 🤢 / []

He could of rang him and said this is moypark chickens here you have to ebstain abstein  chuck chuck chuck Look you are losing feathers the girl seen leaving ebstain house after ebstain in white jacket looks from 11 to 13 years old never mind 17 years being viol enough maybe it was his security took the photo as they were disgusted also.

His judgment was coloured by his tendency to be too honourable! Psychopaths, what are they like, amiright... / []
Anyone else smell a ton of bullshit / []
Unbelievable / []
From the Royals point of view, how the hell did they let this go ahead? It was really ‘preordained’ to be a disaster. Even though Prince Andrew may have unwittingly exposed quite a bit, he would have been better, if only for his own sake, keeping his mouth shut. And imagine the Queen watching this / []
He is awful as a liar XDD / []
Just 5 mins in when he says, "it was just a straightforward shooting weekend..." - the viewers start to turn against him / []
What does the Queen know? If she knows the details of Prince Andrew's involvement, that is also a crime. As the highest figure in the Westminster Court System and the laws to which all in the British empire follow with fear of penalty, Her Majesty is knowingly harboring a criminal. What is Scotland Yard doing? They have been given a complaint and done nothing to investigate... This whole situation is being kept hush at the bequest of the Queen. / []

I love you Prince / []
And now   He’s been served papers in many forms multiple times   Effectively ignoring it   That makes him guilty in my opinion   The grown up version of sticking his fingers in his ears and going LALALALA   I hope they serve fois gras and pheasant in jail you probably paedophilic prize-winning prick!  And by the way, hats off of the BBC, for allowing the comments section on this   Trial by the masses   I don’t recall having seen anyone protesting his innocence here / []
I never saw who was coming or going hahaaaaaaaaaaaa / []
Bet the queen was sitting in the spare room next door ……….shitting herself… / []
He must be incredibly thick to not have had the instinct to get out of that set up / []
Personally I think he's innocent, although he may have had sex with her at some point of her own free will (in his eyes) and without knowing her true age and that she was trafficked. I believe him. / ['Not the sharpest knife in the draw are you.', "@stanstan7426 I take you are razor sharp like crocodile Dundees knife?😄 awww bless.....you can't cope when someone doesn't have the same opinion as the majority clearly.", '@dantheman81811 l think you will find that the majority understand that someone who hides behind Mummies Skirt in a Scottish Castle probably has a reason for this cowardly action.']
No there is no good time ever to talk how a head of the government became friends with known paedophile that was supplying the high life with little girls. I wish he goes to hell this old fart. We do not have to see what was he doing to know and anything he says is irrelevant. / []
28:08 you can see him stop smiling and start thinking about those days / []
What an imbevile / []
He knows full well he done it and that is 100% the reason he won’t go to America 😡 vile 🤮🤮 / []
You would think that a Prince of the realm would get his tie straight before appearing on camera for arguably the most important interview of his life. I could do that when I was 6 for school! If he is sloppy about something like that,  what else is sloppy? His memory perhaps? His ethics? / []
I dont believe any thing he says he knows more  than hes saying so many lies and i guess he will get away with it it doesnt seem fair / []
String the lot of them up I say / []
I had a medical condition which meant that I didn't sweat - Prince Andrew. / ['It’s called “Prince Andrew syndrome” 😂']
Question to u all. Have seen comments on meghan called yacht girl. Has she met this evil epstein too. / []
😬 / []
worst liar of all time / []
Absolute train wreck. / []
People in Palaces shouldn't suck toes / []
Could he have not known her age? The drinking age in the UK is 18, so I could see him assuming she was older. / []
Lol wth is this guy saying / []
Did he just say he doesn't sweat?! What's next you don't poop either? Ok north Korea. / []
I'm ashamed of calling you by your title your same as Jimmy Saville and rolf Harris  Your gona get convicted as you are guilty of the charges Good riddance / []
I find you to be so untrue.  Your actions betray you. / []

👍🍀🍑😉👶🍀✨🍑 *Please Read* No wonder we screwed as humans.. As these so called 🙄  "honorable people"  cannot get that 'Virgin Addict"  out of their head and have the younger girls be some sort of a "Thrilled in their lives Then W hat does the rest of us do .. to get the "world rid of these damaging people that are doing this! 'Cuz   .damn.. there's so many of them  the list is going into the millions of guys that have the virginity at it affects to them.. that purest of looks that they can only come off if this is the thing that they like the most and now they can control it!  Men do that virginity of a young girl.. with a pretty face and  A slender body obviously .. they were going for the same type but different colors of it!  That I did notice of the girls. .that are the "Victims . .That have come to accuse these people involved JE.GM.PA.Etc... But we never see women do this to younger men! On the contrary we have more of a motherly instincts to protect then harm especially sexual.... I always get nervous sometimes if I meet people that don't have children .. Or Rich/Money .. they seem a bit off in their ways! Where do they lose that that humane part of them ... that they should not wrestle with.. especially if you have money  you obviously should have a better insight of yourself .. but not as a source of  harming and others! These actions are just as  Corrupt as  *The Corrupt Business of*  *Children Protective Services*  in the United States where they can take your child ..yes sadly / scared f you're especially low income because they think you're doing something bad and these Ms have done this plenty of times in the US today read about that also people that has to do with being victimized and your children and another aspect! The government is trying to help these people and they have all that police in yet those same police go out the low income families in some ways they are connections!

He should face trle just lkke every other human this that was so.e off the street they would be flyed out to America / []
This man is CLEARLY innocent!!! Why do people WANT him to be guilty when he’s NOT!!!    Says no one lol / []
This is absolutely hilarious.  Can’t get enough of watching it.  Should be a sketch on SNL!! / []
Doesn't remember being in a photograph but remembers what he had for dinner 20 years ago / []
Yeah he's definitely guilty / []
Just a straight forward shooting weekend with a couple of young girls thrown in for good measure. This guy is absolutely pathetic. / []
"Hey Mom, it went well, non?" / []
I went out to see him to tell him is was inappropriate for us to be seen together 😂😂😂 have you not heard of a phone or WiFi? / ["And they're not even close! Lol"]
This man should be arrested this is a disgrace / []
Damn ive never seen this....this guy is a borrid liar / []
He had no contact with him because he was jailed lol / []
Andrew are you a liar? ... No I'm just a paedo ..I mean no I don't sweat. / []
It's seems pretty obvious that he's lying, and that the photo is genuine. Surely, it'd be not only honourable but also less damaging in the long run to just admit it, apologise and reach a damages settlement with Virginia. By continuing to deny it means the whole thing will drag on and on, it'll all come out bit by bit, and he'll be left looking both foolish and dispicable. / []
What is fantastic is that Andy talks as though he might run into Jeff at the One Stop one random evening / []

Charlie Proctor on Twitter: “I expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion-level bad."     Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described the interview as "excruciating" and a "car crash." / []
When people try to explain things without being asked its a sign of guilt. The harder he's trying to explain it away then more guilty looks one is not amused / []
Right from the beginning he sounds disingenuous and fake. It makes me sick that he thinks he could lie so blatantly and wed fall for it! / []
If he hadn't seen Jeffrey since 2006, nor had any contact thereafter, why would he feel the need to end the friendship in 2010? Surely not seeing someone in 4 years surely is a sign the friendship was over. There was no need to end it. / []
He get £250,000 of our money 💰every year,while we all work hard some on shifts,some caring for the needs of others, such as him for example, we are indeed stupid, I'm sure we can close both eyes at night because of being tired, he can close his because he hasn't a conscience or a soul.  Parasites don't have a conscience or a soul ,full stop ! / []
Who are the ones disliking this video? Very curious to know. / []

I don't believe that Andrew is guilty of committing the acts that he was accused of this all happened when he was much younger the ladies knew what was going to happen when they went there so they're not innocent in any of this and if they were underage their parents are responsible / []
Would love to see the FBI interview his “security people”. They’ll be able to describe where this clown was and when and for how long. I have a feeling they won’t match his description.  Also, all these people allegedly coming and going like it’s a hotel. He has security for a reason. He’s a high profile target. They wouldn’t let him stay somewhere if that is what it was like.Truth is more likely to be it was just him, Epstein, Maxwell and a load of trafficked young girls. / []

Best example of denial ever / []
Should be investigate the prince and should find out is he fullfil lust on jefery Epstein sexual abuse island. / []
The following except from an article on the sweating phenomenon Andrew claims affected him suggests to me that unless Andrew can produce a physician who can vouch for such a diagnosis or (or a physician’s medical report or notes to provide documentation), Andrew’s claim is implausible and probably fabricated. (I have bolded some of the cited text for emphasis.)  “A complete absence of sweating is called anhidrosis. It can occur in particular areas of the body or be global – where more than 80% of the body has no ability to sweat. The causes are usually damage or pathology of the nervous system, or they may be inherited, such as in the case of Sjogrens Syndrome. Some individuals suffer from hypohidrosis which is a reduction in sweating and can be indicative of dehydration.”  “Regarding Prince Andrew’s claim, *an excess or continual exposure to adrenaline is not widely recognised as causing a lack of sweating in humans.* However, there is some data in horses that has suggested that exposure to extreme temperatures may result in damage to the type of sweat glands that respond to adrenaline.”  “Similarly, the fact that the central nervous system, and parts of it that are linked to controlling the “fight or flight” response system, can also be involved or damaged in psychological trauma, means it is impossible to rule out this possibility without more information. There are a number of reports of individuals who have developed an idiopathic (unexplained) inability to sweat during military and extreme training.”  https://theconversation.com/anhidrosis-why-some-people-apparently-like-prince-andrew-just-cant-sweat-127280 / []
He’s such a dam liar it’s embarrassing! / []
he's Toast, but can Ricky Gervais play Andy in the screen adaptation? / []
The truth will be told. / []
I’m not buying either sides of this conflict. On the one hand you have Prince A who’s so flustered a child would figure he’s a liar. On the other hand, none of the pics with the young women who are apparently the victims portray them to be in any particular distress. On the contrary they seem happy and having the time of their life. As a teenager would you really not realise that when you’re being limousined or flown on a private jet that there’s something shady about it? That you’re in for some deep shizzz that you’re gonna be used??!! C’mon!!! I am NOT buying it. / ['Sara Rossborough-Muhammad said a brain-washed goose who doesn’t have an opinion or a brain so rather than use sound arguments… tells you to shut up 😂😂', '@III-ur2oo  Protecting children is the number one responsibility for all of us']

waste of time a money to go after Andrew. Only the Queen can give him up and I seriously doubt she will do that to her youngest child no matter how guilty he really is. Beside all of those racist have to stick together you know. / []
I love how he says they met through her boyfriend even though she was married and claims she and Epstein werent a couple / []
You know I was living on the streets of Albuquerque at 15 years of age in the prostitution district on Central and I have seen girls at that age know exactly what they are doing and when they get too fat and nobody wants them anymore it's lawsuit time I know a lot of them and that's exactly what's going on here she knew exactly what she was doing that she repeated the ACT over and over and over she wasn't crying rape then she's crying rape now that they don't want her anymore.

Normal people don't even tell you they are ending the friendship they just stop texting you and you already know but this muppet didn't do this.  He must think the British public are all a bunch of idiots and we would all believe anything he says. Lie after lie.  You can run away but you can't hide but in his case he can hide and be protected by our government. / []
Funny that there's a photo of him with the girl but there's no existing photos taken at a party at Pizza Express when photos are usually taken at party's  !  And it's funny that he can remember exactly one important date but nothing else....!  He's totally in denial...he's convinced himself it never  happened ! / []
How the hell the interviewer didn't laugh when he was coming up with these excuses. when he said as soon as someone REMINDED me of what i did that day I was like oh yeah I remember that 🤣🤣🤣 burst out laughing what a tool / []
ooooooooooooooooooooo prince andrew you are such a ******* / []
yes but, but, but, i am guilty! / []
The very definition of  privilege,  completely lacking in self-awareness.  He's so obviously a bare faced liar.....  full of it! / []
There is a solution for Andrew, tell the world that you are a homosexual. / []
Watching this interview was genuinely HILARIOUS.  Gloria Allred's attorney daughter, Lisa Bloom, claims that "we have come a long way" in exposing crimes against women and human beings in general.  But let's have a look at the record, shall we??  First, human slavery is at the highest level in the entire history of mankind, with little children comprising much of it, making the same shoes and clothing we wear every single day.  Many are sold into sexual slavery as well, with wealthy customers like Randy Andy here benefitting directly from their misery.  But this is certainly nothing new, it's been going on for ages.  Those will enormous wealth and power have abused children since the dawn of recording time, and more recently with the vast crimes of the Roman Catholic Church to add to the list, certainly nothing of note.  None of these criminals ever get punished, because their friends are actively participating in the same crimes.  The names in Jeffery Epstein's "Little Black Book" comprises everyone from celebrities, to presidents, to princes, and before he could name names, he was murdered in his high security lockup in New York City, with both cameras broken and both guards sound asleep.  What an amazing coincidence.  As far as The Party Prince goes, however, as long as there are corrupt judges, senators, police, pedophiles, sexual deviates, and other associated individuals, such prostitution rings will continue to grow and flourish.  Even with Harvey Weinstein gone, the casting couch continues, along with other associated crimes to numerous to mention.  This is the way of the world, and it will never, ever change. / []

An expert interview. Masterful, how she managed to restrain revulsion until the very end, only after he'd let his guard down for an hour. / ['Now I have to watch it to the very end.. 😁']
Guilty as fuck.... Going down you dirty shite / []
I’m actually cringing at this interview and the stupid lying looks on his face 😆 he’s made it so obvious he’s lying. How embarrassing 🤦‍♀️ / []
They're hounding Prince Andrew even though he's not broken any UK laws and yet leave the likes of general Pinochet, responsible for thousands of killings alone. This kind of distasteful persecution is what give MSM the bad reputation it deserves. / []
Can you imagine this guy taking a lie detector test 🤣 / ["But he can't sweat, so no use 🤣🤣🤣🤣"]
That is so painful to watch. The worst secondhand embarrassment I have ever experienced. Ouch, Your Royal Highness. / []
‘My tendency to be too honourable.’ 🤣 / []
This is not an interview.  It looks like a trial. / ['And he’s incriminated himself 💯']

‘because he’s been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together’... ‘inappropriate’ ... says it all doesn’t it?  And, if the BBC wasn’t bias- owned and controlled by Windsor- she would have jumped on that! He’s disgusting through and through / []
His Royal Highness 👑 / []
My favorite moment is at 13:42 when she mentions John Brockman and he gets a look of guilty surprise so comical that it looks like something only a sitcom character would do. / ['- Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song plays -', 'Priceless!  😂😂', 'i’m crying', "😅😅 the face got me too. Also I love how the whole reason he wanted to see Epstien was to say he can't be seen with him....choose Central Park for that chat....okay bud", "Is Mr Brockmans statement false? \nI don't know Mr Brockman."]
"so.... there's a medical condition that says I didn't do it so there ya go" 😂😉😂😉😂😉 / []
I would have been rolling with laughter interviewing him / []
'I went to see him and stayed several days, to tell him we shouldn't be seen together, and we went for a walk in the park and that's when I told him.' Well...that makes perfect sense! / ['Its because of his tendency to be to honorable 🤫', '@123Dunebuggy Yes. Too honourable.']
"There was AB-solutely no indication (of sex trafficking)." AND IF THERE WAS..." / []
"I never have...partied. Certainly going to Jeffrey's was not about partying. Absolutely not!" while shaking his head, involuntarily saying, "You're not believing a word of this, are you?" / ['No it was not about  partying  it was about sexually  abusing young girls.']
I was a better liar than he is, when I was ten years old. Why didn't he at least act naive, and say something like, "Well...that was just a kid who worked there, who wanted a selfie with me, so I obliged her!" (blink blink, wide eyes) Some serious narcissism is going on here. / []

"I don't remember going upstairs to take a photo"  but I remember where the photo was taken"  - Prince Andrew / []
@ 19:45 - 46 why does he express surprise and ask "really?"  This reaction is totally inconsistent with his denial a few seconds later that he doesn't know John Brockman. If he didn't know him, why would be look so surprised at the claim that Brockman was there?? / []
This guy is the family jacka$$ / []
He basically buried himself doing this interview. 👌 / []
He wasn’t in trouble enough as a kid / []

The "ROYAL RAPIST" how in the world is this guy not in prison? I guess the Windsor lawyers did a good job.....the queen should be ashamed of herself.. / []
I just came here for the comment section - in another time you would all be beheaded / ['Not a Cromwell', 'Sara Rossborough-Muhammad Maybe we should jut have a Beer and talk football?']
I believe Epstein got a preview of this interview - that is why he committed suicide / []
"Just a straight forward shooting weekend" said no one, ever. This guy is so disconnected from the general public it's scary. / ['When you have that kind of money, it seems you can lie through your teeth and assume everyone believes you', "With his kind of command over the Queens English (literally), PR assistance and the family's long, amicable ties with BBC, one wonders how this train wreck of an interview even took place or was broadcasted", 'So well said!!! 👏👏👏', 'Spot on', 'Maybe in his great grandfather’s time 😂']
How does he know the photograph was taken upstairs if he’s never been upstairs?  How would he recognize it as “upstairs in Gilane’s house” if he’s never been there?  If I saw a photo of myself in a place I’d never been in, I would say “I don’t know where this photo was taken.  I see my friend, I see myself but I have no idea where we are standing.”  And why doesn’t he say, “yes she’s lying,” if he’s innocent of what she’s accusing him of?  Most of us have been accused of something we didn’t do and we don’t hesitate to declare simply, “I didn’t do that.”  It’s also telling how he repeatedly says “I don’t remember, I don’t recall….”  Rather than “no that did not happen”.  It’s disturbing to think that a sober person could have had sex with someone and not  recall it.  And it’s absolutely unbelievable that he wouldn’t have noticed girls around Epstein; there are multiple witnesses - men and women - who have reported girls coming and going, and sexualized paintings of girls in Epstein’s home. / []
Among many hilarious moments, one of my preferred is his reaction when he learns Mr Brockman’s presence (“really???”), followed by “I don’t know Mr Brockman”. / ['…..until the media finds a picture of Prince Andrew with his arm around Mr. Brockman….', 'Agreed.  That’s my favorite. 👍💕', 'No Andy  Mr.  Brockman knows  you.']
Media , especially Daily mail would rather focus there headlines and efforts on Megan for some reason - that reason being cos they're hateful racist pieces of shit. Them not condemning Andrew = supportive of pedophiles / []
The thing about  prince Andrew.....that Virginia woman that is accusing prince Andrew is her real last name miller? Someone scribbled out a Virginia (but that girl looks like the picture in my yearbook in middle school.  But I didn't know her. I bet she is possibly lying. I know that the state of Virginia was a commonwealth. Lol.  Is the photo cgi'ed because look at his hand it looks burnt but yet his face doesn't! / []

My question is this: If you're a British citizen and having watched this, I'm curious as to your feelings and thoughts about the RF now and the Queen?? / ["Nothing to do with the queen is it, we don't blame the parents for the sins of the sons, or the sons for the sins of the parents... that goes with anyone not just the royals", 'never liked them in the first place. the rabbit hole is much deeper than this']
Deny deny deny... guily! I dont remember that photo or that night I'm almost certain I wasn't there / []
I have always wondered if the Prince and Mr. Epstein had been intimate partners at some point.  That could at least partially explain the complete distortions of judgment at various points. / []
Reading the comments on here is even more funny than watching him chat total shite  😂🤣😂🤣 / ["Sara Rossborough-Muhammad  PA is trying to say he's innocent of any involvement.. Clearly not by this interview! I hope all involved get what's coming to them. It's vile and disgusting. The interview and comments are funny not what it's about so chill out 🙄", "Sara Rossborough-Muhammad let's hope all victims of anything like this finally get justice and the sick people doing it get their punishment."]
That look/head shake is the exact same look/head shake I get off my kids when I ask them if they have done something they shouldn't have - knowing full well that they have 🤔 / []
“Since your conviction, we cant be seen together in the public eye” ok if youre cutting off the meaningless relationship, shouldn’t you just not see each other at all? Notice how he just doesn’t want it public. / []
“Your arms were around her waist” “Yes” “You seen the photo” “Yes” “How do you explain this?” *i cant*  Dead giveaway 😂 / ['“We can’t find no evidence that that’s my arm. That’s a photo of me though.”']
“I dont regret befriending mr epstein because of the connections i made and the opportunities that had been given to me by his people and himself”…. / ['I always find that line the most outlandishly funny. It strikes me as “Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way!”', 'So wrong that he even said that']
24:15 I’ve never seen Jeffrey with a camera.... that’s probably because he has all the rooms in his homes professionally wired and fitted with miniature high definition cameras and microphones. / ['Probably? He actually DID and he ALWAYS had girls at his house. Always']
13:42 pay attention to how he reacts to John being named dropped. Then seconds later he says he doesn't know him? / ['Hard to say if he meant “I don’t know who that is,” I interpreted it more as “I know of him but I don’t know him personally.” That being said, the shock was definitely because he realized she had obtained information he didn’t expect existed which might conflict with the versions of the stories he had prepped', '@ryanprussin I thought the same thing. I imagine that John was really there and knows what went down, and Andrew knows that. I really do think that everyone involved has been blackmailed into staying quiet so he was shocked that someone was talking.', 'Best part of the whole interview. I watch it atleast 50X when I need a good laugh. He’s so unaware of himself. So arrogant and condescending. Narcissistic too!']

Who pays for Andrew’s expenses, and home?  Is this not covered by the UK tax dollars.   Wait,  remember how everyone screamed so loudly that Harry was stealing the UK tax dollars for :  security and Rent on a so called “gift” from the Queen... some gift that turned out to be... pay rent on your gift.        What job has Andrew been doing for the past few years, for him to pay “rent” on his “gift” and his Security?  The UK tax dollars cover Andrew rent like they did Harry’s place.  The security would be covered personally by the Queen, like Charles did for Harry. 🧐           So Why is the UK taxpayer covering those expenses and no media fuss is happening????   Andrew is not a working Royal, so why is the UK putting up with the double standard.   Are they just waiting for the queen to die and then boot out Andrew?🤔 / []
He looks so nervous. Probably been over rehearsed and trying hard to look proper vs being himself. He's acting shifty - is it because he's guilty of something illegal or just something embarrassing? You can't tell. I don't think people should just assume the worst. / []
big man doing big man things / []
“I don’t sweat” 😭😭😭 dude just stfu 😬😭 / []
Result of inbreeding 🤣 He was trying to branch out / []
This interviewer is a genius!  The way she lists her questions: "Did you have sex with this woman?" "No I've never seen her before!" "There's a picture of you with her." "Well I don't remember meeting her then." "Apparently the picture is fake." "Uhh.. well.. it might be. Yes, actually it probably is.." / []

Prince 'non sweating' Andrews / []
He he he he, no, no, no, if, if if… he’s a little nervous 😬 😰😰😰 / []
He's "not in a position" to "give sensible answers". / []
He’s not a very good friend. Nor is he a very very close friend. And yet Andrew flew across the Atlantic, spent 4 days at Epstein ‘s home just to end his relationship? Epstein must have been very important to him to make such extraordinary effort to say goodbye. / []
I literally had to watch this through my fingers - it was excruciating to watch - a true car crash ! / []
Oh man....this guy. I wish this gal would ask him to take a lie detector test. He would fail miserably. / []
Perfect disgrace / []
Take a shot every time he says “no recollection” / ['Shit faced 🥴🥴🥴😂😂']
The picture is fake, a small image deception analysis company has just proved it, watch this space folks! / []
This man is not good at all what a monster / []
Where is his mother in all of this.  No comment from her.  She is just the same as all of the so called royal freeloaders.  Just keep quiet and it will go away.  They should be throughly ashamed of themselves, but of course they wont be, because they are filthy rich and untouchable.  No respect for any of them. / []
What's wrong with this dude? / []
UNFORTUNATELY……I DO NOT THINK JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED!!! THE POWER & THE MONEY….THE MONEY & THE POWER!!!! Just like all the global ELITES…. THEY RUN THE SHOW!! The Royals are corrupt inbreds! Look how Diana ended up, she took many secrets to the grave!!!  Jimmy Savile must be proof enough with his friendship with the royals!!! / []
THE BEST EVER VERBAL GRAVE DIGGING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED!!!! / []
A horrible spoilt arrogant little runt!! So entitled and untouchable. He is as guilty as they come. Waffles so much shit he thinks everyone is as stupid as he is. The damage he has done to the royal family is brilliant 👏, bunch of useless out of touch cretins. Shame it has come at the expense of this young woman. / []
Pork Yorky will never willingly go to New Yorky.  Would he CONSENT to go. / []
Prince Andrew was a commander over the air attacks that day on September 11th 2001. Prince Andrew’s, Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators designed the attacks within the City of London / ['No comments no likes.  The queen of england used my american loca,l state and federal government against me for decades.   That women ordered the surgical drain tube wrapped around the colon of my husband. Elizabeth tortured him to deatn, a godly man at age 54.', "Plz elaborate I'm genuinely curious"]
she was a grate journalist ,, Andrew came out as a pathological lair,, / []
Her interviewing skills are outstanding.  She really did not let him get away with anything and she humiliated him to the core.  In terms of protecting himself, being prepared for the occasion lying, and not giving much away, he actually started off quite well. He followed his script and appeared calm enough.  She caught him out very well though and absolutely tore him apart. It was great to see.   Love the lady / []
So laughable. He's a joke / []
Tendency to be more honourable? Bullshit sir!  I hope they nail this guy to the wall. / []
Who remembers when the Royal Family thought the "black sheep" were Princess Diana & Sarah Ferguson??? / []
WHAT THE F, was that at 44:41 when she said she had to bring interview to a close.. a dodgy nervous, relieved laughter that this ordeal was nearly over / []
Eyes looking up and to the side when answering some questions - meant to be classic body language of someone trying to concoct a decent lie on the spot / []
if he was really innocent he would spend most of the time talking about how that photo is fake and he would be outraged.  this interview is nothing more but a confession / []
Interviewer: “That wasn’t you getting a foot massage from a young Russian woman?” Andrew: “No, that couldn’t have happened, I don’t have feet.” / ['Nooooo the massage was from a young French woman!', 'This comment deserves more likes.', 'Loool', 'He is the biggest clown I have ever seen in my life', 'Brilliant!  Really made me giggle!']
This family belongs behind bars!  From Old... to young!! / []
Say the word  Woking and I'll say, "OhyesIrememberthat!" Pure Ricky Gervais a la David Brent. / []
I don't know where the bar is in Tramps lol. / []
Surely they would have CCTV at Tramps nightclub to confirm his association with Virginia Roberts. Unless of course MI5 have gotten hold of the tapes, and destroyed the evidence. / []
4 times a year 😂😂 / []
The likes and dislikes are perfectly balanced... / []
This is a perfect example of the Dunning–Kruger effect theory: people with low ability at a task overestimate their own ability, and people with high ability at a task underestimate (or are more humble / realistic about) their own ability. I.e. Andrew is so disconnected from reality he thinks he is skillful enough to lie his way through an hour long BBC interview and deceive everyone - actually his lies are so ridiculous they are comedic. As they say, a fool says they know everything but a wise man says they know nothing. Kudos to Emily for her composure and calm non-judgmental approach (didn't laugh in his face) which made him feel comfortable to come out with this absolute tripe. / ["I'm surprised that his trousers didn't catch on fire.", 'Well said']
28:06 Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him / []
Only part he was happy in this, was hearing now epstein is dead. hallelujah!!!! / []
Can this man be this stupid? / []
His eyes could tell so much. / []
One has to applaud the interviewer’s composure throughout this interview. If I had been the interviewer there were many times I would have been doubled over in laugher at his responses. He’s certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed. / ['Greetings from the Royal family', "32:13 The brain-racking must've been fairly swiftly done with.."]
Go watch The Behaviour Panel video about This interview. Those guys are awesome. / []
He's a really bad liar! / []
every time he seems to have reached the climax of the disaster.... it goes even worse / ["I really wouldn't use the word 'climax' here..."]
Poor Andy is innocent! / []
There is a medical condition that says "I didn't do it"....surely not the pride of his clan / []
We weren't close friends, yet I stayed in all his residences, visited his private island, flew on his private jet, was the guest of honor at a dinner (NOT a party!) in his home. Then I insisted on "honorably breaking up the friendship" in person because we weren't really that close.  This is his sweaty version of "The Prince's New Clothes".  Andrew must think we are as stupid as he is. / ['Perfectly Put \r\nBrenda Bravo', 'Brenda with the truth!', '@Lakridza67 sad thing its not just Him look how BORIS is behaving and how they are mandating Laws without using the proper conduct to do so', "Like he couldn't afford a hotel", 'Because he is a Royal people like Epstein would invite him to stay, to dinner, to his island etc, without Andrew considering them to be friends. Royals are probably invited to things like that all the time.']
These people think they can lie out of everything, Untouchables! Well I hope he gets what should be coming to him / ['Absolutely']
Please leave this poor innocent man alone! / ['"I don\'t sweat". -Prince Andrew..what a poor innocent reptile..']
"Epstein is dead"  "Hah yes"  Dude are you seriously laughing right now / ['What', "He's just pleased that he's dead and can't spill the beans per se"]
"It's on the second floor, I am sure. "I have never been to the second floor." Um my dude, how would you so surely know it is the second floor / []
He looks a little bit like Darth Vader after Luke pulled his helmet off. / []
Did you meet her? “I cannot say whether the picture is real” 😆 / []
Epstein’s Paris-based personal assistant declared in 2019 that Prince Andrew made regular visits to Epstein’s apartment in Paris. No word about that? / []
Lie detector test while this interview happened couldve been a good interview😅 / []
I really hope he doesn't get away with this.. this is why monarchy is toxic.. Liz is protecting him.. / []
Two amazements I this. 1, he's absolutely lying and is obviously a criminal because of it. 2, Not no one is or can do anything about it. / []
Convenient to stay with a pedophile?  Really? A prince had no money to stay in a hotel??  Andrew stayed at epstein's all four residences. Newyork, his Iseland and other palm spring places etc A prince needed a sex- criminal To introduce him to people???  He is a Prince- a world famous man!! / []

Even a royal willie can get a man into as much trouble as a commoner. All his  excessive hand gestures, fake puzzled frowns, double chin squeezing, head shaking, fact denials, glancing  down to the left, forehead lifting scream  LIAR.  Dragged out fawning and whining. / []

What a disgusting man.... Certainly one of the most embarrassing interview I ever watched.... / []
Did anyone interview the daughters on the pizza run!? / []
There is more corruption with royals than any other aspects of life. The difference is that they get away with it. / []
So they wasn't friends because he was friends with his wife but he felt the need to break their friendship up in person instead of a phonecall and they wasn't close 😂🤔 / ['He had to tell Epstein it was “inappropriate to be seen together” 👀']
Pizza 🍕 Express anyone ? / []
As if he cant afford the literally very best hotel! Lmao jeffreys home was a convenient place to stay even tho it has ruined my reputation!!! So convenient / []
It's time Britain became a Republic. / ['Never']
Bet you Epstein has loads of photos of him stored away I can see another film like the bank job coming out again 😂😂 / []
His face 🤣😹🤣😹 / []
I’m rewatching this - it’s still an unbelievable thing to me that anyone let him do this. I’m glad they did - perhaps they *wanted* him to throw himself under the bus. It’s such obvious lying, he’s so obviously hiding something. The sweating thing…🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Come the revolution / []
I guess only God knows. Judgement will still come to everyone. / []
Most of his body language is concealed so he might have had some mind control done to erase some of the memories. Remember that all royals are under the control of the Freemasons, politicians and might deal with the Bilderbergers and Skull and Bones as well. / []
"Suicide" / []
Randy Andy's Losers Club. We never sweat. / []
During the first few minutes of watching this interview, it's obvious this dude full of excuses and lies. / []
I really like whatever is the real thihg. how polite brits are / []
Presumably he was given the questions in advance, so that he could prepare answers.  In which case, all his responses (complete with exaggerated facial expressions), are acted...  A script.  Badly acted.  That explains a great deal. / []
Why and how did I wind up watching this? This dude is literally tripping over his own lies, and the interviewer…kudos, she was soft-spoken, but firm and direct,  she made him squirm and gave him enough latitude to make him feel confident and play himself. Brilliant. / []
Interview with royals is something interesting, when it comes to digging up their own grave, his royal highness did a wonderful job. When u r aware of facts, when there is truth then why stuttering ?? He stepped back from royal duties,  then why is still having all his titles? / []
After thoroughly reviewing this video I can say with absolutely confidence and certainty that he starts lying from 00:17 and stops at just about 49:25 / ["I'm crying!!! 😹😹😹😹😹😹\nHe's worse than politicians!!!", 'Lol. But how disgraceful.', '😂🤣🤣🤣']
Andrew not helping the investigation that the US kept asking him to help out, he got something to hide. SOOOOOOO many times the US had asked for an interview from him and he declined, what is ANDREW hiding ! / []
Jimmy Savile- died ten years ago in October would have faced and charged his crimes if he were alive. / []
I think Prince Andrew comes across well - he's clearly an honest man... / ["Not to be abrupt, but you're not the sharpest knife in the draw are you.", '@stanstan7426 AWESOME']

He will be locked up by Xmas.feel so sorry 😢 for our beautiful queen of our country England.years ago I met this man when I was a free lance waitress .and believe everything that he is accused of and hopefully 🙏 the truth will come back to haunt him. / ['Beautiful queen?😳🤔']
You could see the avalanche coming from the very first question. This interview, if you do not belong to the firm, is more amusing than the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy movies. / []

This interview was a tremendous opportunity for Prince Andrew to talk about his charitable enterprises. Well done! / []

why has this excuse for a human being not been arrested and thrown into one of his mothers cages, this is not an interview, its a confession. Emily sat there disgusted by his extremely poor attempted cover up... there is so much more to this than meets the eye or ear!! / []
When your passed indiscretions come back to haunt you, in the court of public opinion the royal family is guilty. It’s taken so long for this issue to be resolved so you know that there is undue influence. I like the queen but her children are entitled leeches. / []
good lord... 11:43 / []
I love Emily's WTF face when Prince Andy said Epstein's behaviour had been unbecoming. UNBECOMING??!! He was a sex offender!! / []
This interview reminds me of  the painfully awful speeches in Bridget Jones Diary and President Clinton's speech 'I did not have sexual relations with Monica' LOL people dont lie about having sex with someone they lie about not having sex with someone!!! / []

If someone has an hours worth of questions for you about your friendship with a known child abuser, it’s in no way possible for you to say “idk.” 🤣 / []
Now I understand why lawyers are always advising their clients to plead the Fifth. Andrew should have never done this interview,  he should have never open his mouth to respond to the accusations.   I would not have believed the accusations had I not seen this interview.   But it’s so apparent that he’s lying;  he’s the most incompetent liar I’ve ever heard. / []
Master class in the art of interviewing. / ['Superb.', 'Suicide by interview 101😂', 'Just let the person dig his own grave don’t need to dominate or keep pulling him up let him think he’s doing great and coming across well 😂😂']

If it never happened, no need to waste time to talk about Anything just countersue!! 😂 / []
I can tell you now, he will never be charged.  Richard iii & Henry viii never got charged / []
Prince Andrew's lawyers must have been over the moon when he done this interview, because they know that they would be getting paid for a long time. £££££ / []
Wonder why Andrew doesn't sue Virginia Roberts for defamation of character.... / ['Because he would be cross examined I expect?']
Err and um about 500 times.... These two words are consistent with a compulsive liar... / []
What a vile man, lock him in the Tower of London and throw away the key! / []
13:40 oh when the sh!t hits the fan / []
He is gross / []
Why didn’t she ask if a DBS was done on Epstein? And the background checks? / []
He may be prince but unfortunately he looks and Sounds dumber and dumber..lm not surprised he is in Mass / []
I’ve never been upstairs. That photograph was taken upstairs. Uhhhhh. He’s obviously a member of Mensa. / []
Royals, more like royal pieces of shit / []
These people think they’re elite .... they’re weak , they can’t even own up to their own shit / []
Wow. You would think he would be a little bit better at lying. / []

If you're not really friends with someone then you don't need to go have a face to face talk to end that meaningless friendship... Unless you're guilty of something. / []
It's so easy to read between the lines. He did some things he wasn't supposed to do and got scared when Epstein got caught and had to go have a talk with him. What got me was him saying he doesn't regret his friendship with Epstein because he made good connections with some influential people. He still doesn't have any sympathy for the young women who were being abused. He only thinks about himself and what he got out of it / []
I hate the way this sicko is put on a pedestal / []
Confused. He keeps on saying that was the last time I saw him, I broke off the friendship, oh yeah I went to his party. / ['And stayed multiple nights at his house while breaking off the friendship 🙄']
Imagine getting your mum who is 95 to pay for your legal bills. What a useless Scrounger. / []
Wow!!! I'm so glad this lady didn't give him a fluff interview simply because he's a member of the Royal Family. / []

Why are my comments being deleted off here / []

Ultimately, the British people need to take a serious look at the way their country is governed and decide if they really want a gilded family at the top of it. These people have been on a pedestal all their lives and yet they’re just ordinary human beings like the rest of us. This Prince is totally deluded of his own self-importance because of the life he’s lived. / ['@True-Spirit100 you’re as deluded as Andrew if you think that 90% of the U.K. approve of the monarchy.', "Yes we do. Our Monarchy has survived the test of time and they have done well for the United Kingdom. They are human beings also but have proved worthy of their roles supporting the King or Queen in his or her role as the Constitutional Monarchy. If one member is not worthy of his or her role then they are resigned from it. They are individuals who can carry on with their own affairs. So does Prince Andrew. No one can dictate.\n\nThe protocols are laid down in the constitution and the working Royals abide by it. There are also the Palace Protocols to follow in order to run the Establishment smoothly as expected. 90% of us are happy with it. We won't change it for the world for the fancy of you or any other.\n\nWe have seen the disarray in many republican countries, new and old. Corruption and backstabbing and murder. Democracy is actually not working in many Countries. Go and clean your own countries rather than interfering with our Constitutional Monarchy.", "To @מט ג'ורג -  If you want replies to your comments you should make a fair English translation to your name as it is playing havoc and rides to the right when clicked on it, proving it to be middle eastern writing.

I have re-posted it from my  archive. I don't know what you are playing at.", "To @מט ג'ורג  Yes, I do and it has nothing to do with Prince Andrew. He is his own man and has resigned to his own destiny.  Monarchy is part of the British Constitution. It will remain so for a very long time. Let the rest of the world concentrate on their own problems while we concentrate on ours. The Monarchy evolved into the British constitution for 800 years and it is still evolving.. So much cannot be said for the rest of the world. Kings or Presidents. They are corrupt and collapsing in front of our Eyes. So wherever you are from or whatever community you belong, turn your attention there."]
I would never use his dentist lolz / []
Truthfully......this family is RUBBISH!!!! / []
I really really really wish, before she dies, the Queen gives Andrew the beating, the thrashing she has been owning, to him, to herself and to her British subjects, since he was a little entitled brat...

Good thing the english tax payers finance this circus.lol / []
Never seen this guy must of been hiding / []
In his interview with Newsnight, Prince Andrew never denied outright his sexual misdemeanours - he merely said that he had no memories of them. He didn't say that he would swear under oath - only that he would have to take legal advice on whether to do so. These evations make me smell a rat. / []
This is just too easy, he says he doesn't sweat, he never goes to certain places, he never drinks, he never does this or that, he never remembers anything either, and clearly he doesn't know how to lie, nor how to be honest, privilege in full display. Glad to know he will be facing the law too, probably with the help of his dear friend who is now in jail. / []
There is one person who can clear up this ghastly 'misunderstanding' and exonerate His Royal Fogginess - Ghislaine Maxwell.  Or not. / []

Hey I would have covered the cost at a hotel for you Prince Andrew and I am not even a UK coffer / []

If you hang around with a sinking ship it will take you down with it.  Sunk!  Proven with his own confession. / []
You don't need to be a body language expert to know he is lying throughout the interview. He's a creepy little man. / []
He lies like Alan Partridge. / ['Brilliant 🤣']
If your so called friends wife and who ever was involved and u didn’t know a thing your reaction would be so different you would be genuinely mortified  This man is a vile predator and should be trailed and sentenced / []
Lier pants on fire 🔥 / []
It wasn’t a party, it was a shooting weekend. Or a dinner. Just a dinner with shooting really. / []
First he says he had to visit Epstein personally to break up his friendship with him (you would only do that with a very close friend), then later he denies the friendship altogether. Liar and guilty / []
He is soo rich - he could of stayed somewhere else! 🤔🤔🤔 / []
The photo was taken upstairs but he had never been upstairs in that house before so how does he know the photo was taken upstairs? / []
Self report omegalul / []
This is so cringeworthy to watch 🤦🏻‍♀️😬 Like watching a kid trying to worm his way out of something. Ended the friendship and then saying it was the honourable and right thing to do to stay with a convicted sex offender out of convenience?! Wow mind blowing and completely confusing / []
What a plank / []
He is innocent. These are the Royals, they don't go to bars and don't go anywhere without security....Oh ya, guess who I saw in the bar last night, why the prince himself dancing with someone who somehow got in underage even, it would have come out then. Here is a link for you: How to photoshop two people together in the same photo, step by step guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_pGVEtd07A . This interviewer is not thinking but thoroughly entertaining. The accusation is ridiculous and he amount of group think surrounding this is astonishing. Epstein had a fetish and no one else is responsible for what he did. He networked with a lot of people as a financier and many people didn't know what he was. That Virginia person could go to jail for what she is trying. She could've slept with anybody. / []
“ that photo was taken upstairs” “ I’ve never been upstairs”  Me: how do you know it’s upstairs ? / ['He knows its upstairs cos the photo shows stairs look at full photo', 'As crooked as his tie', 'Because the dining table is down stairs 😂😂😂😂😂', "Also I believe he earlier agreed he'd spent a night at house.... probably shackled in basement getting cornholed by Epstein and Maxwell, aye", 'Exactly']
HE is lying, I saw a little sweat dropping on the side of his head! / []
"When the allegations came out originally, I went, well that's a bit strange I don't remember this". If you were innocent your reaction should be more like WTF!!! / []
Epstein's behavior with underaged girls was "unbecoming." / []
Remembers what he wants to remember. How convenient... / []
Prince Andrew appears to have no self-awareness or social awareness.  “I don’t remember” is not the same as “I did not”.  This interview is the gift that keeps giving.  Emily is brilliant.  @31:00 (laughing dupers delight) / ['Emily has no real follow up questions as none were allowed in the  scripted interview. She is just a news reader not an investigative journalist', '@Михаиллеви Hence why she did brilliantly despite her constraints', "@violinstar5948 any of those gormless news readers can read a script. That is their primary function. She was chosen to give it female gravitas so the fools would be fooled. Scripted down to the last full stop.  BBC know he was blackmailed into that 'interview' as when he said we have been trying to arrange this interview for 6 months that was coded language for 'fjnalise the script'", "@Михаиллеви I too, am a huge fan of drugs, what's your favourite?", '@hishamhanif3740 sheet....bullsheet...and you smell of it']
TRAIN WRECK 🚞 / []
This is the definition of giving someone enough rope.  SO GUILTY. / []
Can you imagine what he would be like if he was in a court and on trial 😂😅. / ['We will never know.']
He's not a a world champion liar lol / []
The opportunities you were presented through him, you are a member of the royal family, / []
Moron full stop, has a stupid answer for everything. / []
Your'e simply the LIAR .... / []
"I don't sweat" **Says it while his Ass is dripping down** / ['Didn’t sweat for the thirty odd years since the Falkland Islands conflict until he met Epstein and this girl but now in the short period of time since then amazingly it’s fixed itself so no worries there and no doctor can verify it. The guy is a very bad liar.']
Isn’t it time Clinton was exposed too? / []
Randy Andy probably arranged the 'suicide' / []
Oh man..what a baaad liar…amateurish really. / []
This royal should of got an average Joe to teach him how to lie properly / []
Just imagine if this had been done by the son of a President or Prime Minister of a former colony. BBC would have declared the Govt a vicious regime. / []
Talk about digging is own grave every word spoken was complete bullshit / []
"U.S. law suit...yeah, bring it on, No sweat"! / []
I thought he was smarter and better advised for this interview... Given his privileged upbringing, education and  team of advisers.... He doesn’t even know how to answer... he’s cornered in every question... If not guilty... Why not being relaxed and at ease ... / []
Funny, but I think most, if not all, British royals have very low IQs. This guy is a total bullshit. I respect the Queen & the late Prince Phillip, but all the other royals are ridiculous. / ["when you have everything handed to you and have financial security you don't have to develop an IQ and the skills needed to survive.  those muscles don't get exercised and fade away because they don't need them.  if you have to actually earn a living and make your own way in the world, you retain and develop the makings of an IQ.", "@toconnor7152 yes, you're right."]
He doesn't  remember  going upstairs  was he blind folded  what a stupid  dork not the sharpest tool in the box. / []
Emily was an amazing  interviewer  they couldn't  of had anyone  better she was superb. / ["couldn't have*", 'The odds for her ever being let into Buckingham again are pretty vague..']
No smoke without  fire boyo caught with  your pants down  so many witnesses  and still he denies  these allegations such a bare faced liar. / []
How arrogant  he as a member of the royal family  as if we dont know  that he always  has to include  this pompous  arrogant  attitude  you can see why the public  dont like him. / []
He is so pompous  instead  of saying his ex wife he says the Duchess he is so arrogant  and unlikable  his own staff and navy colleagues  hated this horrible  insignificant  entitled  person hope he gets his comeuppance  he is not above the law as he seems to think so his past has come back to bite him on the arse well done Virginia take him to the cleaners. / []
The wrong people run the country because they can get away with anything, they couldn't care less, rape steal, make a mockery of the Monarchy and empower themselves, otherwise they would have been kicked into touch long ago.  What are they waiting for; demonstrations on the streets. / []
Andrew, you were upstairs because you were sleeping with a teenager. That’s why you were upstairs. / []
Do you regret being friends with a child predator?   Andrew: Uhhhh no. / []
Lol isn’t this dude media trained? Don’t these people have a team full of people to prep him for these questions? Every response he gave was so bad for him. / []
I bet if he wasn’t circumcised then he definitely is now 😂😂😂😂 / []
This blokes full off shit / []
Why would I buy a kids book from Sarah if she lives with and stands by him????? Prince andrew 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
Prince andrew 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 / []
