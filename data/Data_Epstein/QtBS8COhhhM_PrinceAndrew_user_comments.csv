32:00 This point is particularly hurtful. He is basically saying sex is a positive act for him.  It's hard to forget a positive act. But he can't remember it. Then says it didn't happen. And if it had been positive he would have remembered it. Classic narcissistic move. In one swift move he is saying she means absolutely nothing to him and he doesn't remember her. It's designed to be hurtful and make her feel like nothing. Yet he refuses to say she is lying. It's a disaster of an interview. He could not look more guilty if he tried. I agree with Virginia 'He knows exactly what he has done and he needs to come clean'.  However it's almost impossible to get a narcissist to admit accountability sadly.,['🎉correct❤'],2025-11-10T13:12:05Z,@franparkinson2040

"Brought that trash to the queens house. 300 yrs ago he'd lost his head. He doesn't remember the photo taken but remembers the upstairs of Epstein's dump? This is a man that lived in 5 k room castles at times. But remembers the little shack's upstairs? Why? Because it's where all the nasty went on. She's in the picture because she could pass for 18-19. Much younger were as he says upstairs. 8,9, 10 yrs olds. And everyone thought Charles or Diana was the worst F ups. I'm surprised he didn't mention Diana hanging out with Michael Jackson. I know many loved DI but she was just as crazy/careless and hung out with some real creeps. I'm thinking the queen left this life her only hope William . not burning the Kingdom down. Long Live  William the son the queen never had. I think queen Camilla handled her situation well . And Kate will make a great queen.

"His best move would have been to lambast Epstein and Maxwell, across the board. The second thing would have been to lean on the idea that both Epstein and Maxwell were calculated in blackmail, so they took any opportunity to get material on powerful people. He then would say, ""Yes, I met that woman once and we did take a picture together. We all went out to dinner, went to the night club, there were a lot of people with us, including her. I didn't think much of it... I didn't think she was underaged because she got into the club. I just assumed everyone with us was of age. I didn't think anything of it. At one point, she asked for a picture and we took it. I left shortly after. In hindsight, I do think Jeffery took that picture for blackmail purposes. Same with the pictures in the park. As far as her allegations against me, those things never happened. I don't know if it's Epstein and Maxwell brainwashing her or convinced her it happened, but it didn't. I understand that she suffered long-term trauma with what she went through, so I'm convinced that Epstein and Maxwell, as part of their blackmailing, convinced her, probably over years, that we had relations when we didn't."" I think I would even add in that Epstein at some point threatened me with that picture and said Virginia will make statements...","[""That would have been a masterful explanation. However, Virginia said there were two other times she was trafficked to Andrew and there are witnesses that said they saw Andrew and Virginia together in New York and the Virgin Islands. So he couldn't have explained they met just once."", ""@conversegirl1011 I wonder if he could have said others did see them, maybe multiple times, just as they were with a crowd at Tramp night club, but he wasn't with her, but rather she was with him, Epstein, Maxwell, and all kinds of other people. Just muddy the water like, yeah, I saw her a few times, she was just in the mix of people... I wasn't there to see her or vice versa... either way, he was doomed. No one is believing any excuse. We all know what he did, but if you're going to lie, come up with a good one, even if no one believes it.""]",2025-11-08T16:03:43Z,@seanlandonclarke

"Re watching this 5 years later, knowing what we know know, this interview is honestly just insane. The sheer arrogance he had where he genuinely thought he could lie his way out of the mess he had made tells the public many things. But the biggest one is just how clever he thought he was and how dumb he thought the public was. Which is precisely why he is now plain old Andrew. A old man with no friends left in his corner. His final years will be sad and lonely which is exactly what he deserves. His entire life he believed he was better than the rest, when in actual fact, he was much much worse... I cant rule out criminal charges heading his way, this story isn't over yet.","['There’s not a single shred of evdience against him presented to the public or, presumably, the police.

"This interview does *NOT* incriminate Andrew.  What people interpret as sinister is what a person who is very frightened might be expected to say.
The ""cannot sweat"" is nonsense, proves nothing except that Andrew's thinking is jammed from extreme emotion.  His 'alibi' of buying fast food also shows he cannot think.  Not because he is stupid but because he is terrified.
The photo of Andrew with his arm around Virginia's waist points suspicion at Epstein who probably took the photo, and at Ghislaine (visible in the same photo) for springing a blackmailing/defamation honey trap that took Andrew by surprise.  Andrew was not at Epstein's home but Ghislaine's in London.

What is acknowledged is that Andrew is promiscuous.  But while he manifestly enjoys sexual company of young women he is not necessarily going after girls below the legal age of consent.","[""Even though I don't believe anything he says you would be a good lawyer for him and the first thing he should've shut his flapping big mouth"", 'Why would anyone defend royal pedos is beyond me']",2025-11-02T04:06:04Z,@beakytwitch7905

The US Justice Service has recently reached out to Andrew (a private UK citizen) to offer a virtual meeting to assist with their investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. Anything that Andrew knows about Jeffrey would be a massive help to their inquiries and would help the victims of sexual abuse. If Andrew has nothing to hide then why does he choose to hide from their inquiries. They have offered all sort of IT arrangements i.e. to have a solicitor present in a Teams meeting. You would have thought he would jump at the chance to help the victims because he is a high profile figure. Andrew says he had to show leadership & go in person to see Jeffery so why does he not show the same leadership in helping with the US inquiries. We have a legal system in the UK whereby you have to prove someone guilty you can't just assume someone is guilty. In the case of this UK citizen Andrew is proving himself to be guilty by not attending a Zoom/Teams session. There are things in this interview which have proven to be untrue. This man is 8th in line to the British throne & will be moved to the Sandringham estate to be hidden from public gaze. He has enjoyed fingering the vaginas of underaged girls & will not be punished as a sex pest. Hiding a sex pervert who is 8th in line does not put Britain in a good light. Andrew assumed he was entitled to sex & has a warped understanding of how an honourable person should behave. There is only one outcome. Andrew needs to do time in prison alongside other sex offenders. That would be the honourable thing to do.,[],2025-11-01T14:44:57Z,@macswad

"This whole situation is only a big deal if you hold PA to some sort of higher standard + expect a certain level of morality in his behaviour.

Having sex with a 17-year old girl isn't a crime, + neither is associating with the likes of Epstein, or any other form of scum you might encounter.
I don't see what the big deal is, we're not talking about the Arch Bishop of Canterbury, he's a minor Royal until he's suddenly more significant for the convenience of selling a scandal narrative.
'Older bloke has sex with a young girl + spends time with a criminal.'
Not much of a headline, it covers it, though, unless you see the guy as something other than ordinary, which you have to if you believe he deserves being put on trial. He's superior, a cut above regular folks, I don't mean posh, I'm talking higher virtue.
Before I go, this young lady, she wasn't kept locked up, was she? What kept her on-site?
3 times she was there, in 3 different locations, taking smiley group photos that came in very handy later on, a real stroke of luck.
She was a victim, apparently, although she looked like a fan, to me, but everyone seems to believe her.

He says he doesn't know where the bar in Trance is. He's never been there. Then he said he doesn't drink. And then says  I he doesn't ever remember every buying a drink in Trance whenever he was there.

"Mr ambassador of the highest standards, I’m sorry to say that there are too many loopholes in your statements, when you were Maxwell‘s friend. Why would you not go and stay with her instead of staying with Epstein, and if he was not a close friend of yours and he didn’t have evidence against you. Why did you have to go for four days when you don’t even know the guy so well or what he’s up to? Why did you have to go all the way and stay with him for four days? just to tell him that you can’t be friends with him. Your movement is not simple and expensive. Why would you make that trip? Just to say to somebody who is not even your close friend that you don’t want to be, his friend - doesn’t make sense. The only option you have is to be honest and honour the woman that you have offended from the space that you didn’t know any better. You have this great opportunity of a life to become a better person. Don’t waste it by lying because you’re lying to nobody except yourself and that being a prince, you have to lie to yourself is very infitting very dishonourable and it’s really not holding the highest standards. I’m sorry. Please come out in the open and say what has happened. It’s not a crime. It’s human nature for centuries. Men have behaved like this, so you are not an exception, and you’re not a monster it’s just normal for somebody in your position to do what you’ve done, so there is no need to lie.

Adicional ahora Andrés resulta que tenia un espia Chino... y negocios obscuros.. Salio un perfecto delincuente de corbata.

Ahora el Rey Carlos lo mismo, deberian dejar que se vaya a la cárcel su hermano para asi salvar la poca dignidad  corona, porque asi lo van a sacar y que termine un reinado de una vez. 
Bastante mala reputación tiene Carlos con haberse casado con su amante a pesar de que sus hijos le hayan pedido que no lo haga.

A socialist system of governance, in which the State steals from the smart, capable and innovative, and gives to hoards of low IQ, black and brown scum, thieves, rapists and murderers. From men to women. From straight people, to homosexual demons. In a democracy,  presidents and prime ministers are pre-selected, but the a clown-show called ""elections"" usually creates the pretense of ""competition"".  Democratic leaders are almost always pedophiles and rapists. 

Example 1: 
- Did you vote in the latest election? 
- Yes! I am excited for our new president to rape children 

Example 2: 
- Do you like our system of constitutional monarchy and representative democracy?

"I understand the Epstein files were brutal “ a truly bloody mess from miscarriage of tubal pregnancy dna Epstein baby “ 

yet when are the accusers going to be held accountable for bringing this up every 2 to 3 to 5 years to stop asking “ the story is never going to change  it is constantly the same with every detail  not explained “ 

“ the accusers need to take responsibility for bringing this up to the royal family has constantly every 2 to 3 to 5 years  been harassed about this the royal family has nothing to do with Prince Andrew’s late night dateing “ the news media I  feel is constant harassment to the royal family 

the prince has said what he knew all along Prince knew about Epstein files  that night the lady suffered a miscarriage a tubal pregnancy meaning the pregnancy fertilized in the tube not the uterus 

“ & dna of the deceased embryo showed it was Epstein baby 1 month before the Prince ever got there showing Epstein was a maniac plotting and planning the princes nightmares “  and it takes two to three weeks for a  tubal  pregnancy to show up “  

meaning she was already pregnant “ saying she was a virgin to the Prince & was pregnant with Epstein embryo “ 

Brutal lies “ 

what about constant harassment to the world to bring this up every 2 to 3 to 5 years  

Prince Andrew should make one statement about the beginning of how he met Epstein and the parties that went on and all what the constant people who never let this go “ & have the same information available all the time same file same words same of what happened everytime whomever keeps bringing this up  and hand out flyers everytime the press is there shove them out the door slot with a hop it out of here media now !! & call the guards “ 

the Prince is constantly harassed about this the Prince admits  what really happened “ took responsibility for his actions although I’m still not sure because it is not  ILEGAL to sex a minor in United Kingdom only in United States when is Uk and USA courts connected ????  

IN United States if a male adult sexes a female minor it’s rape even if it’s consensual “ same for a adult woman and minor guy “ 

When. the people go to   Bother the Prince again have flyers  ready same exact one for every 2-3-5 years ago “ 

Through the whole statements of news media everyone was about Epstein and Maxwell   then they say the Prince was there in the background every time they never say what the Prince did just that the Prince was there “ 

Maxwell and Epstein their words 

Of maxwell and Epstein constantly rarely is the news media saying the Prince “

the news media yet they constantly bring in the Prince when it has always been Maxwell and Epstein “ 

Their words Epstein Maxwell Epstein Maxwell Epstein Maxwell then the Prince was in the background  sounds like the Prince is innocent to me and by the laws “ rediculous “ 


I don’t know how many people know that when a adult in United States even consensual sex to a minor is rape yet in United Kingdom’ it is not against the law to sex a minor why is United States handling Uk court cases how did USA even be involved “ in this case it’s Uk not USA court “ strange “ 

When are these harassments going to be held accountable for constantly bringing this up this court case is costing billions and the news media making billions on the story what about news media that keeps bringing this up Maxwell and Epstein the Prince in the background 

making billions and trillions of dollars out of this story and using the information to like their pockets the story needs to end and be done with it and files shoved out the Royal door same words same thing that happened the same statement in a sworn statement and at the end go away “ 

Stop using the story to make billions of dollars off of it “ find other ways to help “ make a huge trafficking shelter for women with trafficking can go to shelters “ instead of using to make news media rich “ 

Concentrate on fixing the trafficking “ use news media money for that “ 

The news media has made billions of dollars for this story Maxwell and Epstein  and Prince in the background “ 

Prince had his arm around her “ also people need to think about this if I hate something or someone truly hates something young they go home and they are supposed to say something if she was really brutally attacked with Epstein and Maxwell and Prince Andrew she would had told on them and reported them and instead lived with them made emends with them and was their friend in the end “ 

& the supposed tormented woman had children with Epstein and Maxwell “ & never go back “ she went back so many times “ when is it that someone in judicial system says she went back stayed 2 years and a child was made by Epstein or Maxwell or Prince not sure whom for 2 years and something happened perhaps the money stopped or negotiations of money and the men walked away then she said rape after two years again “ 

She should had left and never returned if it was so devastating yet the money was good “ the power the fashion so she returns to Epstein and Maxwell and continues trafficking “ & the men in desperate need of a child and a love life played house with this young lady for 2 years “ for money “ 

I’m sure if all this happened the Prince gave her good money to shut her trap right ? So why did she return? Well the money the fashion the power “ & whenever money was being negotiated she left and went somewhere to say rape “ 

yet if a woman or person doesn’t like something she could had fled went to a woman’s shelter and went to  somewhere in the very beginning since she was in such fear and didn’t and they made negotiations of money and she returned to Epstein Maxwell and the prince for 2 years and it’s not illegal to be with a minor in uk “ 🇬🇧 

The news media that shocked me OK HOW CAN SHE BE A PREGNANT VIRGIN “ & SHE MISCARRIED EPSTEINS BABY “ YET APARENTLY THE PRINCE WAS THE FIRST AND SHE WAS A VIRGIN TO THE PRINCE THE media  IS MAKING NO SENSE “ a virgin suffering a miscarriage that day bleeding and suffering a miscarriage from the sec event & a apropos  pregnancy 

What came first epsteins baby or the virgin girl with the prince because the news media makes it look like she was pregnant with epsteins baby and sexed the prince a pregnant virgin “ 

The prince and the royal family will be so smart to make a slot at the royal family door so that when the media goes to ask about Epstein and Maxwell   & the prince watching the royal family slips the folder of the statement of how the prince the nightmare of men  Epstein and Maxwell  “ 

the statement. The prince has always stated and constantly slip the same file through the door and at then go away  media stop making money off my story “
   
Epstein baby “ shareing baby playing house lonely men Epstein and Maxwell picked Andrew’s loneliness not married and used him to set up the royal family and bribe the royal family “that’s why the picked  Prince Andrew “ to set up to constantly try to get money for Royal family scareing them “ 

Epstein and Maxwell trust is setting up the Prince the whole time “ to constantly bribe the royal family when they wouldn’t be bribed by Epstein anymore then Epstein starts bringing out the story “ because the royal family won’t be blackmailed “  keep shoving the same files at news media and say good bye media “ 


Stop making money off the Royal family leave Andrew’s story these medias are making billions of dollars off the story use the money to stop drug trafficking forever with the billions of dollars made 
 She was so tormented explain how so ? and waited for two years to be fed up 
when the money stopped “ for whatever reason “ I think it was Epstein was arested “",['Also my news update the guardsmen seen the young lady go in and out of the castle to the royal family they also made amends with the prince and queen before the queen passed away “'],2025-10-22T02:26:34Z,@dennaspradlin9777

"He answered the core questions very evasively : e.g. instead of saying “I never met this woman” he said “I have no recollection of meeting her”. For example, if further photographs / proof were to turn up, then he can always say “OK, that’s correct, but I have no recollection of it”. That sounds to me like advice from his lawyers, rather than what he would normally say... He used the same tactics when questioned about the photograph of himself and Virginia : “It cannot be proven if the photograph is fake or not..” Once Virginia’s book is released, this case is going to really explode again! I thought that the out of court settlement prescribed that she would then “forever hold her peace” on this subject, but clearly this is not the case..","['The ‘I have no recollection’ is such a terrible defence because it implies that it could have happened, you just can’t remember.']",2025-10-20T22:24:40Z,@zeejimi4044

He was thinking “How dare she continue questioning me in this way”! He literally jerks back trying to control his rage. “As it were”. “If you see what I mean”. “You must understand”. Good lord what a pompous ass. He literally chokes when she talks about giving a statement under oath. He chokes. “From that day forth, I was never in contact either him” is also, we now know, another of a plethora of bold faced lies. You can tell he is utterly exhausted by the end of the interview. He barely made it through alive. “Your Royal Highness” she concludes. He won’t be hearing that anymore!!! 😂",[],2025-10-20T15:21:35Z,@nyccolm

Along the way, though, this man has been propped up and babysat and enabled. Why would he be given a job as a trade ambassador when it’s clear he was clueless? His late mother made a huge mistake in spoiling this son.
She may no longer be here, but that £12 million settlement has created a storm which threatens a system she worked hard to preserve - a Royal Family.
The fact that this man says he cut contact with JE and was then emailing him about ‘playing’ again is absolutely sickening.
This man is so arrogant he has no idea that this interview would serve as a benchmark. 
He will never face justice.

"""What happened next was nothing short of remarkable, a head scratching twist. After the FBI raid, Dougan managed to slip away from police surveillance. He later emerged in Moscow, where, after seeking political asylum, he forged a new career as an IT and cyber-security consultant. After Epstein's July 2019 arrest, Dougan began posting about the existence of the alleged tapes on Facebook. In an interview, Dougan claimed that the hard drive had been taken in the 2016 FBI raid but that he had by this point realized what was on the tapes and made copies, which he said he took with him to Russia,
  In September 2019, a month after Epstein's death, the Times of London reported that Dougan's alleged trove of digital and viden data had sparked the interest of MI6, the British overseas intelligence gathering service. Among Dougan's data was purportedly compro-mising material on Prince Andrew.7
  As Dougan sees it, ""the logical conclusion is the FBI must have seen what was on the videos and they must have seen Prince Andrew and they must have contacted MI6,"" he explained. ""The FBI isn't going to contact MI6 unless they have a reason to share information.
  Shortly after the story broke, Ron Chepesiuk, a prolific writer of true crime stories, visited Dougan in his Moscow home. Chepesiuk had reached out to Dougan a year earlier in the hope of writing a television show based on Dougan's life. For Chepesiuk, the fact that Dougan allegedly possessed these tapes added another level of Chepesiuk intrigue to the strange saga.""9
  During the visit, Dougan floated the idea to Chepesiuk of sam-pling some of the tapes. ""I was surprised that he trusted me that much to show me the tapes,"" Chepesiuk said in an interview for this book. ""I can see from his point of view, he wanted to have somebody verify [it].""",[],2025-09-21T22:07:03Z,@RobB-g1w

"0:18 Andrew explains why he chose to speak up now
1:01 His friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell and his bf Jeffrey Epstein
2:25 His perceived image of being ""The Party Prince""
4:43 The Shooting Weekend at Sandringham with Ghislaine
5:15 Did he know that Epstein was a sex-trafficker?
6:11 Nothing struck you as suspicious??
6:19 Admittance of staying at Epstein Island
6:46 Why did Andrew invite a sex-trafficker who had r*ped a minor to his daughter's 18th birthday party?
7:11 Andrew: Epstein never told me that he was being investigated for sex-trafficking
7:59 No contact with Epstein when he was serving time
8:29 Staying with Epstein within months of him being released
8:49 ""I went there to say him that it was inappropriate for us to be seen together"" 😂
10:58 ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no""
11:23 Liar caught red handed, Emily ""You were the guest of honour for a party Epstein threw to celebrate his release""; Andrew: No I didn't go; Andrew (micro-seconds later): I did go but it was not a release party but a ""small dinner party""
11:53 Andrew: Ok I admit was at the dinner party (scoffs nervously)
12:10 ""It was a convenient place to stay"" (in a sex-offender's house) and ""it was the honourable and right thing to do"" [says the son of the Queen]
13:28 ""What they (young naked girls) were doing and why they were there I had nothing to do with....I really don't know"" 🤡
13:42 See his expressions 🤣😭
13:47 About receiving a foot massage from a Russian girl
14:23 Ending friendship with Epstein  (saying him they shouldn't be seen together now) by house-partying for 4 days.
14:59 His expressions while trying to deny that he got played by Epstein into getting captured in that infamous Central Park photo.
16:28 Was Epstein blackmailing Andrew?
16:43 Do you regret the whole friendship with Epstein?
16:45 ""Now, STILL NOT""
17:36 Careful planning before breaking up with Epstein
18:31 Virginia Roberts
18:46 ""she went on to have sex with you""
18:53 I have no RECOLLECTION of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.
18:59 to 20:01 Andrew denies of not remembering Virginia Roberts (""remembering"" not ""meeting"" or ""knowing"")
19:44 I don't know where are the bars in Tramps. I don't drink. I don't (think) I've ever bought a drink in Tramps
20:00 I was at home with my children
20:19 I was at the Pizza Express with Beatrice
21:07 Someone (probably the Royal Palace PR) reminded him that he was at the Pizza Express and not with Virginia on that fateful night.
21:30 Profusely sweating 21:38 ""I DON'T SWEAT"" (just seconds later) ""I DIDN'T SWEAT that night (with Virginia)
22:21 to 23:00 More denials of not ""remembering"" dining,dancing and having sex with Virginia
22:35 I don't know if I've met her but no, I have no RECOLLECTION of meeting her.
23:09 I can't (explain the photo)
23:29 ""you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not""
23:58 I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken. (Again)
24:28 I don't remember going upstairs in the house because that photograph was taken upstairs (if Andrew never went upstairs then how the hell could you identify that it's upstairs 🤡)
24:58 Because I have no recollection of that photograph ever being taken. (AGAIN)
28:07 watch the expressions
28:15 How did he know the date it's in April??
28:52 ""So I DON'T think that COULD HAVE happened at all."" (Andrew doesn't say that it DIDN'T happen at all)
28:26 gives a long ass explanation of where he was denying that he could be at the Epstein mansion...seconds later 29:01 I probably did (visit Epstein mansion).
30:20 Andrew's answer to whether Virginia is lying or not
31:17 Andrew's message for Virginia Roberts: 
31:52 Andrew: if you're a man it is a POSITIVE ACT to have sex with somebody. (indicating that if he had sex with any underage girl he would've definitely remembered it coz it's a positive act 🤢)
32:13 I've wracked my brain and thinking oh… when the first allegations, when the allegations came out originally I went well that's a bit strange, I don't remember this and then I've been through it and through it and through it over and over and over again and no, nothing. (WHY THE HELL WOULD U NEED TO THINK THIS MUCH, YOU EITHER HAD SEX OR NOT, IT'S NOTHING IN BETWEEN. THE ONLY EXPLANATION IS THAT YOU DID HAVE SEX WITH SOMEONE SIMILAR, UNDERAGE GIRL BUT THAT'S NOT VIRGINIA OR YOU HAD SEX WITH SO MANY UNDERAGE GIRLS THAT YOU CANNOT PIN POINT IF VIRGINIA WAS ONE AMONG THEM OR NOT)
32:45 Four times a year? 🤡 (His implication being I've visited Epstein's Florida residence but not that many times)
34:24 to 36:29 Andrew says he never find anything suspicious, all the time he was with Jeffrey Epstein.
36:33 Will Andrew testify under oath? Andrew: I will have to take all the legal advice.
38:15 Andrew's response on hearing that Epstein has died: SHOCK.
38:22 Watch the expressions as Emily asks Andrew if he thinks Epstein's death was a suicide or murder.
39:00 Andrew: I've no idea (about Ghislaine Maxwell's role in sex-trafficking, remember Andrew has been saying upto this point that Ghislaine was his old friend and he met Epstein through Ghislaine)
39:54 Andrew says his last contact with Ghislaine was in spring , he implies it was before Epstein's arrest, Emily contradicts the timeline and Andrew changes his timeline.
41:17 How Epstein episode affected Andrew's family especially his daughters?
42:41 Has the Epstein episode damaged the Queen's reputation?
47:06 Does Andrew have any ""guilt, regret or shame"" about his friendship with Epstein?
47:22 Andrew: My association with Epstein had some ""seriously beneficial outcomes"" 🤡
47:59 Andrew: Epstein has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner ""UNBECOMING"". 🤡
48:07 Emily shocked at the use of the adjective ""UNBECOMING""
48:11 Andrew: I'm being POLITE (for a sex-offender) 🤡
48:45 Andrew laughs off the fact that he stayed with Epstein at his house even after he had been convicted.
49:11 Andrew is grateful to BBC and Emily for this interview.

"Wow. In reflecting on this interview and scandal, especially as the Epstein Scandal re-emerges in the US, I'm struck by the fact that, following this interview, neither the press nor the public were not convinced by Prince Andrew's interview; rather, his responses had the opposite effect and intensified existing concerns. The interview was widely described as a ""car crash"" and a ""disaster"" because of several key factors:

Lack of Empathy and Responsibility
Andrew's tone throughout the interview was seen as self-absorbed and lacking in empathy for Jeffrey Epstein's victims. He did not express any compassion for them and instead focused on the impact the scandal had on him, his family, and his reputation. This was a critical failure, as it alienated a public that was already concerned with the serious nature of the allegations. His use of the word ""unbecoming"" to describe Epstein's actions was seen as a gross understatement, further highlighting his perceived disconnect from the gravity of the crimes.

Inconsistent and Unbelievable Excuses
The prince's explanations for his behavior were met with widespread disbelief and ridicule. The most notorious examples include:

1) The Pizza Express alibi: He claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on the day he was alleged to have had sex with Virginia Giuffre. This highly specific and mundane alibi was seen as bizarre and unconvincing.

2) The ""inability to sweat"": When confronted with Giuffre's claim that he was ""sweating profusely"" while dancing at a London nightclub, Andrew claimed a past medical condition related to an ""adrenaline overdose"" from the Falklands War had left him unable to sweat. This response was widely mocked and seen as a desperate and outlandish excuse.

3) Staying at Epstein's home: He defended staying at Epstein's house in New York after Epstein had already been convicted of a sex offense by saying it was a ""convenient"" place to stay. This showed a startling lack of judgment and was seen as a weak justification for maintaining a relationship with a known sex offender.


A Failure to Achieve the Interview's Goal
Instead of clearing his name, the interview seemed to confirm many people's suspicions. The combination of his defensive body language, his vague denials, and his specific, yet unbelievable, excuses did more to raise questions than to answer them. A public relations expert noted that Andrew ""made it much worse"" and ""gave more oxygen to that story,"" ultimately leading to him stepping back from public duties just four days after the interview aired.",[],2025-08-12T23:56:01Z,@adforsyth
"The sweating thing is so bizarre and outlandish that I wonder if there's some truth to it.

"Here is how to get saved and be right with God;
1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in one way or another.
Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 
10. ""As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:""
11.""There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.""
12.""They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.""
23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

2-Realize that God loved us, even as sinners enough to allow Jesus to pay the price for our sins, as a free gift to whosoever accepts it.

Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB) 
8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.""
9.""Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.""
12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”

3-Confess unto God to ask to be forgiven of your sins, by accepting this freely given gift of forgiveness.

1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB)
1.""Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2.""By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.”
3.""For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
4.""And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”

Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)
9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”
10.""For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.""
13.""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”

Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)
27.""And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:""
28.""So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)
""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”

Romans 6: 23 (KJB)
“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

(An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.)
“Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.
 I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. 
I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.
I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. 
I trust in him alone to save me. 
Nothing else. 
Not my good works or anything else. 
Only Jesus. 
I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”",[],2025-07-14T11:20:15Z,@giantearth5721

"Epstein was a Mossad agent who ran a blackmail operation involving underage girls. Robert Maxwell, the father of Ghislaine Maxwell, was also a Mossad agent. Israel gave him a state funeral, and he is buried on Mount Olives. Follow the money, and you will see that all of Epstein's activities were designed to benefit Israel. Epstein had relationships with William Burns (CIA Director), Les Wexner, Ronald Lauder, Alan Dershowitz, Rupert Murdoch, Mark Zuckerberg, Ehud Barak, and Ariane Langner de Rothschild (""WSJ News Exclusive - Epstein's Private Calendar Reveals Prominent Names, Including CIA Chief, Goldman's Top Lawyer"").
Virginia Giuffre was one of the most public and outspoken victims of Epstein. They tried to kill her on March 31; her car was hit by another vehicle, leaving her seriously injured. She was hospitalized but survived. Shortly before this false flag operation to cover up the truth, which claimed Epstein acted alone and was not a spy, Virginia Giuffre was killed in her home on April 25. Her death was announced as a suicide.",[],2025-07-11T07:16:16Z,@KawaAshurSterk

"Truth is, this goes beyond the physical realm. It's a spiritual warfare more now than ever in our entire History. Sure, U can live in comfort and enjoy the benefits of this physical realm on the expense of innocent sufferers. Ima tell you how u can get rich if you want to trade a life of righteousness, for a life of pleasure in the name of sin(Guiltiness rest on their conscience) (They eat the bread of sorrow) just know everyone is ultimately and rightfully responsible for their own choices. We have been struggling because of this same systematic with It's inequalities, unjustfulness, discriminatory ways. Don't be weak, Don't give up. Have Faith, Those who have faith have it all. Those who know, Know. And you can pretend to turn the cheek. God of heaven says if you know better, then it is expected of you to do better. The lord see's all. He is the Unseen Guest. He is a Justful God. Some people are so poor that money is all they have. ICE and deportation centers are profiting from what they are doing now. ICE and detention centers for migrants are in contract with corporations who are profiting in the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE) listed under the Publicly Traded Private Prison Corporations list as ;
-The GEO Group (GEO)
-CoreCivic (CXW)
-LASalle Corrections
-Management Training Corporation

But Know this, Life and health cannot be bought. Just ask David Rockefeller about all the heart transplants and still no success. Which did happen but they manage to censor the internet. Meanwhile there is other people who have been on a waitlist for years for just 1 heart transplant. Or ask Pope Francis, He died the day before Jesus Resurrection.  Or ask  George Bush Sr. Or Elizabeth aka Alizard from england. No amount of money or social status can surpass the true riches and blessings of God of light,love and heaven. Joy, Peace, Happiness, Health, Love, Contentmen. Divine protection and guidance. Living a life in truth. True satisfaction. The true ruler, virtuous in all of his glory.

I traveled to visit, stay with,  and have dinner parties with a  convicted sex offender just months after his release from prison.

Said convicted sex offender told me that he had taken a plea deal.

I told him that because of the increased scrutiny on me we couldn't continue to be friends ( not because, you know, he is a repulsive child sex trafficker).

This was a failed PR hit job dressed up in a suit and royal entitlement.

"Many many things to un pack but the absolute non empathy for the victims made his guilt seem even more easy to see and when stated that Epstein was now dead, he unconsciously laughed or a sniggered laugh which to me gave the game away! Meaning he new exactly how Epstein was murdered and couldn’t hide his relief with his sniggered laugh which was a double edged laugh of knowing how he was murdered by the mossad agents or mi5 and his relief in Epstein being dead. The day Epstein died was the day he told the fbi that he was going to leak all his information and footage of who was at these freak offs! He went back to his cell after this meeting to snitch on all the people he had blackmailed with the footage and his testimony of what he knew. He was in a better mood than he had been in since being at the prison MCC and was happy that he knew his sentence would be radically reduced. Once this info got back to the royal family and agents the plot was put into action. An Italian mafia body builder was put into his cell the same evening when no other inmate was allowed to share a cell with Epstein whilst he was at the prison and he was on an hourly watch to make sure he didn’t commit suicide. The Italian mob guy was in for murder and he strangled Epstein to death that night whilst the prison officers were told to pretend to go to sleep and all cameras at mcc were Tyrone’s off for 2 hours so the inmate could be shipped out of the prison and could be set free at a later date from another prison. The inmates at that time gave witness statements to this but no media outlets would air this across the world. Also Virginia Duffey was murdered because she was lining up more court cases for other prominent figures that abused her..",[],2025-05-27T23:10:32Z,@imihuss009

Anyone else would have been questioned far more intensely, maybe even prosecuted, but royal family members live under a different set of laws. It’s astonishing. For this reason alone, no one should be royal. Monarchies shouldn’t exist - they’re relics of past when we didn’t know better and believed some people were inherently superior to others.

"The photograph of Prince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell, reportedly taken by Jeffrey Epstein on March 10, 2001, is supported by substantial evidence as authentic, including development records, witness testimonies, and FBI documentation. The original print is missing, likely lost during Giuffre’s move to Australia, but its absence doesn’t undermine the photo’s credibility due to scanned copies and corroborating accounts. The image remains a critical symbol of Giuffre’s allegations, though it doesn’t directly prove abuse. Claims of fakery by Andrew and Maxwell appear driven by self-interest and lack concrete evidence, making the photo a likely genuine record of a controversial moment.

The Mail on Sunday reported that the back of the original photograph bears a date stamp indicating it was developed on March 13, 2001, at a Walgreens pharmacy in West Palm Beach, Florida, near Giuffre’s then-home. This suggests the photo was a standard print from a disposable Kodak camera, making digital manipulation highly unlikely at the time due to technological limitations.

- **Photographer’s Testimony**: Michael Thomas, a photographer who worked with Mail on Sunday reporter Sharon Churcher, viewed the original print in 2011 in Australia. Thomas took 39 copies of the image (front and back) and described claims of it being fake as “ridiculous” and “absurd,” citing the physical nature of the print and its context within a collection of other photos from Giuffre’s time with Epstein.

FBI Involvement**: Giuffre stated in a 2016 deposition that she provided the original photo to the FBI in 2011 as part of their Epstein investigation. The FBI returned it after scanning, and a post on X references a CD from the FBI featuring images taken by Giuffre, suggesting official acknowledgment of the photo.

Maxwell’s Prior Statement**: In a 2015 email to lawyer Alan Dershowitz, Maxwell responded to a query about the photo’s authenticity by saying, “It looks real. I think it is.” This contradicts her later claims that the photograph was fake. (Trying to save her own skin, don’t forget she’s a convicted sex predator like Epstein so taking her word about anything is laughable)

The photo was one of several from Giuffre’s collection, kept in a white envelope and stored in a bookcase. Its existence aligns with Giuffre’s detailed accounts of being trafficked to London and meeting Prince Andrew, supported by other witnesses like Carolyn Andriano, who testified that Giuffre told her in 2001 about sleeping with Andrew. 

The photo’s physical development in 2001 predates widespread digital editing tools, and experts cited by the Mail on Sunday stated it would be “essentially impossible” to doctor a physical print convincingly at that time.

The photo was a standard print, developed at a one-hour Walgreens lab. The back shows a date stamp (March 13, 2001), and it was stored with other photos from Giuffre’s time with Epstein. The uncropped version includes a thumb, adding to its physical authenticity.

- **Giuffre’s Allegations**: Giuffre claims she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to Andrew three times in 2001 (London, Manhattan, and the Virgin Islands). The London incident, linked to the photo, is the most documented. Her accounts are supported by witnesses like Andriano and legal filings unsealed in 2019 and 2024.",[],2025-05-06T03:48:07Z,@NoSpinZone49

"HEARSAY CAN BE VERY DAMAGING FOR ANYONE – NOT LEAST HRH PRINCE ANDREW – BUT
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHERE’S THE PROOF ?

Aside from the accusations - none of which appear to have very much concrete evidence to vouch for their accuracy - I prefer to see HRH Prince Andrew, as one who can live-up to his renowned reputation, as a senior Royal Navy Officer and Combat-Served Helicopter Pilot in the Falklands War ! 

This is in addition to his exemplary conduct during the entirety of his service in *The Senior Service*; ergo The Royal Navy ! 

One thing that always strikes me - whenever I see him on video - is the fact that he is almost the living image of the Duke of Edinburgh ! 

Whatever has recently been said of Prince Andrew's life - during his Epstein years - I don't think any of his critics, in this regard, have as much as attempted to suggest that Prince Andrew participated, at any time, with under-age girls or anything else like that ?

"Virginia committed suicide this yesterday. 4 weeks ago she was in hospital claiming doctors and told her she had only days to live after a crash involving a a school bus which no one else was injured in while posting doctored photos of herself on her Social media the police did not need to investigate and denied it was serious. Is it possible that she was a fantasist of some kind? Or is it possible that her mental health had declined to where she became a fantasist over the last number of years.Is it possible that she would have had a normal life after Epstein until she went public to the world press leading her into that toxic media circus that destroyed her life? I don't doubt that Andrew had sex with her, that Epstein used her or that her life when young was awful but was she best served by going public to become media fodder for the world in the name of "" justice""?  Or was her life worth exposing Andrew and Epstein? Perhaps the world thinks it is?  Perhaps the pay out she got was so large from Andrew that she was ill prepared to deal with 25 million AUS dollars and it destroyed her. These are logical questions for us, for society but a great many people want to be hysterical and never move from "" She's a victim"".  Well she was, but a great many of the 8 billion people on this planet are in one way or the other so will we start talking about them too at some stage.",[],2025-04-26T07:31:48Z,@private-private

"On January 3, 2015, at 5:50 a.m., Andrew fired off an email to Maxwell. This was just hours after Virginia Giuffre filed court papers in Florida claiming she’d been abused by him as part of Jeffrey Epstein’s trafficking ring. In the email, Andrew wrote, “Let me know when we can talk. Got some specific questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.” Maxwell hit back quick, saying, “Have some info. Call me when you have a moment.” That’s the raw exchange—short, sharp, and loaded. “Virginia Roberts” is Giuffre’s maiden name, so it’s crystal clear who they’re talking about.

This email’s a big deal because it directly contradicts Andrew’s big BBC Newsnight interview where he claimed he didn’t recall ever meeting Giuffre. If he’s emailing Maxwell about her in 2015, it’s a stretch to say she’s a total stranger to him, right? The timing’s brutal too—Giuffre’s legal move had just dropped, so Andrew’s clearly rattled, digging for dirt or some kind of heads-up from Maxwell. Panorama also got their hands on a follow-up from Maxwell three days later, where she sent Andrew a “dossier of inconsistencies and inaccuracies” about Giuffre’s story. Sounds like a defense playbook, but it didn’t call the famous photo of Andrew with Giuffre fake—something his camp later leaned on hard.

These emails were buried in a mountain of legal docs from Giuffre’s defamation suit against Maxwell, which settled in 2017. They only popped out when the BBC started digging. In a 2016 deposition tied to that case, Maxwell got grilled about the email. She played it vague, saying she didn’t recall the specifics of their chat, just that they agreed Giuffre was “a liar.” She didn’t elaborate on why Andrew thought that or what “info” she had, but it’s sketchy as hell—two people neck-deep in Epstein’s world, scrambling to sync up their stories.

Andrew is a straight-up clown, and the dirt on him piles up like trash on a city corner. His former bodyguards, the folks who had to trail this royal disaster, ain’t got a single good word to say about him. Word is, he treated them—and pretty much everyone—like they were beneath him, like he was some untouchable kingpin. I’ll break it down with the real talk and some examples. 

First off, his ex-bodyguards have spilled some tea over the years. These guys weren’t just clocking in for a paycheck—they had to deal with Andrew’s arrogance 24/7. One story floating around from palace insiders says he’d bark orders at them like they were dogs, expecting them to jump at his every whim, no matter how petty. Think stuff like screaming at them to fetch random crap or losing it if they didn’t salute fast enough. Another time, a guard supposedly got chewed out for not opening a gate quick enough at one of his fancy pads—Andrew allegedly called him “useless” and told him to “get a real job.” (Coming from him is laughable) That’s the vibe—pure entitlement, treating people like they’re dirt under his polished shoes. When he got angry some witnessed him kicking the queens dogs out of frustration. Sad to think her dogs are with this monster now. 

Then there’s the Fergie situation—Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife. People who’ve been around them say Andrew didn’t hold back on his ex, Insiders have claimed he’d hurl insults at her like it was nothing, calling her stuff like “fat cow” or “slob” in front of staff, just to flex his cruelty. One report from a former aide said they heard him tell Fergie she was “an embarrassment” and “good for nothing” during a blowout fight—publicly humiliating her like it was sport. This wasn’t some private spat either; he’d do it where people could hear, showing off that nasty streak. Monster indeed —he’s got a rep for being a bully with zero chill.

Now, let’s get to the grimy stuff. That woman who said Andrew grabbed her breasts? That’s Johanna Sjoberg, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims. She dropped this bomb in court docs, saying back in 2001, when she was 21, Andrew got handsy at Epstein’s New York mansion. Picture this: they’re posing for a photo with a Spitting Image puppet of Andrew—already weird as hell—and she says he used the puppet’s hand to touch Virginia Giuffre’s chest while he straight-up grabbed hers with his own. She called it a “joke” they all laughed at, but it’s creepy as hell, especially knowing Epstein’s MO. Andrew’s team says it’s “categorically untrue,” but Sjoberg’s story lines up with the pattern of him being way too comfortable in Epstein’s sleazy world.

Speaking of Epstein, that foot massage tale from John Brockman? Straight-up chilling. Brockman, a big-shot literary agent, wrote about chilling at Epstein’s place in 2010 and seeing “Andy” getting his feet rubbed by two young Russian girls. He didn’t clock it was Prince Andrew at first, but when he did, it hit him—this royal dude was deep in Epstein’s orbit. If you know the Epstein case, those “massages” were the gateway to way worse. Virginia Giuffre’s said that’s how it started for her too—massages turning into abuse. Brockman’s email paints Andrew as just another creep lounging in that predator’s den, no questions asked.

Andrew’s excuses are a joke too. That “I can’t sweat” line from his BBC Newsnight interview? He said he couldn’t have been sweaty dancing with Giuffre at Tramp nightclub in 2001 ‘cause he had some Falklands War condition. Bro, the internet roasted him—people dug up pics of him dripping sweat at events, like one from 2001 at a polo match, looking like he just ran a marathon. Then he claimed he didn’t even know where the bar was at Tramp, like he’s never been. Cue more pics—him at Tramp, drink in hand, posted all over X and tabloids. Man’s a liar, and not even a good one.

That interview was a car crash. No empathy, no remorse—just a narcissist fumbling to save his ass. He called Epstein’s behavior “unbecoming” like it was a mild faux pas, not a sex trafficking nightmare. Said he stayed at Epstein’s crib in 2010 ‘cause it was “convenient,” then admitted it was a dumb move but didn’t give a damn about the victims. People on X and everywhere else were like, “This guy’s a sociopath.” The FBI’s been itching to grill him since at least 2020—US Attorney Geoffrey Berman called him out for giving “zero cooperation” despite Andrew promising on TV he’d help. If he’s so innocent, why’s he dodging them like a fugitive? Smells like guilt from a mile away.

More dirt? Virginia Giuffre’s the main accuser, saying Andrew assaulted her three times when she was 17—once at Maxwell’s, once at Epstein’s New York spot, and once on his private island. She’s got that famous pic with his arm around her, Maxwell grinning in the background. Andrew says it’s fake, but he settled with her in 2022 for millions—why pay if you’re clean? Then there’s Shukri Walker, a witness who swears she saw him at Tramp with Giuffre, even stepped on his foot and apologized. Andrew’s alibi? He was at Pizza Express in Woking with his kid. Nobody buys that—Beatrice doesn’t even remember it.

Prison? Hell yeah, he deserves it. The dude’s a disgrace—arrogant, abusive, and tied to one of the ugliest scandals ever. Bodyguards hate him, Fergie’s been trashed by him, and the Epstein stink won’t wash off. He’s a narcissistic mess who thinks he’s above it all, but the streets see through that royal bs. However, sycophants and throne sniffers like Neil Sean prefer to die on the hill of sleaze with Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell. It’s enough to turn your stomach. I prefer to die on the hill with innocent children who were troubled and taken advantage of, preyed upon by wealthy scumbags who think they’re untouchable.

"It's been said that he's not a very smart person, and this shows it. He should NEVER have denied meeting and sleeping with Virginia because he obviously did. He should have admitted it. All he had to say was he simply didn't know how old she was. She can easily pass for 20/21. Now if she thought she could trust Andrew, did she at any point ask for help? Did she ever appear distressed? Troubled? Upset? Quiet? Was she dirty? Seem malnourished? Because she's smiling in that picture, is very clean, healthy and seems very comfortable. If he saw any of those signs and NOT doing anything would make him complicit and guilty. Added she was 17. She was NOT a child. Legal consensual sex in NY is 16. So that throws that argument right out the window. Now the friendship is another story. As soon as he found out about Jeffrey even being charged with sex trafficking, he should have ended the relationship immediately. No need to travel 10 hours to end a friendship under these types of allegations. A quick phone call and conversation would have been enough to end it. For normal people anyway. He should have booked a room at a hotel beforehand and made sure the press knew WHY he was there. He admits that Jeffrey came to Beatrice,s birthday party  because he invited Gislaine and they apparently only came anywhere as a couple. In that case, I'd have ended my friendship with Gislaine because she obviously supports Jeffrey. This is common sense.

Example: ‘She made (the) allegations in a deposition - are you saying you don’t believe her?’

Normal persons answer: ‘yes, she’s lying/mistaken’

Prince Andrew: ‘That’s a difficult question to answer - I’m not in a position to know what she’s trying to achieve…’

Is it dishonourable to say ‘yes she must be because it never happened’ when someone is falsely accusing you?  I’d suggest not.

Interesting point - interviewees often prefer to say ‘I don’t recall’ rather than make an outright denial when there’s a chance that their answer can be disproven.  It’s harder to be caught in an absolute lie when you say ‘I don’t recall’ - because they have to prove the workings of someone’s mind/memory and that’s pretty difficult to do….",['You described uk'],2024-11-25T19:42:51Z,@OldCGullybloke

His arrogance is astounding. You can tell immediately he has no self awareness.,"['That’s what happens when you are a royal with no real duties. Similar to Harry and William. Harry got to be the party animal with no real responsibilities while William has been under a microscope since the day he was born.', ""You can turn the sound off and still easily tell he's lying."", 'Also no empathy, no remourse.', 'Not that you misunderstand him. He has never had to successfully navigate conversation through lies and deceit in his life because there was never a time where there was any risk of failing. So he never had to learn how to lie proper. Therefore what you get is underdeveloped child like social skills and cunning. Absolutely no cunning perhaps that’s his saving grace.

This idiot buried himself deeper and deeper. Did he have nobody guiding him clearly not. He's surrounded by people that flatter him tell him what he has to hear to try to please him that they feel honored in his presence. This guy was giving. Everything anybody could want good education the name of Prince a title his mother is a queen. And what is he done with his life seriously what has he done with his wife. Doesn't know how to manage his money. He has people around him . His mother's people that could have easily helped them financially. He could have picked a career and they would have given him the keys to the kingdom. He is literally stupid in the sense that. Knowing that Epstein was already accused. You actually go and stay with him. You're taking pictures with him. Epstein didn't think you were smart he just used you because he can have access to higher officials up there. He even told people around him that you weren't the smartest person in the world. And that's really sad to think that you were a royal. My God who let you do this interview. You should have just distant yourself from epstein.. you go to an island knowing that there's a lot of young girls coming and going you knew better because of your family how stupid could you be did you think that oh my God everybody wants to be around you to think that you are a God because of who your mother was and that you're a prince oh Lord.

"IMPO, Andrew and Epstein  needed 3-4 days to align their stories (collude)so if there was a court case, they would make sure their stories were the same.  Since they spent quiet a bit of time together, they had a lot to go over to make sure they wouldn't contradict  each other if they were questioned by authorities.  Andrew could have called or facetimed him to tell him he wasn't meeting him anymore, but then it might have been recorded.

I think it's a damming interview, and the Netflix series gives Andrew the point of no return.   Neither do I think Virginia ""Roberts"" (now) would trump up charges against the prince unless their was proof.   

His verbiage is telling ""I don't recall,  I'm convinced it never happened, I don't think it could have happened at all, I was home with the children, that's a very difficult thing to answer, I don't remember meeting her at all, I don't remember a photograph being took, I don't remember anything, I've been wracking my brain, I've been through it, and through it and through it, over and over and over again, and nothing""....His paying out 12 million pounds so the case didn't go to court is also telling.",[],2024-05-02T00:59:40Z,@brendakauffman2222

""Andie, darling boy, do you happen to know who has devoured all of my chocolates?"" the queen asked, her voice tinged with suspicion. With a nervous yet confident smirk, Andie replied, ""Oh, mummy, I haven't the foggiest notion. It must have been one of the footmen. Perhaps it's time to dismiss them for pilfering our treats."" As he spoke, chocolate wrappers spilled from his pockets, and his hands bore the telltale signs of indulgence. Queen Eliza chuckled and affectionately pinched his nose. ""Oh, Andie, my dearest darling boy, you always manage to spin a tale. Such a clever rascal you are,"" she said, pride evident in her voice. Andie beamed with satisfaction, oblivious to his transparent deception, relishing in the belief of his own cunning. Queen Eliza's laughter lingered in the air as she left Andie to his naive schemes.",[],2024-04-19T18:27:49Z,@artdeltoro

"Bad Titles

Sometimes, ancient places' honoured names,
Are given, forever, to brutes and cheap dames.
The good represent the titles of these lands 
With the care and dignity history demands.

There are, though, many a titled nightmare,
For example, ""old Randy"" and the ""spouse of Spare.""
Betraying the house whose wide open doors
By birth or fortune opened, in wealth and splendour.

The people of Sussex and York do lament
Their names being flaunted without their assent.
The world must look to those of gracious worth,
Swallow the bitter pill, and heads high, walk forth.

Why does he feel so uneasy about speaking about everything.  And why does he say he didn't party, when there are pictures of just that.

He went to NY to stay at Epsteins apartment but then while walking he said ""we can't be friends"".
So he had to stay at his place to do this?!

"Unbeleiveable. One of the things he says is "" as a man it is a positive action to have sex"". 

There are so many things you can say about this statement. 
In the context of paedophilia, human trafficking and sexual abuse it is disgusting and innappropriate obviously when it can be taken to mean a postive thing.

What he is trying to say is that ""as a man"" he would have had to act/initiate in order to participate in sex, and that is why he ""cant remember"". 

What slips off the tounge reveals an attitude towards sex implying that women *have* no agency in sex. That sex is something that happens TO women. Implying non consent, implying misogyny, implying a power imbalance.

"I don't understand why this interview caused him to be stripped of his royal titles and demoted to non-working royal status.
In the interview he may have been smug, arrogant, self-serving pompous and insensitive, but what's new or shocking about that? He didn't reveal anything new, other some nonsense about not sweating and about a trip to Pizza Express, and otherwise just claimed to have forgotten everything else. Even if he was lying why did this interview destroy him? It was just a stupid ill-advised interview making him look foolish.
On the other hand, prior to the interview he was known to be guilty of cohorting with Epstein and continuing his friendship participating in hospitality and dodgy parties with a serious sex offender and prostitute trafficker. With photographs etc to prove it. Yet he continued his royal life unaffected: that is, until the interview went out. 
It is implied that it was the interview that destroyed him and not his reprehensible behaviour. It is implied that if he hadn't done the interview, he would still today be continuing his royal duties without consequence. He should have been destroyed by his continuing association with the Epstein scandal but he was not. Instead, he was destroyed by this silly interview.

"To be this unaware of how disgusting this guy comes off is puzzling. An honest person would be outraged if they were being accused of such things.

And finally, an honest person would be outraged about the atrocities committed against these young ladies, and yet none of that was conveyed. He, infact, is still grateful for the friendship.

Porque viajas al otro lado, sales a caminar y le dices que ya no seran amigos, te quedas en su casa, asistes a una cena.  Y su novia? No hablo con ella si era la amiga y que le dijo. Conclusión quiza si cortaron amistad de manera amistosa pero este señor tenia más miedo que dijo o ha donde iba el juicio probablemente porque tenían negocios en común mas alla de las chicas que le daba sexo.  Es decir este señor es obvio que el sabia los negocios turbios pero mas le daba miedo que Epstein se le saliera algo sobre el.  Por eso no lo corto por telefono. Mentiroso. Que su ética honorable jajaj no tiene solo conexiones le importan y por eso no le importaba relacionarse con el.  Y por se escucha la entrevista mentirosa porque falta contexto, verdad, y notar que si bien no violó si se involucró en alguna ocasion con mujeres y sabia lo que ellos hacian.  Dice, que Epstein tenía conexiones jajaja y acaso el no es importante como para obtener esos contactos por su cuenta.

"Despite the following;

1. His relationship with the convicted sex offender Epstein
2. His admissions here of his close friendship with Ms Maxwell - who has now admitted to being a fixer for Epstein's sex trafficking rings
3. The complete BS he spins in this interview
4. The £12 MILLION settlement he paid to a woman - accusing him of rape - but who he claimed he never met
5. His refusal to face questioning from the DA in NYC
6. The fact that his titles have been stripped BY HIS OWN FAMILY

Despite all of this....there are many members of the general public who still advocate for this man's innocence.


He is disgraceful yes - but ultimately he has been shielded from prison by his status.

What is far far more disgraceful is the support he is given by everyday people - especially women or people who have daughters - who despite the clear cut evidence against him - continue to claim that the women accusing him are liars.

I have witnessed some supporters of this disgusting man argue that he couldn't have raped any of his accusers because they were old enough to know what they were doing and even that they 'looked older than they actually were'.

Remember all these 'excuses' ignore the fact that Andrew knew these girls were being sex trafficked by his good friend Jeffrey Epstein and his even better friend Ghislaine Maxwell.",[],2024-04-09T01:32:42Z,@randyschwaggins

"For some who are not aware, both female accusers of Prince Andrew (gold diggers) were of legal age when they apparently knew him.

Additionally, 17 is NOT illegal in America. 17 is legal in many US states.. Each state has varying legal ages.  Some US states allow 12 and 13 year old children to marry with parental approval.

Regarding the Andrew and Virginia fiasco, here is the abbreviated factual context for the record sourced from documented news files: -


Andrew was another privileged simpleton (ergo, Harry) who, if one believes that the infamous photo is genuine, he knowingly had his picture taken at a house party w/ Virginia Giufre, who was of LEGAL age when she,  Maxwell & Epstein targeted him. Andrew met hundreds of adoring women during his early years when he travelled globally and often. 

It is highly possible that Andrew met Virginia Giufre at the house party but does not recall her later: Virginia Giufre is but one of many hundreds of women who put themselves in Andrew's path not including those who were introduced to him by friends. He attended nightclubs & parties: many women threw themselves at him. It is well documented by numerous media articles and photographs which validate their reporting on Andrew's travels, golf, skiing & partying his way across Europe and North America.

IF the one, by now famous but benign photo of Andrew with Virginia Giufre had been genuine, he knowingly had his photo taken with her, smiling at the camera. Critically and relevantly, it is not the behavior of a man who thinks he's with a prostitute! That infamous photo has, however, since been proven by experts to be fake.


Unfortunately, Andrew acted without care and in inviting his then very wealthy socialite friends Maxwell & Epstein into his parent's quarters, he was very remiss in also taking their photos while his then friends sat in the throne room. Incredibly disrespectful of all.

Maxwell and Epstein were famous, globally renowned socialites & celebrities whom MANY politicians and stars knew and socialized with. Andrew happened to be one of many in their circle. 


Virginia Giufre very strategically targeted Andrew many years after having met him and falsely accused him of S.A. She had planned to extort him for money with a story that Andrew had slept with her. Note, again, Virginia Giufre had been 17 years old when she and Andrew apparently met. If so, she was legally an adult.


Virginia Giufre only went after Andrew many years after apparently having met him. She targeted him only. None of her other wealthy clients.  Again, she had been an adult, of legal age when she claims to have met Andrew.


Although Andrew was willing & wanting to defend himself in Court, the late Queen did not want her family drawn into such a spectacle so she gave Andrew the money from her private account, NOT taxpayer's funds to settle w/ the demands of VirginiaGiufre, who readily accepted the cash and withdrew her threat of court action. 

Because the majority of Britons had been embarrassed by this incident, the late Queen set the example of symbolic regret for her people by stripping Andrew of his military titles and Patronages. He served during the Falklands War so he was allowed to keep his medals.

Andrew's arrogance  - like Harry’s  - flunked the T.V. interview however.


Andrew is now only seen at private events with the Royals as family. 


UPDATE 2023: Virginia Giufre, whom many refer to as a repeat liar  is now being accused of sexually assaulting a young woman and of attracting & grooming other young women.

USA Judge Dismisses  Virginia Giufre Case Against Prince Andrew 2023


https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/prince-andrew-virginia-giuffre-accuser-lawsuit-settlement



Update. Another Epstein girl has exited the closet and is only now making accusations of SA against Andrew: the same M.O. and goal as that of Virginia Giufre. Johanna Sjoberg is now alleging the prince groped her at Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 while playing with a comic puppet of himself. Buckingham Palace had previously said her allegations are ""categorically untrue."" 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-documents-1.7074336

This latest woman to stake a claim against Andrew was also of legal age when she knew Andrew and targeted him. She ""sat on his lap"". She knew what she was doing. Now, decades later she too is looking for fame and fortune. 


Regardless, Prince Andrew's reputation is completely unsalvagable. He must retire and go peacefully into the sunset along with the untrustworthy & unproductive Beatrice, Eugenie, Harry & Meghan. They will never again be a Working Royals. Finis.  Show them the public approval ratings (or lack thereof if they do not comprehend).

The major difference between Bunker Harry & #PrinceAndrew is that  Andrew NEVER bullied, abused, lied about or slandered his family out of envy, for revenge, fame and fortune.


Prince Andrew NO longer has 24/7 police protection.  He has ONLY what Harry should receive and it is on an As Needed Basis per King Charles sharing of HIS Security Services.



Charles and family must show a united front.

Andrew's ex wife earns her own living as a successful author. The two if them will be fine.

As for Beatrice & Eugenie, cut ties with them as well. They can NEVER be trusted per their behavior towards Catherine & William and their historic alliance with the Duplicitous Duo, Harry & Meghan who must also be cut loose.



Meghan Markle to be called in Court Deposition against Prince Andrew re. Virginia Giufre and their Yacht Girl days with Jeffrey Epstein.

Quote from the lawyer, Mr. David Boies about calling on #MeghanMarkle in a Court Deposition against #PrinceAndrew because she ""knew him well and saw everything""...!!! 👀

https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-could-testify-in-prince-andrew-lawsuit-lawyer-says-2021-12

Many have for long suspected that Meghan Markle was deliberately placed in the path of dim #PrinceHarry by nefarious powers. #MeghanAndHarryEXPOSED could be capable of anything, to be enemies of the state and for certain they are of the #BritishMonarchy .

If Harry is able to obtain his desperately sought after #IPP status he will gain access to state level documents as well as diplomatic protection.

"Soooo many things wrong with this man. I could fill a book. But one of the most insane and horrific, to the point of wanting to shake him and scream profanities at him, is when he describes his conversation with Epstein in 2010. Saying that he was ending the friendship due to the scrutiny on himself as a member of the royal family. That it would be inappropriate for them to be seen together. Not something to the effect of “you have been convicted of sex crimes against a minor; one of the most disgusting and heinous things a person could ever do; therefore I want nothing to do with you. You are an evil human being and I’m horrified that I ever thought of you as a friend”. He only ends the friendship due to the optics of it all. I don’t understand how someone could think that that makes sense and still consider themselves to be a good person. 
The lack of intelligence and any kind of self awareness that would lead a person to think that it makes sense to say that he went to have a public, in person conversation to tell someone  that you can’t see them anymore. It’s inconceivable.  
He says that we have to remember that at the time he was the patron of the NSPCC’s full stop campaign, he was supposed to be a champion for children. Yet there is no mention of him chastising Epstein during that conversation, defending the children he has been empowered to protect, not does he express any disgust in Epstein’s behaviour. Which leads to, why would he be disgusted if he, himself was exhibiting the same behaviour. He gives himself away over and over throughout the interview. 
He is the lowest form of human. Someday he will have to answer for what he has done, even if it’s not in this lifetime. 
He is the lowest form of human.

Look Andrew was set up because that was the business of Maxwell and Epstein. Hence all their video footage. They got money out of rich men by blackmail. And you may depend both of those two would have hidden their practises from Andrew. Tha case is not about his friendship its about Andrew forcing sex on a minor. I think Andrew is being candid and he was honourable. The way the BBC nagged him into an interview by coercion and gentle persuasion just to nail him. You can tell that interviewer believed he was guilty before the interview  i am convinced Andrew did not rape Virginia. She knew perfectly well what she was doing  Why do you plebs get such pleasure in levelling or trying to level the aristocracy. I think this is grossly unfair because it was the producer from the BBC who kept sending emails nagging him to do the interview with the sole intention of humiliating him. When will aristocrats stick to their own people because they need to.

Personally, I have things from my childhood that are blocked out or blurry... due to trauma & a seizure condition, which is a natural effect.. but the extent to which this guy stutters through the ENTIRE interview (does he have a stuttering condition?) & the STORIES, including ""I have a medical condition & I don't sweat, or at least I didn't sweat at the time""... there's things he says that you want to believe & then there's all these other things that sounds like he's countering it himSelf.
I will say what he said about how people generally act differently around him as part of the royal family & that you don't go into certain environments necessarily looking to notice certain things about someone, until you look back & question certain things later on... those statements DO have categorical validity... & I think the fact that he's aware that people do act a certain way around royalty, I can understand that... 
HOWEVER, it does call to mind that if anyone & everyone around Epstein ""knew"" SOMETHING was up with him of a questionable nature, even if they didn't know EXACTLY what, but they could tell, then you do have to wonder why Andrew NEVER noticed things as he claims, when he got to know the guy enough to spend time on his private properties... even to take a casual stroll with intent... yet why go out in the public with someone, that you claim the intention in speaking to them was to tell them that you DIDN'T want to be seen with them? That's just totally counterproductive! Like you couldn't just meet up with the guy somewhere private & have that sort of convo? Or have your secretary send him an official letter saying the prince no longer wants to maintain contact due to the allegations circulating about him... & if you had the guys' number, then why not send him a text saying as much?

"It’s now fact that Virginia GIUFFRE lied in her Statement to the Court re Prince Andrew - her solicitor has come forward and said so, so no argument there. Official Papers from USA COURT in MAXWELL CASE have proven, that the teenage Virginia was ‘no innocent’ young girl - she accepted from Epstein US $$150,00 to seduce Andrew & have sex with him …as part of a plot, to have something on him.   While being seduced by a young prostitute, experienced in these matters, Andrew did not ask her for her Birth Certificate - however - in U.K. such a coupling at 17, is not against the law, as everyone knows.  It could have been any guy taken in, even those hypocrites in Fleet Street, not adverse to a quickie themselves.    These US COURT PAPERS also revealed the shocking fact that Virgina GIUFFRE was a ‘’PIMP’’ … equal to a Brothel Madam, &, she had been at 17/18 + procuring young girls off the streets, runaways, &, Pimping them out to Epstein [ others ] for money - how industrious of her - obviously when it comes to earning ‘’money’’ any which way, Virginia is up for it !!    Now these ‘’facts’’ that were proven in Court in USA - with WITNESSES & STATEMENTS - were very far from the ‘’pitiful tale’’ that was ‘’acted out’’ to land Andrew is the deepest shit.  Obviously, when it comes to lies, opportunism, exploitation, Virginia GIUFFRE for money, is extremely well versed - equipped - to ACT IT OUT.   Andrew was the ‘’mark’’ the ‘’patsey’’  ….. being from the Royal Family, a ‘’Sitting Duck’’ for a scam of this kind.    10 years later - or was it or longer - Virginia long forgotten - in need of money …. the Scam was put in place - not by Epstein, but by his named Co-Conspirator  - millions of $$$$ / ££££ - to be extorted one way or the other. The British Press had a field day - there were no questions asked - Andrew was immediately found ‘’guilty’’ from the ‘’get go’’ ….. the Wolves closed round, it was journalistic ‘’feeding time’’ to sell newspapers!!    Ah the poor innocent girl - oh - how terrible - salivating - journalists could not have been more happy, pigs in muck, as it were, all at the trough.   Of course it was 99% certain, they has in youth had sex with a girl of 17 in the U.K. but hey - forget that - the HYPOCRISY WON THROUGH.    THE QUEEN DEVASTATED, sadly never knew the real truth she died in ignorance of it, such is life, it was a terrible blow, that no one gave a thought - it might be a set up, so may years had passed, memories gone / faded the scam was full proof.    Andrew left ‘holding the baby’’ well and truly stuffed a lamb to the slaughter - not the sharpest knife in the block - was SHAFTED!! Called a ‘Peadophile’ it was a catastrophic Desaster - ruined him - yet it was all in reality a ‘’set up’’ planned / executed for money - many years before by EPSTEIN & VIRGINIA GIUFFRE - with Epstein dead - his vile reputation known, Virginia knew she had Andrew as U.K. Royalty - by the balls - it cost him Millions of £££££ ‘s  on lies, but it’s not just the money - it’s ruined his life, it’s appalling.","['Mate, wtf is wrong with you']",2024-02-05T18:39:33Z,@LyndaFindon

Imagine being accused of something like that and having to rack your brain for whether it happened or not. \n\nThen the sweating, pizza express garbage was just way over the top. It’s like that Ian Huntley interview where he went into major detail about why he was outside talking to them, details of his dog being messy blah blah blah. It seems people like to come up with a very thorough story of why they’re innocent, and overdo it by rambling nonsense. \n\nThe fact he refused to criticise Virginia was telling too.

"ANDREW IS LOYAL TO ROYAL FAMILY, TO THE LATE QUEEN & HIS BROTHER - & - unlike Harry was indeed a real War Hero having flown a helicopter in battle conditions, on many occasions, his courageousness cannot be undermined.  True he was ‘’scammed’ by a proven teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE - as is 100% confirmed by US COURT MAXWELL Documents, her own recent comments & even her solicitor has recently said, she lied about her connection / activities with Andrew.    Facts are, Andrew was smeared, set up, &, tried and found guilty by the U.K. Press - in fact - there is an accusation, that the Daily Mail sent a journalist to Australia, to see Virginia, with the intention of having her attack, &, tell stories about Prince Andrew, re Epstein, ‘’juicing it up’’, to create as much harm as possible, to destroy his reputation, that has in fact been the case; backing him into a corner to:  ‘’PAY UP MILLIONS’’ on what are seen now,  as mostly gross lies by a teenage Prostitute for money - who was paid by Epstein to seduce Andrew, have sex with him for $$ 50,000 ….. it was a set up, a honey trap, whatever you want to call it by Epstein & his teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE ……. to enable them to extort / blackmail him for money later - in fact it’s very clear in this instant as is now ‘confirmed 100%’  that Andrew was the sucker - the VICTIM - of a planned sting …. he’s certainly paid dearly for it and been wrongly blamed as a Peadophile - which is totally wrong !!!

"I am going to state my opinion about this story and Prince Andrew that may not be popular and may go against the way a lot of people feel about this story, but I will say it anyway. 

I think that Prince Andrew probably did have sex with Virginia Roberts but I definitely do not believe that he raped her or forced her to do anything. 
By her own admission, Jeffrey Epstein paid her for sleeping with Prince Andrew and I believe the amount that she claimed that she was paid was approximately $15,000. In fact, another young girl who worked for Epstein at the time in 2001, named Carolyn Andriano, gave an interview in which she claimed that Virginia Roberts bragged about having slept with Prince Andrew. She said that Roberts thought that it was ""pretty cool"" to have slept with Prince Andrew. Carolyn Andriano went on to say ""I don't think she was coerced into doing anything"".  She also said that she does not believe that Virginia Roberts deserved any compensation at all for sleeping with Prince Andrew. She was referring to the millions of dollars that Virginia Roberts was suing Prince Andrew for.  

My personal belief is that Prince Andrew is an arrogant foolish guy that feels entitled by his royal status, but I do not believe that he is a criminal or a rapist. Just an arrogant fool. Roberts was also 17 years old at the time which was a legal age to have sex in many venues. She was very young but not a child. When she was recruited to work for Jeffrey Epstein, Roberts was working in the locker room at the Mar A Lago country club in Florida. She was probably making approximately minimum wage, in other words, just several dollars an hour. From her lawsuits against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew, she would go on to become a multi-millionaire. I have read that she now lives in a $1.9 million dollar home in Australia and she has millions of dollars. If she never met Jeffrey Epstein, she might very well still have some poorly paid job as she does not have a higher education. Although she would never admit it publicly, I would not be in the least surprised if she secretly believes that meeting Jeffrey Epstein was the luckiest thing that ever happened to her. I do not think that Prince Andrew is a predator. I think that he is just an arrogant dope. I think that it is Virginia Roberts who is the predator. I think she is not much more than a predatory liar who wanted to make money out of this story.","['Well said my friend, sense at last!!!']",2024-01-15T23:25:24Z,@jameskellogg1905

"SARAH HAS BEEN LOYAL, PATIENT, HELPFUL, WORKED HARD - SHE DESERVES TO BE BACK IN ROYAL FOLD - after the Sting Andrew has had put on him - Andrew foolishly got friendly with Epstein who wanted to use Andrew for his legitimate business reasons - however - he set Andrew up, with teenage Prostitute & Pimp Virginia GIUFFRE paying GIUFFRE very well US $$15,000 to seduce and have sex with Andrew - to use against him later - it’s called Blackmail, a filthy business, illegal of course, but both GIUFFRE & EPSTEIN were on the wrong side of the Law in their dealings together.   It was recently confirmed from US COURT PAPERS IN MAXWELL CASE that Virginia GIUFFRE  17/18 acted as a teenage PIMP for Epstein, witnesses in the Maxwell case gave evidence, confirming this - GIUFFRE would troll around looking for young street girls, runaways, pay them money - & - PIMP them out to Epstein for a lot of money — no innocent Virginia a paid sex worker at 17 & acting as a PIMP as well ……….all those newspaper articles painting her as an innocent girl, lol, sexually exploited by Andrew, is a load of bullshit, lies, far from it - Andrew was the Mark - the Sucker - lured into a trap by Epstein & Virginia - lol - what a fool Andrew was to befriend Epstein, who only wanted to use him - & - latterly Blackmail him !!!      Andrew as paid out money to Virginia GIUFFRE on a pack of lies - millions of pounds - as he was tried and found guilty in the Press - what a set up - his reputation destroyed on a pack of lies - as the Queens son he was always vulnerable to a ‘’sting’’ of this kind - rumour has it that a U.K. NEWSPAPER JOURNALIST went to Australia to talk Virginia GIUFFRE into accusing Andrew & a story was concocted  -  why would a newspaper want to deliberately hurt Andrew - ummmm - who is behind it - Andrew has enemies it seems  HYPOCRITES that mean him harm - most of whom it’s likely had sex at 17 - with a girl the same age  [ not a teenage prostitute ] and the girls were not paid thousands of US $ to sleep with them - so it’s hard to understand the ‘’outrage’’ now the truth is known, Andrew was in fact the victim of a set up - its admitted now - you would think these Hypocrites would shut up - but no - they are still after blood - spite / malice it continues ….",[],2024-01-15T17:06:47Z,@LyndaFindon

"Greetings. 
From what I know, I studied, investigated and found out that what is sought and investigated apart from carrying out a justice process for possible witnesses and victims of a purely political case, is to investigate whether the possibility that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered is true and supplanted by some aspiring public politician when he was younger and worked as a banker; I believe what should be investigated is that people or individuals currently react within various types of public or private businesses, or how they reacted within various companies or operations upon learning of the case since they used aliases or nicknames referring to names similar to those mentioned. found on Epstein's famous list.
What happens if an individual named Daniel Miles Alejandro, who was or is ex-military and who works in a security company that monitors pests and in his free time plays video games or through short radio signals using the alias George Lucas? Or is George Lucas pedo's besieged and harassed by young men, young women, boys or girls since they work for political links of some official political party and they want to blackmail him? ... What happens to individuals who still have sexual fantasies when remembering their first kisses or caresses with a girl or boy who was the same age when they kissed or met? ...
What happens to those who, being minors, had the pleasure and pleasure of being able to love their platonic loves in a real and reciprocal way or who had the pleasure of fulfilling their love and/or sexual fantasies in an emotionally intelligent, mature, reciprocal, respectful way, loving and/or authoritative without ever suffering violent sexual abuse?... What if a conglomerate of abusive and desperate people attacked a few individuals who had the opportunity to work formally as clerks, bankers or congressmen? A boy or girl can and could even violate or/and sexually abuse any adult through political acts, blackmail and extortion... I believe that even minors should always take responsibility for their acts and omissions.

I believe that even minors should always take responsibility for their acts and omissions. 

I have known and seen cases where adults disguise themselves as children using certain types of body technology, I have also seen cases of adult individuals and dwarf adults who, to steal and impersonate children or minors, use technologies on their bodies to be able to see themselves. and to be able to function like children. 
I also know of cases of minors who, because they are very responsible for their actions, may obtain official legal and governmental permissions to be treated as adults thanks to their individual and personal merits, and also thanks to their responsibility. 

Although there are also completely opposite cases in which minors who commit a lot of crimes are sentenced to the death penalty. I believe that what should be investigated in a legal and fair manner is the adequate justice process to condemn sexual rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and, to a greater extent, sexual violation of defenseless individuals and persons, whether or not they are age minors.",[],2024-01-14T15:36:29Z,@Tayler_H_L_D-A.M

"The Duke of York had been caught strolling in Central Park with Epstein as well as peeking out the front door of his sprawling Upper East Side mansion — even though Epstein had already done jail time for sex with a minor.

“He went to see a friend to tell them he couldn’t be their friend any more,” the source insisted.

Still, the breakup did not appear too painful — with Andrew seen grinning happily as he waved goodbye to a female visitor to Epstein’s mansion, and his host throwing him a celebrity-packed party. Guests included Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Charlie Rose and George Stephanopoulos, The Post reported a few months later.

Authorities later found a “vast trove of lewd photographs” and child porn at the mansion where the British royal stayed.

no doubt saville was supplying children to all of them andrew included no doubt. The media mentions saville was a monumental peadophile/satanist and supplier of children to the wealthy elite, yet they stop there and never mention who he was supplying them to! it doesnt take to much thought to figure out who...the royal family are a facade, hiding a darker evil...and andrew is up to his neck in it! then there the ties of ghislaine maxwell and jeffery epstein with the monarchy.

"The Presence of ""young girls"" is not a criminal offence, they need to be able to prove those girls are being sold, rented, used, abused.. etc.. if they cannot prove this.. then it's purely circumstantial... it is safe to say that Andrew, like his brothers is abit of a dunce.. our royals aren't that bright, esp on the male side of the family.. but that is not evidence of wrong doing.  I need to see actual evidence before I will judge a Hero of our country.  Dancing with a 17 yr old or even having sex with her, is not a crime.  And without witnesses, there will never be enough evidence to prove it as he denies it.  Doesn't matter if she made 1 legal dep or 100.. if she is lying. She is still a liar. And without evidence to prove she's telling the truth, I can only judge that she is a gold digger liar.

She said when Andrew came down early to see what was going on, they were all panicking.  He also brought one of his daughters with him!!  He said they were going out for coffee or some other BS, so he let her sit there and listen to all of that about her father.  Father of the Year material right there!  So the producer at the end of the interview, was terrified they would get a call the next day saying in no way was the BBC allowed to show that footage, but she wasn't sure because Andrew seemed pretty pleased with himself.  So the producer asked Andrews assistant, ""so how do you think it went""?, and she said ""Wasn't he marvelous""?!!  The producer was shocked, and really wasn't sure it would go to air until the moment it did.  Andrew thought he had suitably impressed everyone, and offered them a tour of the Palace!!

Why would a Prince care?  Because maybe the Commoner had some dirt on him that could be a very inconvenient truth if disclosed?

"The timeline of events is very telling .. Prince Andrew ceasing contact with Epstein as he says 'after he was aware he was under investigation later in 2006' then in 2008 Epstein was found guilty and was jailed .. so now Epstein is a CONVICTED peodophile and Prince Andrew was still not in contact with Epstein. Then on Epstein's release within months he WAS in contact with him in 2010, staying in his New York Mansion .. why was it all suddenly okay to do that?  If it was okay not to be in contact with Epstein for all that time why resume contact?  Why not go through Ghislaine Maxwell to explain sorry but can't have anything to do with Epstein because of what's happened.  Why not even get the Palace Staff to do that? Then to go out in public with Epstein having said to tell him he could no longer have anything to do with him was why he went to see him just doesn't make sense.

1) At 13:42 (I think), when the interviewer mentions the literary agent who was present and remembers seeing Prince Andrew there, he looks surprised, leans forward and says ""really"", which seems to indicate (to me at least) that he knows him. Yet once she's told him of the agent's testimony, he suddenly denies all knowledge of him. It's a very sudden volte-face.
2) The whole business about the photo: even if he wanted to deny sleeping with Virginia Roberts, making a thing about the photo possibly being fake is just stupid and he gets properly tangled up in it. Why not just say something like, ""Yes that's me, yes that's a photo of me with her, which she asked for given I'm royalty. No, it wasn't a good idea in hindsight, especially with my arm around her; but a photo, even a photo like that, doesn't prove we had sex""? It's not a great line, but it's better than the ""it might be faked"" line which got him in even more of a mess.","[""He's so stupid 🤣🤣🤣"", '13:52 He says no but he nods no meaning he did']",2023-07-27T12:55:19Z,@stejjie

"It was a ""convenient place to stay"" bro, your royal blood. Im sure MANY people wouldnt mind you crashing at their place. But he probably has enough money to go where he pleases. But if he wanted out then im sure someone wouldve been sent to get you. So it makes absolutely no sense. Then you remember he was there to ""end the friendship"" while doing ""business"" sounds to me like it was a last hoorah and it's disgusting. Since he could've called and achieved the same thing. But now I'm sure someone else has stepped up to fill Epstein's role. 😣


Epstein taking pictures tracks with what we know about him having lists and keeps proof of people visting him. So, when he gets caught he couldve took a bunch of people down with him.

"Poor Andrew. His answers are too long and are not affinitive in saying “No, this is not true.” 
Had he been better versed on short, precise, denials, he would’ve been more believable. For a worldly man,  he comes across incapable of denying anything. For example: let’s say a cookie is missing and his mother were  to just say “Andrew did you take the last cookie?” He would stamper around to say, “I don’t recall seeing a cookie. I know that’s the cookie dish but I wish I would’ve known there was a cookie there”. All which makes it sound like he ate the last cookie. Instead, he should’ve said: “no, I didn’t take the cookie “
Just my humble opinion. He doesn’t even appear to look prepared for the interview either. He needs a better team to help him prepare to answer succinctly.. in any future interviews of this nature. You can still tell the truth, but do it distinctly, and with brevity, and with conviction. Being nice during this interview, totally destroyed his credibility. I want to believe him, but like so many of the other comments, he doesn’t not come across believable for the reasons I outlined above. 😢",['Blah blah. He guilty'],2023-07-12T09:38:15Z,@sandysea4242

"Love that I'm not the only one revisiting this treasure. I appreciate BBC for never turning off this comment section. Let's continue to keep this case alive that way!
Some moments that stood out to me during this revisit, this interview is just pure gold:

10:16 the way he corrected himself from ""what I was doing"" to ""what he was doing""
15:28 ""the fact of the fatter is""
16:41 his answer to the question if he regrets his friendship with Epstein (summarised but literally his words): ""I still not, for the reason being that the people that I met because of him were actually very useful."" you know his subconscious isn't thinking about business partners
17:16 just one of multiple times he tries to justify his whereabouts by saying he was there because of Ghislaine. Oh I see, that makes things so much better :')
27:43 ""I can absolutely categorically tell you that it never happened"" while also insisting that he has no recollection whatsoever, but oh, that's specifically the part that he does recollect and it's true :')
29:31 the confidence in his ""yes"" and realising it 
36:32 is he willing to testify under oath: in his words he would be ""duty bound to do so"" (just one example of his ambiguous answers)
38:21 scornfully laughing when recalling the death of his friend and continuing to calmly describe what his inflictions were found to look like
40:35 about the same thing as previous  


His most nervous and unsure moments are equally as funny as the moments where he seems to feel most confident.

2:20 ""I never have really partied.""
4:50 birthday party? ""No it was a straightforward shooting weekend (???)""
8:30 Was it the right thing to do? I had to go there in person to tell him 'naughty, naughty' and that I couldn't be seem with him, in person, since he got caught.
12:00 Staying with a convicted sex offender because it was a convenient place to stay. Hindsight 20/20, just a mistake because Prince Andrew is ""too honorable.""
18:22 Roberts discusses allegations of being sex trafficked to Prince Andrew. Literally impossible, Andrew doesn't know where the bar is in Trampt (?). He also doesn't drink. He also knows by date that he was at home with the kids.

20:23 He went to Pizza Express, super memorable, weirdly distinctly. ""Oh yes I remember that.""
21:20 ""She was very specific about that night. She describes dancing with you and you profusely sweating."" Andrew has a medical condition from being shot at because he had an overdose of adrenaline that makes sweating literally impossible. He's since recovered from this condition.
23:30 Photographs of photographs of photographs - no recollection of the photograph with Virginia Roberts.
30:58 For a man, sex is a positive act so he would totally remember having sex with Virginia Roberts but he doesn't.
33:59 ""You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on.""

"A room full of party goers, orgies, threesomes oh………and Andrew. Imagine all those years that went by & not one word was said! That’s where those that hold highly regarded titles cannot risk their reputations being soiled in any way shape or form.
Are we honestly to be believe that certain persons within the royal family weren’t made aware of a situation that could cause irreparable damage to the monarchy. 

Let’s face it…………any human being that had “allegedly” raped a minor, would almost certainly fear themselves being exposed within the community they live in either by the victim, eye witness’s or by word of mouth.
Would Andrew have taken that of shaming the Monarchy. Of course not!! Therefore I truly believe the royal family protected Andrew all them years ago by using their wealth in return for peoples/victims silence.

It’s an absolute insult paying a woman off that’s made an allegation of rape against you & not only that he should of been charged with the crime, investigated then tried in a court of law. 


The king then disciplined his brother in the most punishable way possible. Removing his title & banning him from Buckingham Palace. 

That should do it Charlie!!! 

I know I’ve rattled on a bit but I was so passionate about this family keeping up our British heritage, Andrew basically revealed the real him in this interview, fiddling around if he were a little boy playing with an elastic band in his hands. Fibbing his way through the interview. I wonder how he feels now knowing the famous photograph has been proven to be real.

Then he goes on to say he kept interacting with Epstein becasue of Ghislaine.. he went to Palm Beach Florida house, to see his friend Ghislaine, the invitation to Sandringham for a small shooting weekend was to Ghislaine and JE was her ""Plus-1"", he invited Ghislaine to Windsor Castle for Beatrice's 18th birthday party and she brought JE as her date.

@18:50 is my favorite part of this interview: Prince Andrew has NEVER been held accountable for his actions in life. So what happens when you’re not held accountable? You lack empathy. You also become a terrible liar. He’s God awful at lying. When someone asks you “have you slept with a teenager” you’re supposed to say “NO! I would never do such a thing. That is disgusting.

"It is probably difficult for people in Britain to understand the  rise and wealth of certain people like Epstein. The financial world as we have now seen with Bitcoin is odd. In Britain I think that parentage, school and university as well as the newspaper you read would give one a good idea about people, their ideas and their lifestyle. Epstein had tiers of friends..There were carefully cossetted people whose social standing and wealth brought kudos to his enterprises and then there were others who perhaps were not so innocent or pleasant and were only too happy to enjoy the fruits of the seamier side of the Epstein business.
 It was interesting that The Duke of York was offered the use of houses when in America. A famous American lawyer fell into the same trap. He stayed , at Epstein's invittion at one of his mansions. Later he was accused by the same person who accused The Duke of York. He decided to write a book about her allegations and document exactly why and how she was lying. His book is called "" The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of MeToo"" by Alan Dershowitz. 
The young woman who accused both Alan Dershowitz and The Duke of York has now said in a public news conference that she was mistaken. A bit late, having detroyed The Duke of York and left a smear on Dershowitz. A disgrace. 
Before anyone criticizes The Duke please check out the facts. 
The case against  Maxwell will hopefully come to trial (she is in prison now) and then we might find out what, who and when all this took place. She will presumably want some sort of clemency and therefore will 'spill the beans' on what was real and what was simply defamatory make-believe for blackmail purposes or merely to disguise the real trafficking in young women. 
It has to be said that President Trump rescued one of the young women who worked for him at Mar a Lago, from the Epstein trafficking or whatever it was that was happening at his neighbour's mansion. He said, cryptically that he had not spoken to Epstein for 15 years, that was presumably when he was told about the young woman  who worked for him and when he rightly intervened .",[],2022-12-31T04:50:08Z,@joseeallyn9950

"Giving this interview was a massive mistake by prince Andrew. He behaved evasively with certain questions and he probably shagged some of the young WOMEN and you don't ask for ID before sex. The woman who said they had sex was 17 at the time so it was perfectly legal so he would have come out better if he'd owned having sex with her IMO. The woman in question was sexually mature and experienced and she was perfectly happy to sleep with anyone because she will have made good money with free drugs and private jets and yachts mixing with powerful billionaires.

I don't class what they did as trafficking because to me that's forcing women and girls to prostitute themselves without them getting paid. These young girls knew what they were there for and it wasn't their scintillating wit and stock market advice.

"He blinks too much, and looks at the floor and laterally, but never really faces her for long enough.!

He was lost for words, saying that , "" I had to show leadership""  when there was no one to lead, as  he acted and he went alone!!!   
His mental age is far below his physical age. He knows exactly what he did, was caught and is now acting  like a puppy with his tail in between his legs, feeling somewhat guilty, but not fully guilty, as his lack of  inherent human sensitivity  does not permit  him, and it seems to be a congenital mental disorder,  Being somewhat spoilt and blinded by his Royal benefits and upbringing, he misinterpreted his role in society  and he lived his life using  uncalibrated  non standard social measures.  When questioned he is behaving exactly like Bishop Peter Ball and Cardinal George Pell and all those that assisted them!!!. Many people sailing in the same boat of ""social power"" react in  the same manner when they have to face the social storm of their own doing.!

"Sex addicts are very good at ""forgetting"" things.  ""I can't remember"" is a super common response. So convenient.  They lie to others. They lie to themselves. And they've lied so many times to themselves that they start to eventually convince themselves the lies are the truth.  It is very easy for sex addicts to forget the ""sex acts"" they participated in because it goes against every single moral code they say they ascribe to uphold. It's a delusion of self if that is even possible. His interview is classic.  He got caught holding the bag but yet he's gaslighting everyone.  It's the ultimate form of reality manipulation. And, it's abusive behavior any way you slice it.  He proved he was lying by paying out money to keep his victims from testifying in court. Absolutely pathetic. And, Prince Andrew won't get better until he checks himself into a sex addiction treatment center. His legacy is ruined. But, at least at this point in his life, he can save himself by getting help. Unfortunately the same can not be said for Jefferey.  His addiction was so entrenched he would rather take his life rather than face the whole world and feel the shame of what he had done. But for any sex addict, it starts with being honest with themselves. The addiction bubble needs to pop. He needs help. He is leading a double life. And he won't get well until he gets into treatment.

Perhaps, their parents are enjoying the gifts of a bramd new phone or their children supplenting grocery or house rent. By the way, when a woman commits the same offence, who talks much about it ?

"On the second viewing you notice the little traps she sets for him and how he stumbles into them. E.g. he seems to admit the foot massage 10 minutes after vehemently denying that it ever happened when he is distracted by a question with a different thrust.

What is interesting is why he chose to defend himself in this particular way. He could have said that as a famous person people often ask him to photograph themselves with him and he assumes that the background of the photo could have been just that but he does not  specifically recall it being taken or the identity of the person with him in the photo.

Why did he choose to insinuate that the photo was a fake? The position of his hand is not all that incriminating or suggestive so why does he say its not his hand?

Why did he choose to say that he went Epstein's house to break up with him rather than to challenge him with regards to his conviction which as a friend would justifiably (perhaps) seem perplexing. He could have said that he found it hard to believe at first and wasn't emotionally ready to break up immediately or believe the story.",[],2022-10-20T00:00:38Z,@compartsrecoveries2048

"I feel such deep empathy for all the people involved in Epstein's world, the poor girls who were violated, the people like Andrew who wanted to know and be a part of the movers and shakers of the world. Epstein knew and associated with very powerful business people.  Andrew has told you with his own words, he wanted to be a part of that.  Epstein and his girlfriend used Andrew's status, and all of those other celebrities' , and the young girls,  for their own personal gratification. Andrew being the fourth wheel in a really big cog probably wanted to be a part of this high powered financial status group to demonstrate his own worth as a savvy businessman with connections to the Firm. Birds of a feather do not always flock together for same reasons.  When I found out that this photo was a photo of a photo, it is also plausible that Epstein planned on blackmailing Andrew at some point. I feel so sorry for everyone Epstein involved in his sick games, most of all the young and naïve girls, and yes,  I also feel sorry for Andrew, he was played, and in a very public way.  Until this interview I had already pre-judged Andrew as I had heard rumors from disgruntled staff, but I think Andrew was being as straightforward as he legally could in this interview, he just had too much to lose otherwise. I expected him to be evasive at every question, but he answered as much as he could legally.  I waited a long time to see this interview and I am glad I saw it, and everyone can pass judgement on all the people involved, but I still have doubt about the extent of Andrew's involvement.  So, let us just deal solely with what facts we do have.  One picture...... What did the picture show anyway?  A sex act, NO just someone with their arm around someone else.  This photo does not imply a sexual encounter, what it shows exactly is a ""one time meeting"" of two people who may not have ever seen each other again. This photo does not for me, prove anything other than Andrew may have actually met the plaintiff at an Epstein gathering and nothing more. It would be easy to forget someone at a one time meeting.  Yet, from this one photo depicting nothing other than a one time friendly encounter, two lives and the lives of all their family members are completely and utterly destroyed.    How sad for all the people Epstein and his girlfriend involved in their exploits. Epstein and his girlfriend wasted their lives, but Andrew and these poor manipulated girls have another chance to show the world these events will not define them.  I hope all the girls are all able to find a way to raise above what happened to them, and I hope that Andrew will raise above this speculation and show the world what he is truly capable of being.  So far, what has he accomplished other than this choice to affiliate with a former classmate and Jeffry Epstein which was truly an exercise in bad judgement of a person's character, he has raised two beautiful and productive daughters, been a loving son, and served in the military with honor. Andrew can be redeemed, and he can do better with the rest of his life, ""if"" the world and the ""Firm"" will let him.  If I were a jury member, I could not convict Andrew solely on this one photo, nor his testimony of events.....  BUT what is Andrew really guilty of then?  We may never know the whole truth and nothing but the truth of the matter regarding the Plaintiff, Jeffry Epstein, his girlfriend, and Prince Andrew, but in the court of public opinion for sure Andrew is guilty of very bad judgement and naivety in his loyalty to undeserving friends and/or classmates, a total lack of understanding of empathy for those poor girls, and his burning desire to demonstrate to the Firm he was a mover and a shaker in the business world which led to seeking out truly undesirable classmates and associates. Andrew, I say move on and do not let this define who you are.  This is the past, go forward.  Raise above it, find a purpose to serve your family and country as you have demonstrated you are truly capable of. This could truly be a turning point for the good in your life. You could use your highly visible position to form non-profits to aid and assist young woman and men who are less fortunate than you are. In your book of life,  write on the last pages of your book of life with your good deeds for others.","['It’s not what he said that made he seem guilty but what he doesn’t say.

On the same token why would an alleged victim accept monetary compensation instead of the perpetrator being in prison? The professionalism of the interviewer is outstanding.

"An honest man says little, as the truth speaks for itself. A dishonest man speaks many words to deflect, evade, justify and invent. 

The sheer volume of words a person gives in response to a simple yes or no question is often all you need to spot a lie. Let alone the stammering, feigned looks of shock that linger long enough to drop out of being sincere and become theatrics, the memory lapses, and head nodding and shaking at odds with the verbal response. 

Many examples in this interview, but a classic is, “well we have this photo of you with your arm around Virginia”. Instead of answering, “It’s definitely a Photoshop fake because as I said, I’ve never met her”, he goes into a monologue of deflection such as, “Can’t be me because the photo was taken upstairs and I only stayed downstairs”, “I don’t remember Jeffrey ever having a camera”, “It’s a photo of a photo, so who can tell if it’s real?”, “I couldn’t have been there because in the photo I’m wearing my travelling clothes and I always dress formal when in the UK and in public”. 

People who walk in straight lines don’t need twisted narratives to explain their journey. 

And because he didn’t know the girl, and she wasn’t trafficked to him, and he didn’t dance with her at the club, and he didn’t go back to Maxwell’s home, and he didn’t go upstairs and pose for a trophy photo, and he didn’t have sex with her, he then settled her legal claim by paying her 12 million to go away, because that’s the behaviour of an innocent person?","[""It's definitely me in the photo, but I was never there.\nAlso, how does he know it's upstairs if he's only ever been on the ground floor.\nWhat a buffoon"", 'Not to mention how cagey he became when he was asked about giving a sworn legal statement for his version of events.', '@Musicienne-DAB1995 ...he said he would do be duty bound to do it and then he never did.']",2022-09-26T22:29:36Z,@nicread9508

If I or any of you had done anything remotely close to what he had done, we would be locked up, and rightly so, but because mummy was the Queen, and he was the favourite son he got away with it.

If anything dude, use your experience to coach future royals how NOT to do, what you felt you NEEDED to, to try ""escaping"" from the morality of your own family and the sanctity of what royalty means. Teach the children in your family that they are at the front lines of modern morality, and that it's NOT A PUNISHMENT, but a GIFT! Your Mother used it as a gift, so I have to believe others can too!

If you stand up strong and use your experiences as a message to teach from your mistakes, that's all anyone can really do right? Do that! Please? And please talk to your brother. He wants to slim things down for taxpayer benefits, I get it, but the one thing your Mother's funeral taught us, was that the world is definitely paying full attention, and her example was incredibly gracious and beautiful.

"Wow, death of hrh brought me to this, didn't even know it was covered. Why did he think he would get through it.  Because he is too honourable to lie, because he is self entitled,  because he is totally detatched from what reality is, because he thinks he can outwit this brilliant interviewer and public, I'd say all but the first one! He said he felt he felt that discontinuing his friendship with noncy chops the 2nd over the phone was not appropriate and better done face to face, yes that's because what he had to discuss couldn't be said or recorded. He said that he is a patron of the NSPCC,  yes to source damaged children. He said he stayed with paedo Stein in his house for 4 days because it was convenient, of course it was, then he tried denying that photo, but once confronted about it, said it's a photo of a photo of a photo, so he means a photo! He said that he that the photo was taken upstairs but never been upstairs? How does he know what upstairs looks like,  he said when that photo was taken on March the 10th he was at pizza hut or wherever with his daughters,  well I know that the girl said the photo was taken after a night out at tramps nightclub in London,  pizza Express would have been closed up so his alibi is shot down there, funny this IS the only thing he can remember, he said that at that time because he was shot at he couldn't sweat and hasn't been able to since till now, yeah bet he's sweating during it. Sexstein was having sex with at LEAST 3 girls a day so during his 4 day stay he cant remember seeing any in his house, because not wanting to sound grand at the palace theres lots of people coming and going so he thought THEY were staff, what 13 year old girls?He said hes never had sex with children because, as a man that you have to be quite positive to have sex(his words) but squirms then eye blocks not for the first or last time during the interview(means hes very uncomfortable with this line of questioning) then says he asked himself this and cant remember that he did, classic denial syndrome. When she said for the first time JE is dead how do you feel....shock..then she says it again and he laughs...relief!(JE is silenced). He then says that he was shocked that JE acted so unbecoming...she turns round and says unbecoming,  hes a sex offender, and he says yes I'm just being polite, no you just don't want to utter the words noncy balls. Then he says his way of reconnecting with the public is with education(children) and through raise(children's charity for 7 to 14 yr olds)ultimately admitting hes still at at. It all makes up for a complete royal PR meltdown. I have serious concerns about other people within the house. It's just a coincidence that they were best friends with the UKs worst celebrity serial child SO(Jimmy saville) and now so far(I know there's alot bigger) US biggest child SO!

Prince Andrew was going to trial for illicit sex, but he bought his way out of the lawsuit. The poor boy had to sell the chalet in Switzerland and ask Mum for some dough to pay off the accuser.

"This is precisely why the monarchy must go, to have UNELECTED officials who represent the British image and public (if not officially then unofficially through their unearned privileges, titles and incomes derived from the state) 'pick and choose' their morals while amongst American billionaires is nothing but a disgrace and travesty to the British public.

Even if you personally support the royals, atleast have the decency and self-awareness to strip them of their unearned LEGAL authority, keep them as private citizens and then fall over yourselves worshipping them, but as long as they hold legal power through their privileges and diplomatic immunity (to the point where police can't even enter Prince Andrew's castle to arrest him and book him through the normal legal process we humans in the West are used to) then they will NEVER face any consequences, even tentatively.

This is a disgrace to Britain, no matter how you try to argue how this 70-year old sniveling boy doesn't represent your country, in the eyes of the law he is not only better than you, but entitled to a lifelong pension funded by the British citizens and taxpayers. In fact- why am I saying citizen? Citizens belong to democracies, you are a SUBJECT; not a citizen.

"I thought there were a few problems with the approach of the interviewer, such as repeating things fairly often, and not bringing attention to enough flaws in Andrew's own reasoning, instead moving on, without challenging what he was saying. An example I remember is that she didn't ask why he went to Epstein's mansion in New York, when he already had accommodation, as he had said earlier that he had only visited for convenience, and for lodging. In that case, he already had some. Why did he visit? The interviewer didn't ask.

More importantly, what I want to say is that Andrew was fairly consistent in implying that he found it perfectly fine to be friends with a sex offender and paedophile, so long as it was not publicised, and so long as he was not convicted of it.
His stated reasoning for abandoning the relationship was that it was publicised, and that, since he was a member of the royal family, he should not be associating with Epstein. This implies that he does not think that being friends with a sex offender is inherently a bad thing.
Andrew Windsor is morally bankrupt, and does not deserve his titles, his position, or his high status in society (the rest of family doesn't, either, but, even if the institution of the royal family was assumed to be justified, he doesn't deserve it). In my opinion, he is truly a terrible man.","['There was a lot of ground to cover in a limited amount of time.

"Watching this many times with the benefit of an analytical legally trained mind and endless experience of the phenomenon of the 'rabbit in the headlights' I find that while the Prince is frequently awkward with his responses, rambles and  produces some rather strange explanations such as the subject of 'sweating' and the 'Pizza Hut' in Woking scenario, there is nothing that the interviewer has to effectively challenge what he says. Her technique is very good but the evidence to prove the Prince is lying or attempting to disguise the truth simply isn't there !, Even though he appears to invite the killer question, fact, or indisputable evidence several times, the coup de grāce never comes. What we actually have here is a tawdry collection of unsubstantiated quotes, gutter press rumour mongering and public hysteria plus the assertions,claims and counter claims of two individuals of dubious character. What we don't have is.... Pure, indisputable, reliable, hard evidence. Any Junior Barrister would laugh themselves to death on being asked to consider this third rate Fish and Chip wrapping as a viable prosecution prospect!!. What Prince Andrew is undeniably guilty of is making very poor decisions,- friendship with Maxwell & Epstein, giving the interview and making the enormous donation to the alleged victim 's .... 'Charity' !. One presumes that he had expert advice on the matter? , But, if he did?, Then clearly they were every bit as foolish and inept as the Prince himself!.","[""I think you'll find that being an apologist for elite sexual predators is a fairly unpopular stance to take."", ""@diwlelomo well I'm sure you're quite right.

"The reason Prince Andrew got sucked into the whole Epstein pedophile psychopath thing is Jeffrey Epstein thought if he had all these high profile people he could take down with him they would certainly do whatever it took to make the charges go away!
Epstein was devious and cunning and he used people to shield himself and nothing more. He wasn't anyone's friend but his own, not even that crazy woman who is taking the fall for everything now because somebody choked him out in jail.
Do you think NY Mayor or police commissioner is going to own that?? Never! There was to many coincidences and I don't believe in coincidence! All it takes is a little common sense to see what's going on there.
He made sure he had his photo taken with every celebrity he could and even if they were on a commercial flight he had a photo taken to make it look like they were flying the friendly skies of Epstein Lolita! He wanted any association with any high profile people he could get and the ones with questionable backgrounds were the best.

"Conspiracy of Silence is a documentary which was originally listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, and was to be aired on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994.
This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada.
At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.
A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved.","[""That's nuts. Available anywhere?""]",2022-05-18T10:50:41Z,@lw1zfog

"Someone falsely accuses you of a serious crime - what would you do…?

Give up your reputation, your job, a huge amount of money….? Or, would you fight the accusation with everything that you have…?

Common sense tells us that innocent people fight. The guilty do whatever’s necessary to get out of there and slink off into the shadows. 

I don’t know how gullible you’d need to be to be taken in by Andrew’s little clown act above. 

I guarantee you, if someone accused me of that kind of crime, I’d fight them in every court in the land. It’s utterly laughable to even consider giving them money. 

Obviously, I’m not a lawyer, but when he says, “That photo is of upstairs in Ms Maxwell’s home, and I’ve never been upstairs in her home…”. the obvious question would be - how do you know it’s upstairs, if you’ve never been there…? Any 5-year-old with an ounce of common sense could catch him out in his lies. It’s embarrassing.","[""You fail to understand what a civil trial is.   A civil trial requires nowhere near a level of evidence of a criminal trial required for a guilty verdict, in fact it requires none.   No matter how innocent your are, it is trial by personality in the glare of the World's media circus.\n\nYou would have an emotional tearful woman who was trafficked by Epstein, a known ped0.  Her claim would be that she was sexually assaulted, but she will have NO evidence of that allegation.   The accused is a privileged buffoon who was a friend of said trafficker.  He can not prove it did not happen, because that is impossible.\n\nEven if innocent, what do you think the result of that civil trial would be?"", 'I fully understand the differences between ‘civil’ and ‘criminal’ proceedings. Let me summarise for you - criminal proceedings require the prosecution to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’. Civil proceedings are driven by the ‘balance of probability’ - for example, is it more likely than not. \nAnd yes, levels of proof are STILL required. \nThe ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ test is difficult because -\n1. It’s a ‘he says, she says’ case. \n2. Maxwell is saying nothing at the moment, but may well change her mind in future. \n3. Andrew has taken on the defence of the new ‘no comment’ - ‘I don’t remember’ - the last refuge of the ‘guilty’. \nAndrew now finds himself in Jimmy Savile territory - ‘getting away with it’. There’s no way he was getting into a witness box. Not even his expensively-assembled legal team would have been able to protect him. And, he knows it.', ""@tinamac2380 \nAt least you've now Google'd the difference, well done.\n\nThere is no point going to trial and have your private life exposed to the media circus.  You know that it will be trial by media, you WILL lose because it is based on personalities.  The common sense direction is to settle regardless of innocence or guilt.\n\nQuite why you are unable to grasp this simple point is a mystery."", 'Random Task -\n\nOh dear. Lashing out with insults. \n\nNo. I don’t need to ‘google’ the difference between ‘criminal’ and ‘civil’. I’m not a lawyer, but my profession takes me into court on a regular basis.

"Why didn’t she broach the subject of Epstein’s reasons for the plaignant’s employment in his set-up?  She was employed by him ie on his staff role as precisely what? As an entertainer, hostess or what?  How really innocent was she or was she really and truly so gullible? And if so what of her parents’ absence of any responsibility?  How many months in total had she « known » Epstein and/or Maxwell in relation to her being in paid employment of either of them?  As a young girl innocent of the wider world and all its lack of scruples how come she was « swept along «  with so much ease without her having any inner thoughts and dreams of any kind of sex relationship within the period of difference between her coming of legal age of consentment?  If she was an « unwilling virgin » and conscience of herself being so then also unconvincing she believed she wouldn’t be bonked sooner or later in that atmosphere, or was her ploy of girlish naivety the best to pursue with all the risks to hold on to the not ungenerous gains and life-style?  To take a hypothetical example as to law ethics…how really guilty and damnable would a smart arse  character be who encourages a far less partner in their joint crimininal ventures to kill a policeman in their way threatening their freedom, knowing that if caught he would escape guilt because he still a minor but his partner would take the full consequences of the law because older by a few months and not legally a minor… such a case happened in England and capital punishment took place fo the elder and arguably the more dim-witted of the pair ie he did the foul deed and ought to have known better, but the other one escaped execution because of a few months his junior.   Whither the fairness of Justice?  Maybe the Law should say something about her ways of earning her living?  What exactly is her profession and where did she learn it?

"I personally think he is guilty by association as he is a spoilt chap. One rich upper echelon bloke followed another one. For most of us I should imagine in England it isn't the fact he may of slept with a 17 year old as that is legal here. When  I was 17 in 1990 we had lots of older men come on to us. My 16 year old daughter tells me often of the car horns etc that go off when she is walking home from work etc. For us  It's the fact that a member of the royal family was so stupid to liaise with a man who most people knew at the time was trafficking young women and probably boys to an island and then denies it. It's about protecting each other and protecting our youth from the trafficking industry. When people say oh well she was 17 so legal. That's not the issue. It's that these girls who came from poor and disruptive family backgrounds were touted purposely to act as sexual slaves to these mega rich men and women where they thought they would feel special, loved and cherished. They were exploited because of their background. Millions still are being exploited, sadly far younger. A man or woman of experience earning money from those who suffer in this way is gross.

People spend time around sexual abusers every single day. They don’t know what they are. The victim may believe that to be true. But doesn’t mean it is.

"This is the continuous gov and fbi misuse of power in US. They did this to Bill Cosby, murdering /removing his Son 1st. Here they say murdered / removed Princess Diana was taken to Bolivia and hidden and for espionage use, and tearing down the crown of England. They did this smear campaign also to Weinstein, they did this to Michael Jackson, they did this to Jeffrey Epstein, they did this to George Michael by LA POOLICE. They took over their estates, their properties, their money and their families for further gov destruction and call these groups MONEY PIGS they steal all existence from. They have me and my entire family as money pigs to the US GOV POOLICE AND STARS IN US AND I AM TELLING THE TRUTH WITHOUT ""CONTAINMENT,"" A MOVIE THEY MADE ABOUT THEIR US EVILS. They do this for money, to overtake, to infiltrate, to occupy the entire lives of families they seek to alienate and make family members afraid or ashamed to associate with their own family so they can isolate us and terrorize the life out of you alone, and essentially misuse power and tortures together to torture people to death and steal our family wealth. Here the gov followers call trump as minister in scientology sadist cult, JESUS. The imbalance of trump the idiot thinking he is JESUS shows the US depravity for greed over every living and past living leader or powers of the World. It's bragged that trump went after Kim Jung Un and his wife on his presidential visit with Sentient Knowledge mind reading elon musk spacex technology that I personally named WITH (WIFI in the head). They have bragged about force thinking western culture habits onto Mr. Un's Wife. THOSE PICTURES ARE 30 YEARS AGO, these lies are built for money, for invading families in US FOR DECADES  and other nations to destroy family. Here in US they use WITH (WIFI in the head) military equipment technology for implanting thought that is actual low minded criminally insane poolice, fbi, even prison guards and military to speak into a network system of domestic espionage against family & force speak crazy as what they think which is tawdry and uncommon nastiness to everyone. If its on The Queen Of England she would receive unnatural thought process of start to think of Phillip by normal thought, but the espionage military sentient knowledge WITH program sends many peoples voices that will say over and over a negative command against Prince Phillip. We don't think in repeat fast fire orders of actions we tell ourselves to do. These used and turned very evil US gov employees are mentally unstable neurotic lunatics who are also psychologically neurotic in speech to overthink our own thoughts on insistent repeat fire thought that is maladjusted to say the least. If The Queen Of England thought there was a need to strip Monarchy Powers from her family, she would think it once or think maybe its required, but she would not think it 5 times in a row as a command to her by US interference in The Queen's Business and The Queen's Family. This explanation is offered as a WARNING to foreign sovereigns to know if you are being modern day militarily overtook by US TECHNOLOGICAL ESPIONAGE INVASION. I am a US Whistleblower on the fraud, espionage, and technology criminal products, including 5G for physical pain torture, by the US being used for World Destruction of Peace and Harmony among Nations and Family. The rich in US are so impoverished in morals or merit, and their greed of ownership and power over others is so far advanced for decades by Antichrist Obama Terrorist Act rules for American Terrorism of old dead scroll style Muslim dictates for deprivation and human punishment that is also tied to the rich and famous funded scientology sadist cult with fbi dictates, so none are safe, even US CITIZENS, from US TERRORISM as the cruelest and most genocidal terrorism on Earth ever before. I and my entire family are decades long victims of these evils. My Father Robert S. TYLER the 1st, Wrote for the BBC DECADES BACK, and my name D'Evelyn came from one of his stories he submitted to BBC for consideration. I worry that Prince Phillip has some of the US tortures on him as those eyebags are typically injected fluids they put on many here in the US by force and gov ghb misuse to destroy good looks and personal confidence of good health and insert the microwave wire for 5G 364ghz currents microwave pain and shock tortures to eyes and face. I know this interview played while I typed, but the sound was off. It is very torturous to me to watch US getting away with these evils as they put our own Brother into prison innocent 25years ago saying for a murder cutting up his fiance with no body, no real dna, using a piece of steak as a knee, and santa clara county coroner said no proof of death until 9 years later missing that long, but poolice gov madeup this evil scenario of ritual murder of their own vile contemptible thoughts of evil and convicted a good innocent man with no proof and false evidence in crooked US Court System for money payoffs and property overtakes thefts. The missing fiance, Imelda Pascua - Phillipine descent, never looked for has been said to have also been put into prison to hide her still being alive. Do Not Submit your Country's Authority to Evil American Rich Foes To Humanity. As I seek to write books of 40years in this evil plots for US controlling ownerhip over innocent lives by presidential misuse of antichrist obama terrorist act rules for human and animal destructions takeover GOV BETRAYERS and WITH BIDEN and BIDEN - THE DIRTY DEAL books are halted intervened by hacking and theft of my $5000 Quosmio laptop by gov, and now my hacked new HP $900 laptop by them rewritten my BIOS in front of my eyes with no internet in the house, but plugged into the electrical outlet AND changing my illegally gates forced WINDOWS PIN to even access my ownership.

"Prince Andrew, 

War hero: Falklands active duty.
Playboy lifestyle and very blind to the real world.
Alleged to have had relations with a 17 year old. Depending on where this took place legality varies “if we go by the standard law of the land” ie you follow the laws of the country you are in. 
So far no evidence has emerged of any other girls/women being involved in inappropriate sexual abuse/assault/rape.
So far only the one woman has come forward and I’m hesitant to throw him under the bus.
If there is evidence he went to the island he should be hung drawn and quartered.
However this interview was a disaster, but then we don’t move in their circles, like it or not these people are involved in complex business deals and global programs that we are not privy too. By birth right, default or because they’re elected by us the people.

The problems we face globally are because we think that the way forward is big government when in fact more localised government and management of resources and assets would be far more beneficial to us the people.

Of course I buy his interview, I think he is just a bumbling rich higher class fool who was easily manipulated into taking invites and wanting to be part of what they now call themselves the global elite, imagine being the “spare” and seeing yourself and family becoming more and more irrelevant especially when you’ve been looked upon as almost the social status to look to achieve to find yourselves becoming more and more irrelevant. Trying to elevate your status and building relationships in their world is their way of building relevance and remaining in the public eye. Imagine he would have been possibly the poorest and least important person at the dinner party, but he was a link to the royal family. That’s the only reason that he was even brought into their cabal.

We need to stop targeting him as an individual and realise that this is a bigger problem that needs us to wake up, over throw our current way of doing things and establish a way for us the people who these elites have so much control and power over
Have a look at what Russel brand has to say

"I believe he had relations with that girl and other girls at Epstein's, as a royal prince soaring his oaths enjoying the attention from those star struck girls, NOT as a rapist or sex trafficker. I really don't think he slept with those girls knowing that they were trafficked or with the intention to sexually assault them. 

I do think Epstein&Co realised andrew was a gullible royal from the world's most famous royals, yearning for fame, and to have him in their circles would up their ""street cred"", so they took full advantage of his gullible grewup-in-a-royal-bubble-all-my-life self. They could tell he had no experience about being in the ""real"" world with ""real"" people, outside of that royal bubble . He was being used, a victim of his own privileged position and spoilt upbringing, had fun while it lasted now the chickens are coming home to roost. Where were his royal ""nannies"" why didn't they shield him from such exploitation, or were they equally just as gullible too. 

One's past indiscretions always has a way of catching up with one. IMHO his only crime was guilty by association, immorality and promiscuity, not sex trafficking or sexual assault. His nervousness and callousness during this interview reveals just what a gullible easy target for exploitation he is. If this interview was a courtroom, he'd be found guilty as hell and jailed.

"There's a definite nuance of some old British comedy/comedians creeping through this ""interview,"" perhaps Rowan Atkinson and Pamela Stephenson Connolly out of ""Not the Nine 'o clock News"". The absolute vacuum of self awareness Andrew carries around in place of honesty and earnestness... the hubris already mentioned. He's like a self proclaimed vegan guru of thirty years sitting down to chat about how He's discovered game meat and poultry from the country doesn't count as meat owing to it's country freshness and the manner in which it's slaughtered, and in any case he's been eating country killed meat for decades now, dear, with no ill effects, so he's here to advise everyone of the suitability of such protein. After all, if it wasn't for his noble but  naive  inability to lie about such important issues no-one would now be benefiting from it.

"My favorite part of the interview, and the most telling in my opinion, is when they're talking about his sweating. He says he had a medical condition that prevented him from sweating, caused by having too much adrenaline when he was shot at during war. Here he's trying to gain the respect and sympathy of the viewer by talking about his military experience. He says ""....I don't sweat, or I didn't sweat at the time"", then he pauses, seems to think about what he was saying, as if to make sure he's saying the right thing, mumbles something, then continues ""yes, I didn't sweat at the time"". He's trying to be sure he's making the correct claim, that he didn't sweat.  Anhidrosis is a very serious medical condition. If you're unable to sweat, you can die of overheating and heat stroke. So this is very much a medical condition that has to be monitored and treated. This would be easily provable by his medical provider. His attempt to disprove Virginia Giuffre's claim that he sweated profusely during their encounters, has backfired beautifully. He claimed a potentially deadly medical condition that would require medical supervision and treatment, that he's unable to prove, thereby PROVING her account of the situation. He thought he was untouchable because his mommy is the queen. Well look at how the mighty have fallen. Look at all of the situations and scandals the royal family have been a part of, and this is where the queen drew the line. If this interview occurred today, the interviewer would get to leave off the ""his royal highness"" bit!

"We in Britain, the US and Canada are considered to be equal before the law and we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before the courts. Over the past few decades this has been. and continues to be, eroded by the media and just general gossip and distortion of facts.
Personally, I will not participate in this firestorm. The newspapers and the internet are not the courts. If there is a criminal investigation on anyone no matter who then it is up to the courts to determine the guilt or innocence of a person, any person. The same applies to the sentencing of anyone found to be guilty of a charge or charges. Just as in a rape case the habits of the victim are not the issue; the issue is the conduct of the person facing the allegations before the courts.
If we continue to allow these trials by allegations then none of us is safe before the tsunami of gossip, ignorance and the power of the State.",[],2022-01-21T11:26:16Z,@dracorpgroup

"This spoilt brat will walk away from this.  ""An engaging person"". That’s bloody hilarious.  This is a man who screams at staff, is demanding, nasty, and spoilt to the bone.


I’m a UK citizen that lived in NY for 15 years.  I know how USA justice works.  This clown would not be able to dodge summons servers by hiding in his Mother’s homes.  

If he was Mr Andrew Windsor and worked in a bank or at Micky D’s he’d be on Rikers Island right now.  Especially if he was an African American.  Police brutality is a dose of what this petulant liar needs.  

He claims he stated with Epstein because it was ""convenient""?  When you have around 1000 fabulously wealthy New Yorkers plus the best hotels in Manhattan to stay in why go to a children’s brothel?

He states he was being honourable "" That’s the funniest thing I’ve ever heard”. Oh for people who don’t know what this Royal Family is like, if someone breaks the rules or  is indiscreet they freeze them out for life.

The Queen has acted so well in this situation,  I have to give her credit.  

I’m not a royalist never have been.  Ultimately he will walk away from this.  The Queen bless her will pay a huge settlement and he’ll walk.  If it was an ordinary man in the street it would become a criminal case and Andrew would be facing jail.  Probably the best thing for him.  He’s basically doing a Michael Jackson here.  He’s a pervert.

His ex wife clings to him as her title is the only thing that guarantees her a regular income.  They are a well matched pair.  Greedy, selfish. Self gratifying and spoilt.

This interview the whole body language is one of a liar.  Very similar to when Prince Charles was asked about infidelity with Parker Bowles.  He looked shifty, eye contact was all over the place blatant lies.

This pervert could have severed all connections but kept going there again and again yet this dim witted pudding can’t see he’s done anything wrong!!  Please put him behind bars!  In America.

I don’t know where the bar is at Tramp lol.  What a liar.  He drinks.  

If someone asked me where I was 2 weeks ago I couldn’t tell you.  He remembers Woking said it’s unusual went to pizza express!  Ok well they have private chefs (all of them do) plus why would he drive to pizza express when he has detectives chauffeurs and other minions to do this for him.  This whole interview is a tissue if lies.

He needs to be held accountable.  He doesn’t remember the photo??  Oh please!  Now it’s not his hand now it’s the position it’s just pathetic  Hes posing and smiling saying it’s someone else’s  hand!    

Put this idiot behind bars PLEASEEE!

"Lady Colin Campbell is absolutely positive that Prince Andrew did NOT have sex with Giuffre. She claims the case against Prince Andrew is a DEMOCRAT CONSPIRACY. 
 She says the judge is CORRUPT. The lawyers are CORRUPT. The US JUDICIARY system is CORRUPT. President Clinton is CORRUPT. Hillary is CORRUPT. Ex NY governor Cuomo is CORRUPT.  Even Andrew's  lawyers may be setting him up, but she 's not sure about that. In other words the whole world is against poor, innocent, Prince Andrew and he won't get a fair trial simply because he is a royal.

Of course we all know there is corruption in the court system but poor Lady C seems to see enemies crawling out of the woodwork just to bring down ""Randy Andy"". Her recent video's only have a nodding acquaintance with the  truth and FACTS are not what interest her.

Is Prince Andrew guilty or innocent ?  I prefer to wait, to see what happens before I shoot my mouth off !

Incredible to see how “categorically” the man looses his voice when asked if he would testify against Epstein.. man is clearly lying 🤥. Nothing new in our world the rich and powerful get their way no matter what and just brush it under the rug. I also don’t believe Epstein committed suicide judging by the autopsy report it is highly extremely rare to have a piece of muscle that sits underneath the chin area to break in a fragmented manner by a bed sheet tied around the neck. This was a highly classified undercover murder that was staged to appear as suicide because imagine the filth that is about to come busting out of all the bad deeds of the rich and famous! Sick just absolutely sick. If he is guilty and of taking part in Epsteins freak show the Creator will catch up with these people. There is huge movement planetary wise that is causing upheaval in all parts of the world where authority that has gone on and abused their powers for the bad are about to get a serving of Karma.

But I often think how this picture was made. I'm not saying that is not real but still strange to me. Prince Andrew welcome them in his flat.
I don't think he asked about this girl age or ID. Maybe he assumed she is over 18. Secondly if he care about his reputation, would he really be so recless to go with them upstairs? What for? And then make picture with this girl. It's suspicious to me. 
Maxwell staying apart almost like this picture was supposed to be taken only prince and the girl. 
Maybe girl asked for a picture as a memory and Maxwell who seems very manipulative arrange all situation almost like she wanted to have something on him in the future.
I don't think Andrew was thinking about making himself a pic. With a girl. It was rather the girl who wanted that picture or Maxwell who wanted to blackmail him. 
Now another thought, why he would let himself in such a position?   The fact that he let make a picture of himself with underage girl point rather to .... that it was a normal situation. Girl wanted picture with the prince, because I don't believe prince wanted picture with the girl.

"Emily Maitlis: How could you not recognize that the ten angers girls in his friend Jeffrey Epstains house was in fact, sex slaves?
Andrew explains that he in his whole life been surrounded by maids. For the Prince this reasoning is absolutely logic.
There is simple as that a difference between someone like himself , who have the same status as he has, and those who is there for serve you.

Andrew met E in the beginning of the -90s. They have been on a lot of dinners, parry’s and charity events together . 

The Prince had both Epstein and his friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now convict for sex crime against children, as guests at his mothers castle in Norfolk.

They partying with Donald Trump in Florida and traveling on vacation to Thailand where they was photographed in the sunlights with naked women breasts. 

Jeffrey Epstein was even guest to Andrews daughter at her 18-birthday on Windsor castle. 

After Jeffrey Epstein was convicted for sex crime, his friends hurried to take distance to him. 
Prince Andrew instead traveled over to USA for visit his friend. There was photos from December 2010 where Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew walked together in New York, that eventually led to that the Prince Andrew no longer could be in his role as a British 
Handles ambassador.

In April 2015 the Prince name showed up in legals document’s in Florida related to Jeffrey Epstein.

A women with the name Virginia Giuffre claimed that that the Prince had sex with her when she was 17 years old: rapes that she states that was organized by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

Buckingham Palace denied every accusation.

2019 Jeffrey Epstein was arrested again suspected for crime.

He was found dead in his cell in August the same year and the Media fuss did that Prince Andrew decided to talk it out in media.

It’s resulted interview with BBC has been written into the British TV-history.

The Prince say that the photographs that circled around with his arm around a 17 years old Virginia Giuffre had to be fake. He say that she had to be lien because she said that he was sweaty a lot and the Prince can’t sweat, it was some kind of damage he got under the Falkands war, he claimed.

But above all the Prince didn’t express any empathy to Jeffrey Epstains victims. Not even when the journalist Emily Maitles asked him if there was anymore he wanted to adding. Instead, the Prince said that he didn’t regret his friendship with Epstain- a man that lured in underage girls to powerful mans sexual pleasure for fun. 

The Interview with BBC forced the Prince to leave the Royalty scene. 

2021 Virginia Giuffre sued the Prince in a civil case in New York. In 22 January It was clear that the American court will not drop the legal process. 
The Prince can now been put right in USA for sexual abuse. 
The answer from Buckingham palace came immediately. The Prince looses his royalty titles, he is from now on a civilian citizen and as so he will defense himself.

He also looses all his military titles. Captain Tobias Ellwood , the President in the British parliament for defense Committee welcomed the decision. 

It was “necessary for the British military reputation” he said.
The war Prince is now alone. 

And still claims that he has never met Virginia Giuffre.",[],2022-01-16T22:06:22Z,@mareliza2734

"Funny how he says he never went upstairs in that house where the photo was taken but he recognises it's upstairs. How does he know it was upstairs if he doesn't know what upstairs looks like.
Also if he says that is him in the photo how come he can't explain what maxwell was doing there or the others.in saying it is him he also cannot deny maxwell or others were there .and in saying that he has few photos taken therefore he should remember better which photos he had taken. It doesn't make sense that he couldn't remember one out of a few yet many remember everything single photo they have had if even if there are many . also he has never accounted for the girls he was seen waving to from the door of epsteins mansion in new York especially as he claimed not to have met any of them or know them.

Was he the FIRST MAN to sleep with the underaged  employee of Epstein??? 
Are British men so chaste and loyal that they do not get involved with any woman after marriage?? 
Was Prince Andrew forced into a realationship with this woman as a Party guest of Epstein??? 
Was he lured into this ""one night stand "" after being drunk or drugged as a party guest??? 
If Andrew was in weak mind, and trusting his friends party to be Fun and a escape :
 is he wrong to befriend any female guest relations officers at his friends party ??? 
Many many woman look younger than their age  these days and behave same No one dresses for their age either. Are men suppose to ask her indentification card so as to know her age before having a conversation 
 Would  any men ask  her if she has men friends  does she sleep with other men at a party so as not to violate British laws  of men and woman relationship for one night stands??? 
Yes ,Some parties found evidence, Prince Andrew had spent time with a girl who worked for Epstein  but thats at a resort party  ,should he be  cruxified  for not knowing she was underaged  ???
He trusted Epstein and his employees and friends 

Yes! Epstein must be the only person who should be charged in court for 
1.Luring young girls into illegal business activities
2,For owning a resort which was a Brothel 
3 For kidnapping Girls 
4, For Criminal Breach of Trust, and purposely forcing underaged girls to party with unsuspecting guest
5*Most guest may have unsuspectingly accepted an invitation to a weekend  Business discussion on his private island holiday resort 
6* Unsuspecting friends may have been forcefully connered into a no escape situation with Wine woman and Song  for his own Business needs and commercial gain 
7* As a party will have photos to BLACKMAIL if the deal does not get approved 
8* If Epstein's modes operandi was Blackmail, employ underaged girls and offer sex, liquor and party to build his business empire 
Why does the Government  of United States choose TO SUE  or file court action on the BUSINESS VICTIMS 
9* At most use their statement as witness statements to confirm that Epstein was running a illegal operation on his Private Resort for his Business 
10*Everyone of his clients or ""FRIENDS"" were used and abused including blackmailed for Business to build his empire 

11* By stripping off Prince Andrews Royal titles and file court action against him for being a victim of Blackmail  is unsound  justice 
12* This will encourage Crooked Businessmen with money to thrive on employing young girls massuers to arouse guest into having sexual escapade with them and then blackmail for business Gain
13*As it is a private holiday resort far away from spies, and public eye, but will be embedded with hidden cameras for Blackmail 
14*Any enemy of a Businessmen, Royalty and High Government officials can get trapped and forced by this sort of BLACKMAIL BUSINESSMEN into dangerous situations 

14*The world is a paradise for such  illegal businessman who are not afraid of any law as BLACKMAIL is their weapon , sex  ,drugs and alcohol is their ammunition 

15*They are so powerful and well  placed in social circles , they have well guarded secrets of most of their network of  Victimised friends , most of whom are rich , famous and titled 

16*As for the workers in Epsteins resort they are COMMERCIAL  in their ventures as they were used by  many. 
No fault of theirs but
Suing their ""BED PARTNERS""
should not be allowed as they should sue their employers and staff who abused and illtreated them or forced them into sex jobs 
17* The Client or bed partner in a private resort has to be lured and tempted by her services to have sex with her underaged or overaged
18* She could have had sex with many guest in her two years of employment 
The Government has to look into the sex trade laws which may be as ancient as British History 
19*There has to be a law that protects young girls from being lured into the sex trade .The employer has to be charged and clients caught red handed entering Brothels who patronise such places should be charged 
21* However Victims of Social Blackmail should not be charged but their statements can be used as used as 1st party evidence 
22*Victims must never be charged, as they were tricked, cheated and made use of by the businessman for his own Business needs and the fear of BLACKMAIL  may cause the Victim to comply to all his demands l

"For some reason so come to think about Bob Dylan’s Master of war.

Maybe because raping underage girls is like war.

I could say, come you Masters of abuse
You hide behind your royality, but the Queen took it all off, where you hide behind your mask 
I can see through your eyes
I can see through your brain
And your lies 
You might say I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned 
But let me tell you one thing
Not even Jesus would forgive you for what you did 
Let me ask you this question 
Is the money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness 
Will it save your soul 


“""Masters Of War""

Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead”

Why would you link yourself to a victim compensation settlement if it’s got nothing to do with you?  Trust me, Epstein didn’t pay anyone money. He got that money from his clients (the Johns).

knocked off his bike by a speeding American motorist coming out of a USA military
place, of some kind? This killing by dangerous driving and driving away, all witnessed.
No matter what the parents did to get the driver back to the UK, it was stopped by the big people in the USA, claiming Diplomatic immunity. The absolute evidence of the killing and
driving away, to me is either Manslaughter or maybe Worse. These parents need to get
this driver back here, to stand trial, on both charges. Ask this American Judge about this

People in places of power using ALL of their manufactured confusion to distract us as a nation, which allows them to continue their corruption unabated.

Until we understand that we need to focus our energy into reigning in these powerful criminals together, as a nation united, instead of squabbling amongst ourselves, these power-crimes will continue to grow in ferocity and metastasize, completely eroding what’s left of our already terminally ill  society.",[],2022-01-14T08:46:21Z,@joshgriffin4258

"We all know Ghislaine Maxwell as a bit of a wild child if you followed the news from the UK. She was her father's favorite and he was extremely rich and controversial. Prince Andrew was a mummie's boy and the Queen's favorite but this didn't stop him to have an affaire with Koo Stark, a pornstar and there was no love lost between Fergie and the Royals. So both were frequently mentioned in the tabloids and the BBC news. So nothing new there. But I do believe she was so in love with that Epstein character. So much so, she would have done anything to not get dumped by him. It's also no secret he gas- lighted her early into their relationship. That whole family is all about secrets and saving face. As are the Royals. I think the three of them just used eachother to their own benefit and closed their eyes to the more sordid details that were not known to the public. Is Prince Andrew a pedophile? I don't think so but did he like having young girls around to have sexual relationships with without other strings attached? While he was introduced to the rich and famous. Sure 100%...mixing business whith pleasure is right up his alley.

"Emily Maitlis: Do you remember meeting [the 17-year-old Virginia Roberts] at all?

Prince Andrew: No.

Emily Maitlis: Do you know you didn't meet her, or do you just not remember?

Prince Andrew: No, I have, I don't know if I've met her. But no, I have no recollection of meeting her.

Emily Maitlis: Because she was very specific. She described the dance that you had together in Tramp's, she described meeting you, she was a 17-year-old girl meeting a senior member of the royal family.

Prince Andrew: Never happened.

Emily Maitlis: She provided a photo of the two of you together.

Prince Andrew: Yes.

Emily Maitlis: Your arm was around her waist.

Prince Andrew: Yes.

Emily Maitlis: You've seen the photo.

Prince Andrew: I've seen the photograph, yes,

Emily Maitlis: How do you explain that?

Prince Andrew: I can't, but I don't, I mean again, I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken.

Emily Maitlis: Do you recognize yourself in the photo?

Prince Andrew: Oh, yeah, it's pretty difficult not to recognize yourself.

Emily Maitlis: Your friends suggested that the photo is fake.

Prince Andrew: I think it's, from the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not, because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph, so it's very difficult to be able to prove it. But I don't remember that photograph ever being taken.

Emily Maitlis: But it's possible that it was you with your arm around her waist?

Prince Andrew: That's me, but whether that's my hand or whether that's the position, I...[shakes head]...I have simply no recollection of a photograph ever being taken.

Emily Maitlis: The world has now seen the photo that Virginia Roberts provided, taken by Epstein we understand, in Ghislaine Maxwell's house.

Prince Andrew: Here's the problem: I've never seen Epstein with a camera in my life.

Emily Maitlis: I think it was Virginia Roberts' camera. She said a little Kodak one that she lent to Epstein who took a photo, and your arm is round her waist.

Prince Andrew: I don't remember that photograph ever being taken. I don't remember going upstairs in the house, because that photograph was taken upstairs.

"...I think an innocent person would reply ""no"" to these accusations instead of ""I don't think so"" when it comes to having sex with underage girls, but that's just me. Also, it is one thing to be with Epstein when he didn't know about his sex trafficking (I doubt he never knew about it) but it is quite another to go back and see him afterwards, especially if you think sex trafficking is wrong. It is not cowardly to phone call them and say 
""hey you're accused/convicted of something illegal (and disgusting), I don't think we should be friends"" since afterall, he ""wasn't best friends with him"" anyways. You'd also think, if he was innocent, he would show compassion for the women that were trafficked. Even if these women were making it up (which I find hard to believe, but the law states you are innocent until proven guilty...but that photo though, damn he shouldn't be able to wiggle out of this one, but he has money/power so who knows) your reaction and demeanor should be not on edge, as well as not making long winded answers to Emily's questions...if you're accused of something that 100% didn't happen, your answer should be ""no"" because it simply didn't happen.",[],2022-01-12T04:23:30Z,@laurenmelissa6988

"Dear Prince Andrew, please be a role model and give justice to the case. Return the dignity and life to those young girls and face and accept the responsibility for your actions. Do not pass on the wrong and the pain that was done to you. It takes real strength and honour to be open about one's faults, even more so in a position of constant public attention and scrutiny, but in the end, we are all humans, we all have our shortcomings and there are many men out there with a weakness for the charms of youth and power (not saying you should follow up on it, but it is out there, it should not be shushed and hidden away, but acknowledged as one of life's challenges so we as humans can find a new way of dealing with it). Show the world and your own children that you are man and father enough to stand up for your share of the crime. I would have deep respect for you. Please help for the other men involved to come clean, too (as clearly there must be more than just two perpetrators in this case). Help the world become a better place.

I am a huge fan and follower and supporter od the British Royal Family and  your mother Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth Ii. Both your lovely daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie has just made you and the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson grandparents and the Queen a great grandmother again.  Your Royal Highness you just lost your father His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip just recently and just had your father's funeral plus this tell all Oprah Winfrey interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and on top of that the Royal Family having to deal with a fallout with Harry and Meghan and a new investigation into the late Diana Princess of Wales's BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir.  And on top of everything else after the death of Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh. And now this lawsuit against His Royal Highness the Duke of York Prince Andrew.  The Duke of York is innocent.  This Virginia Gaffire is a liar and Jeffrey Epstein's  500K payoff to Virginia Gaffire to lie and keep the truth quiet is so wrong. The truth will come out in the end it always does and Prince Andrew will be proved innocent and Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Gaffire will get done for sending an innocent man a member of the British Royal Family the Queen and Prince Philip's son down for something he didn't do. What Epstein and Gaffire are doing to the Duke of York is so wrong.

"When I first saw this interview I got caught up with all the mass media / social media hype that he was evasive, improbable and basically self incriminating.  I’m not a great fan of Andrew, but looking at it now with unbiased eyes, I actually believe him. If you look at his responses compared with those you would expect from most people, he does seem to circumspect, hesitant and less than emphatic with his answers, and offers his explanations in a way that would make his lawyer cringe. But when you consider his background it starts to make more sense; he comes from a background which instils a code of honour, and etiquette that is alien to most of us, and I think the impression of reticence and restraint are more indicative of how he communicates in general, ie being careful to choose the right words and maintain a high level of civility to all. His biggest mistake was to go and visit Epstein in person after his conviction, and stay at his house; Andrew is not a complete idiot, if he was he’d never have cut it as a Naval officer, so it’s hard to understand why he felt the need to do that especially if he and Epstein were never close friends anyway, and on,y saw each other a couple of times a year. It’s  not a smoking gun, and could be construed as an exaggerated sense of propriety although at worst it could also have been a mission of damage limitation (the sort of conversation you’d want to have in person outdoors in the park with nobody listening in.) That is the only real red flag I can see, but even that could have been to keep a lid on something more minor that might be used to expose him to false accusations.  A man of his high profile would have to be a complete idiot to take the risk of doing what he is accused of, not once but three times, even if he were so inclined. Not impossible, but highly improbable. When it comes to the actual accusations made against him, there is nothing implausible or disprovable about anything he said; even if the inability to sweat  sounded rather peculiar that doesn’t make it false. On the flip side, there is zero solid evidence to back up the accusations against him, other than a photo of a photo of a photo which could very easily have been edited. Also, if there was any doubt that the accuser might at least be partly motivated by financial gain, the recent revelation of her 500,000 USD out of court settlement with Epstein should at least provide a clue. As I said, I’m not a huge fan of Andrew but on balance I think I believe him on this one.","['I look at the settlement from Epstein as part of that long tradition of the powerful trying to buy off their victims. That along with the fact that two of the three people she has accused have been found guilty in court in my mind makes her a credible witness. If money was her only motivation I think there would be far easier targets in the Epstein circle to go after.', '@obk1404 Exactly.', '@obk1404 Fair point but if she wasn’t motivated by money, why accept the payment from Epstein rather than seek justice against him in court?', '@justinneill5003 I imagine it would have something to do with the fact that she was up against a billionaire with close relationships with some of the most powerful and influential people on the planet. She may also have witnessed some of these powerful people behaving like Epstein did and so would have seen her case as futile and so accept money to try and get her life back together. The psychological damage of being a victim of sexual abuse is well documented. Look how long it took people abused by the clergy to finally come forward and seek justice and in the interim they still attended church and took moral instruction from the very people who had covered up their abuse.']",2022-01-05T12:29:14Z,@justinneill5003

"I relate to him. I too have turned down invitations to parties I knew were illegal, and  been driven by a desire to be so honorable that after arriving to tell them I couldn't come I'd  go above and beyond and stay anextra few nights just to make them feel special while making it clear to them how sincerely I take my conviction to not participate in the festivities.

Prince Andrew is simultaneously a terrible person yet so perfectly incompetent at trying to claim that he isn't one that you could have the greatest scriptwriters and comedy writers in the world write a scene like this, and it would never be as hilarious. Literally every single affirmation he makes has a perfect contradiction to match usually within the same answer, and a master of comedic timing couldn't replicate it.

I genuinely would be fine if they sentenced him to just do interviews for the rest of his life asking questions about the entire Royal Family and whether he remembers every event or party he's been to. And you could show him pictures of all the people he's met throughout his life just asking if he remembers them while mixing in photoshopped pictures of him with people he's never met or never heard of. He's the villain and the hero of his own life's movie.",['🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣'],2022-01-04T10:33:09Z,@MrTkillian

"I’ve never been a fan of PA, simply because he always came across as arrogant….BUT, despite being a womaniser, I do think that Epstein and Maxwell USED PA and his Royal connections to bring others into their sordid circle.

The picture that the media keep showing, shows Virginia Roberts smiling happily with Guislaine also present…VR told PA that she wanted to be photographed with him to show her mother!!! 
If PA had slept with this “of legal age” girl without her consent, why is she happy to be seen with him, and quite happy to be so????
PA was a newly divorced man, and VR was (at each alleged meeting) of LEGAL AGE OF CONSENT, so WHY is she suing him NOW ???

That is sick . Our US government knew this for 30 years and did nothing to save the children .  They are just as guilty also just because they turn their heads and never told any of us .  I remember back when there was a group of senators went to Israel and partied in this party they went skinny dipping where Christ had walked on the water .  One short news cast was made about it and that was cut off . Nothing was ever said about it and nothing was done . It was hushed up .  This will be the same . NO Justice will ever become of this .  HO just one and they hanged Jeffrey Epstein . That was not for justice that was to shut him up , wife up and anyone else . I also know that this high cult these people belong to would take a female child and sacrifice her to death . They rape her first then torment her before she would die . This political cult is here in the USA . This cult goes way back into the beginning of this nation . It is a devil worshiping cult for only top members for the government cabinet and a handful of vary rich people . Some of them are people like the Rockefeller's , Rothchild's ,   Jeffrey Epstein of the day , Clinton's , Both Bushes , and  on and on . These people made their deal with Satin and made their deal with GOD both . They think they have a plan before they die . They will get a high Priest to ask GOD to save them and the priest will  tell them that they are saved . This priest will be of a Catholic religion . Always will be .  It is their faith that can save them . This is because the in the Catholic religion that only a priest can talk to GOD . The most worthy .

"He would ""love"" to be able to answer more pertinent question if he could....  He considers his alleged behavior is not damaging to his mother, the Queen or the institution.  How can he say such a thing when this case, so far, has been the most destructive action to his family in generations? Far worse than  Uncle David and his Nazi Germany visits & abdication in my view.   One wonders what behavior or incident would reflect badly on the elderly Queen ?    To be fair Diana specially after her divorce was not paragon of virtue. By that I mean having a series of affairs with married men, causing at least only marriage to collapse and even making well published harassing phone calls.  Even one Metropolitan Police protection Officer committed suicide under questionable circumstances.   Unlike Andrew because she was appreciated mostly by the media and public there was never any investigation into her clearly  possible criminal conduct.  No surprise there .   Frankly, all this (Margaret, Ferguson, Armstrong-Jones, Mountbatten even Charles and his Dad) leaves one to the conclusion this rather expensive indulged family is"" off the rails "" and on a quick downward spiral.    No wonder they are very ""low profile"" these days with only lot's of photos of Kate playing the piano etc.     As of to day the good no nonsense NY Judge has ruled the civil case must proceed with an ""interesting "" exchange of documents (Discovery in legal speak) and according to the Guardian newspaper to day it is said that the Plaintiff's team has found 6 people who can tie HRH with the Plaintiff  Roberts and he had produced no evidence as to his then problem of not being able to ""perspire.""  My mother told me use of ""sweat"" was common lol
The Guardian are now raising the strong possibility of an out of Court settlement and also the potential difficulty enforcing any Judgment as the Defendant is out of the Jurisdiction and or well placed 'for now) in society.  If I was the Plaintiff's lawyers I would apply to the Court as a condition of the Defendant being allowed to continue his defence that he deposits in cash, say,  for starters $ 4 million. (this would be for any damages and Plaintiff's costs which are huge)    This is a common procedure in English civil litigation and good practice in such ""tricky"" cases.

The results when too many people in a person's life just agree with any garbage they say."", 'Why would it suggest that?', ""@jimmyandersson9938 It's clear, by implication. He suggests sex is particularly memorable for a man, because, mechanically, the man must be in a particular physical state to perform it and be the mechanical giver, not the receiver.\nThe natural consequence is that he's suggesting sex is less memorable - actually, comparatively easy to forget - for a woman than it is for a man, because she is the mechanical receiver. If that isn't what he's suggesting, there'd be no meaning in the distinction he makes  in the first place, so why bother to make it?..\nIt's all to be expected as he's obviously a complete and absolute idiot."", '@lewis7515 Could be, but the way I interpret it is simply he is a man and therefor just focus on the mans perspective, since they are talking about him and his memory. Stating a man likes sex isnt necessary saying women dont.\n\nKeep also in mind he is very nervous, stressed, uncomfortable etc and that makes you ramble alot of nonsense, combined with what you mention, a complete idiot.', '@jimmyandersson9938 No. This is nothing to do with anything? And it wasn\'t a matter of him stating, ""he likes sex"" - have you actually watched the interview? The terms there are very clear and very specific.\n\nHe is asked: ""For the record, is there any way you could have had sex with that young woman [Virginia Giuffre Roberts], or any young woman trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, in any of his residences?"" \n\nHe replies: ""No - and, without putting too fine a point on it: if you’re a man it is a positive act, to have sex with somebody. \nYou have to take some sort of positive action - and so, therefore, if you _try_ to forget, it\'s very difficult to try and forget a positive action? \nAnd I do not remember, anything"".\n\nThis is, obvious, complete garbage and an excercise in talking in circles - and there is only the one interpretation: \nHe is excusing himself of any recall or charge of having sex with somebody, _on the basis that_ it\'s not possible to forget you\'ve had sex, if you\'re a man - because a man, ""has to take positive action to have sex with somebody"": by which he clearly means being a sufficiently physiologically aroused state to commit himself into physically mating with female genitals.\n\nThis is nonsense: whether a man takes, ""positive action"", or not, is not a determinant of whether they remember having sex - nor is it a determinant in their ability to, ""try to forget"", having sex. \nBy example, man who was raped is going to try very hard to forget it but he will have great difficulty - yet he made no, ""positive act""....What Andrew said is immediately meaningless as a basis on which to excuse himself of recall of having had sex.\n\nNothing he said is a satisfactory answer as to whether he had sex - furthermore, it\'s so ridiculous it\'s an insult to intelligence.\nThat\'s Number 1.\n\nNumber 2, is that the inference of his ridiculous comments are that women, are more able to forget having sex, because they do not take, ""positive action"". Again ask anyone who is forced into sex whthere it\'s easy to forget because they made no, ""positive action"". \n\nIt\'s ridiculous. He should go to jail for this, alone - because you know that someone who tells himself this and either believes it, or thinks anyone else is stupid enough to believe it; that person is capable to tell himself any kind of nonsense and may actually convince himself it\'s true.\n\nI\'d think very hard before being tempted to make any excuses for this fool.']",2022-01-01T07:37:18Z,@fudgemcmuffin

I’m English, and I can tell you now that anything the freeloading royal family do is above the law, whatever they or anyone else.  Shame really, I’m not a royalist, and I really think we could do without them all, especially all the ‘hangers on’ but I do admire the Queen and I think it is very sad for her that her son (who we are told is her favourite) is such a scum bag.  But equally, he doesn’t work now, not that I think he ever did, like most of the royals, (kept by the English taxpayers) but we are told that the Queen is keeping him now.  I do understand that he is her son and she loves him, but may I say respectfully your majesty, a big mistake.  She is now 95, having served this country for 79 plus years impeccably, what a shame this has happened to her now.  She has never shown her feelings in public, and good on her, but honestly, if Andrew was my son, I would despair.  Anyway, god bless the queen and really sorry that she has had to be lumbered with this horrible piece of humanity.  Also, really, if you think about Charles and Camilla, that wasn’t very savoury either, but the English have short memories, and now all is forgiven and Dianna has been air brushed away.  Very sad.

He was hardly going to have evidence of his crimes around the house for everyone to see. Especially a prince and his entourage.

A large chunk of what is essentially the part of the interview where he digs his own grave. Most iconic and famous parts of the interview are mainly from here to about 26 minutes into the video

Unfortunately, he manifests that he is NOT an  honorable man, I.e., he has no sense of God's value but that of the world. Epstein's friendship was special to him, not the young girls and women from whom he had had his self-gratification, reducing them to things to be used to release his basal needs. In fact, the US Court's sex trafficking charges on Epstein  was a non-issue to him. On the contrary his title in the Royal Navy was vital to him as his entitlement to the British monarchy. Titles, medals, entitlements - empty decorations - which he did not have to assiduously work  for, except for being a son of the monarch, are worthwhile to him! ANDREW LIES! ANDREW IS A DISGRACE!

"Foolish for Prince Andrew to grant an interview. Nothing he can say can help him. 
The police cannot prosecute because the minions of the media are offended by sordid behaviour. The accused has to have broken a law enacted by Parliament. The relevant law is the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which raised the age of consent for prostitutes to 18.

The putative complainant was over the age of 18 in 2003. Did she give consent as set out in the 2003 Act? Did she give consent  before 2003 when the age of consent for prostitutes was 16 and she was 17? 
There is the rub. How does a judge and jury decide on 20-year old evidence that the alleged victim did not give consent?
And it is no good saying that no prostitute gives consent. Because prior law and the 2003 Act presume that prostitutes do give consent. The onus is upon the prosecution to rebut this presumption. The Met Police know that the rules of evidence present an obstacle that cannot be overcome.

The same laws that protect ordinary people also protect the rich and mighty. Knock down the law to get at the Devil and none of us could survive the whirlwind that would follow.",[],2021-10-11T14:31:09Z,@fwcolb

"Guiffre´s scandal has the power to bring down the whole monarchy. Prince Andrew is just a scapegoat in all of this. Question is why do you believe this yacht girl, she had every opportunity to to walk away, & make the complaint when it happened, she wasn't underage.
She thinks because he's a Prince she can get a good payout. Parents couldn’t handle her. She ran away aged 13 and was then a street kid who was put into prostitution. It’s not ok to be a prostitute then accuse your clients of assault and complete a witch hunt by media. I find curious is that if Guiffre said she was sexually abused by PA 3 times, why did she get anywhere near him after the first time. A person is innocent until it they have been proven guilty, at this time it is purely accusations that have been brought forward. Thereˇs no evidence he broke any laws. Guiffre was above the age of consent in the UK and in NYC. She was above the age of consent at the time anyway, she was paid for her 'services´. Why did the police do nothing for decades about all the minors Epstein deflowered himself? Please, stop infantilising this woman. She is responsible for her poor choices.

"The following except from an article on the sweating phenomenon Andrew claims affected him suggests to me that unless Andrew can produce a physician who can vouch for such a diagnosis or (or a physician’s medical report or notes to provide documentation), Andrew’s claim is implausible and probably fabricated. (I have bolded some of the cited text for emphasis.)

“A complete absence of sweating is called anhidrosis. It can occur in particular areas of the body or be global – where more than 80% of the body has no ability to sweat. The causes are usually damage or pathology of the nervous system, or they may be inherited, such as in the case of Sjogrens Syndrome. Some individuals suffer from hypohidrosis which is a reduction in sweating and can be indicative of dehydration.”

“Regarding Prince Andrew’s claim, *an excess or continual exposure to adrenaline is not widely recognised as causing a lack of sweating in humans.* However, there is some data in horses that has suggested that exposure to extreme temperatures may result in damage to the type of sweat glands that respond to adrenaline.”

“Similarly, the fact that the central nervous system, and parts of it that are linked to controlling the “fight or flight” response system, can also be involved or damaged in psychological trauma, means it is impossible to rule out this possibility without more information. There are a number of reports of individuals who have developed an idiopathic (unexplained) inability to sweat during military and extreme training.”

"Watching this interview was genuinely HILARIOUS.  Gloria Allred's attorney daughter, Lisa Bloom, claims that ""we have come a long way"" in exposing crimes against women and human beings in general.  But let's have a look at the record, shall we??

First, human slavery is at the highest level in the entire history of mankind, with little children comprising much of it, making the same shoes and clothing we wear every single day.  Many are sold into sexual slavery as well, with wealthy customers like Randy Andy here benefitting directly from their misery.  But this is certainly nothing new, it's been going on for ages.  Those will enormous wealth and power have abused children since the dawn of recording time, and more recently with the vast crimes of the Roman Catholic Church to add to the list, certainly nothing of note.  None of these criminals ever get punished, because their friends are actively participating in the same crimes.  The names in Jeffery Epstein's ""Little Black Book"" comprises everyone from celebrities, to presidents, to princes, and before he could name names, he was murdered in his high security lockup in New York City, with both cameras broken and both guards sound asleep.  What an amazing coincidence.

As far as The Party Prince goes, however, as long as there are corrupt judges, senators, police, pedophiles, sexual deviates, and other associated individuals, such prostitution rings will continue to grow and flourish.  Even with Harvey Weinstein gone, the casting couch continues, along with other associated crimes to numerous to mention.

It's so easy to read between the lines. He did some things he wasn't supposed to do and got scared when Epstein got caught and had to go have a talk with him. What got me was him saying he doesn't regret his friendship with Epstein because he made good connections with some influential people.

"Ultimately, the British people need to take a serious look at the way their country is governed and decide if they really want a gilded family at the top of it. These people have been on a pedestal all their lives and yet they’re just ordinary human beings like the rest of us. This Prince is totally deluded of his own self-importance because of the life he’s lived.","['@True-Spirit100 you’re as deluded as Andrew if you think that 90% of the U.K. approve of the monarchy.', ""Yes we do. Our Monarchy has survived the test of time and they have done well for the United Kingdom. They are human beings also but have proved worthy of their roles supporting the King or Queen in his or her role as the Constitutional Monarchy. If one member is not worthy of his or her role then they are resigned from it. They are individuals who can carry on with their own affairs. So does Prince Andrew. No one can dictate.\n\nThe protocols are laid down in the constitution and the working Royals abide by it. There are also the Palace Protocols to follow in order to run the Establishment smoothly as expected. 90% of us are happy with it. We won't change it for the world for the fancy of you or any other.\n\nWe have seen the disarray in many republican countries, new and old. Corruption and backstabbing and murder. Democracy is actually not working in many Countries. Go and clean your own countries rather than interfering with our Constitutional Monarchy."", ""To @מט ג'ורג -  If you want replies to your comments you should make a fair English translation to your name as it is playing havoc and rides to the right when clicked on it, proving it to be middle eastern writing.
