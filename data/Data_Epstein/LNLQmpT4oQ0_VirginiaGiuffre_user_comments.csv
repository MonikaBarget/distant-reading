Epstien was connected to many people including Trump the current POTUS. This would not have been tolerated by any other president. Look at where Andrew is now, evicted and dethroned stripped of royalty- that did not occur from this ONE story and one picture. 
The governor of New Mexico Bill is now dead, but he was confirmed as one of the creeps.  
Bill Clinton another perv whom also was a POTUS.

She and many others have said it was-
The rich, wealthy, royalty, politicians those whom run the world people need to reflect on this carefully. 

If Trump is not in this, then he or someone close to him is protecting someone else up there that has blackmail on Trump or someone very close.

CALL THEM ALL OUT people do not give a flying F if it is Obama or the Pope- doubtful, but if it is call em out too. It isn't a political party thing it is very much an ethical and moral thing. There is no place for this type of behavior. 

That said, this woman did not commit suicide. Her ex husband probably was found given money and he sold her out why else would he have taken her kids successfully then hold a service and cremate her without her family having the chance to say good bye? What are the odds she'd get into this accident and what are the odds she would later end up willfully leaving when her brother was on his way?

The following day, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell.[12] Her husband was also abusive of her and she was fighting for custody of her children (she had 3 with her ex husband) Robert accused Virginia of breaching a family violence restraining order in February and a court hearing was set.[134] For several months afterward, she was prevented from seeing her children.

I felt connected from young but mixed in w the connection was evidence… and they help when moments of doubt come… because I’ve seen proof first hand… without any way to prove to others.I wish that for everyone 🌼 I’m not religious or new age… just know we’re all connected.  After atheism I was seeking answers big time and God finally told me this~ and this helped me end my seeking “God is Love & Mystery.” and that people developed religion for control and because they can’t stand the “I don’t know”  I pray you find you experience your own personal evidence but it’s all ok no matter what! You are loved & eternal 💜 \nEven though my life hasn’t been easy and still isn’t ~ I know my life, your life, all our lives are meaningful!!!\n\nEdit~ spelling :)']",2025-11-11T01:45:21Z,@BritBee-v7g8x

What people don't tell you about abuse is that it perpetuates more abuse by eroding your sense of worthiness and sense of self.

"So, Virginia says she was trafficked at Naomi Campbell's birthday party, and the interviewer does not ask to 'WHO'?

Virginia says that Epstein trafficked her to someone that was physically abusive to punish her. And the interviewer does not ask to 'WHO'?

What is it with these victims and not naming names? Because, until you are ready to hold these people accountable, this is just an interesting fiction.

*******
To be honest, my faith in my government, and the humanity of the people who take jobs in law enforcement has been completely destroyed by the Epstein case. Here we have multiple witnesses and evidence - the girls trafficked, the men and women who abused them, Epstein's support staff, pilots and more - hundreds or thousands of witnesses plus video evidence. And yet, the FBI is sitting on their hands, burying and perhaps destroying evidence to cover the elite who are involved. I cannot tell you how this enrages me.

And this does not simply implicate republicans, or Trump. Biden had a chance to prosecute it and didn't. Trump 45 had a chance and didn't. Obama didn't. Bush didn't. Clinton not only didn't, but was getting head in the white house. As an aside, what kind of woman would blow a married guy in the white house? We are always making this about men, but Monika was not trafficked - she was there of her own will. But I digress....

What was the wildest thing about her is, how that upbringing made her seemingly naive and completely blind to suspicious people.

"I totally understand her and believe her 100%.

As someone who has in my past hungout in the wealthy members clubs of London like Tramp, Drama, Annabels, the way these people casually and subtly display their power, it is scary. I remember having gone to a party and the penthouse owner had taken a liking to me. One other guest started suggesting that you should keep him company and if you try to leave, the rich guy will act disappointed. If you’re someone who's a people pleaser and not from that world, you start feeling awful. It's a way to guilt tripping you. Seems like everyone's walking on eggshells and the success of the party depends on the host getting what he wants. You get almost scolded for ""not being fun"". They do ask questions about yourself, like you're an innocent curiosity. Then they suggest, ""would it be fun to fly here or there, have you ever been""? The rich owner always wants to give you a private tour of their penthouse or country house just to be alone with you.
They have 0 sense of time. They suggest the wildest thing in a sec, than change their minds the next. It's just ever impossible to know when they are serious or not. You start getting scared because you notice how unstable some of these rich guys are. 

 I am lucky I was never trafficked and i left the environment very, very fast after I was spiked at Annabels. I called to complain but the club never called responded to my demand for an investigation. The Met police thought I was some drunk girl and didn't get me to A&E for a rape kit and blood test. I had nightmares for weeks after this and found bruises on my body that I couldn't recall. 

Everything she said about being lost, exhausted, losing sense of time, being at their mercy, feeling powerless, I absolutely believe it.

She's right about the staff turning a blind eye because the staff sees you, the woman in danger as a rich brat that they envy or just a hooker.

What she also said about Ghislaine being posh and impressive is also something I felt. You feel impressed with these posh women surrounding them. These women are meant to give you a false sense of security, thinking you're not alone with just men and these men act like gentlemen with these women so you think you're part of the posh girl club too.",[],2025-11-10T04:26:33Z,@stephaniel2525

"I don't like the way Tara Brown conducted this interview. The tone of her questions are not of someone genuinely trying to understand Virginia. She comes across as judgemental questioning Virginia's decisions and choices. Why did you comply? Why did you accept their proposal? Why didn't  you say anything to anyone?  Virginia tried to explain the best that she could her why.  It seems to me that Tara Brown has no knowledge of how the psyche of a young woman who was molested since age 7, doesn't have the capacity to say no or to look for a way out.  I questioned if Virginia really had options. We have seen the response from the authorities when woman have reported being molested by powerful people. Think Harvey Weinstein. It took years before justice was finally served. for both Weinstein and Epstein.","['Perhaps the interviewer was asking those questions to give Virginia a lead to enable her to describe the horrors she endured.

"7:48 I don’t think this is gullible - we are encouraged to believe ‘making it’ can look like this, but that is on purpose, because it benefits the abusers (as we can see) and doesn’t discourage engaging in the ‘real work force’ 

Scams only work because there is an aspect of believability since they are working within a framework that’s been legitimized by other ‘good actors’ (at least not wholly bad actors anyways)

Having been previously abused and traumatized and not yet having worked through it, they were even more at risk of giving benefit to the doubt
Abuse thrives in the benefit of the doubt
And we are traumatized so this can be manipulated further


If this is gullibility, then why didn’t pop pop take pause?


Gullibility puts the onus on us, the community and victims
We are led to believe our world is safe and we are not unreasonable to behave as if that is true
It is the abusers who are unreasonable for being abusers - child sex traffickers at that, the worst of the worst

"Society often let's down the innocent, the corruption, the cowardly, the greedy and the morally laxed selfish people are disgusting human beings, if you can call them that.😶

I was sexually harassed at work and no one spoke up, everybody put on a facade of decency and moral standing but no one spoke up or did the right thing. I get where Virginia Giuffre is coming from, society often let the innocent down.

My heart hurts for Virginia Giuffre and my stomach churns with pain for all that she has had to go through in most of her lifetime. Even the ""husband"" she met in Thailand from Australia ended up abusing her, he beat her to a pulp and once again where were her friends and family and her younger brothers grown up by the time of this interview did not protect her either. Shaking my head at all these people in her life, they all failed her.

Why were her parents not there for her, why did they never develop a relationship or a bond with Virginia, how can a family friend abuse her from the age of 7-11, that is 4 years, were her parents deaf dumb and blind? 

Throughout the whole interview Virginia explained herself well but there seems to be a disconnect which is totally understandable, I don't think Virginia knew that she was traumatized and the interviewer is pretty cold, didn't even hand Virginia a tissue when tears streamed down her face, she just wanted to get to the meat of the story.

Too many cowards in the world and not enough courageous people to keep society accountable and decent.

The operative sentence was 12 yrs old, Trump said that was his maximum age that he will not go under for women. All these nasty ugly horny men with money and power destroying so many lives. 😢

Epstein was definitely a sex addict, for him to have the urge to have sex every 2 hrs, that is a sex addict but he also knew how to be a high class pimp in order to make money and to use blackmail to protect himself as a pedophile. Ghislaine Maxwell is one cold evil b*TCH, I hope she and all the pedophiles burn in hell😈, may karma come to get them all.

Too many pedophiles with money and power protecting the other pedophiles. Society and the people need to rise up until the Epstein files are released. All the nasty pedophiles need to be held accountable. From the professors, politicians, doctor's, lawyers and Prince Andrew that nasty piece of shit is 💯 % guilty for having sex with a minor(Virginia Giuffre) Sarah Ferguson(Prince Andrew's wife) knew it but turned a blind eye, the nasty wench was paid off by Epstein. I know Alan Dershowitz is an Epstein customer for sure, why else would the old shriveled prune threaten Virginia so hard? No way can an Epstein lawyer(Alan Dershowitz) get massages from really young girls at Epstein's mansion and not have had sex with the girls. Alan Dershowitz admitted he got massages from the young girls. Virginia's lawyers should not have backed down, they did Virginia an Injustice by backing down from that nasty old prune Alan Dershowitz(I am sorry that is all I see everytime Alan Dershowitz's face shows up anywhere in the news).

Virginia Giuffre was killed for sure, how the bus hit her car and then she died at home, I think her husband was pressured into killing her. You can tell that she had always held hope in her heart that people would do the right thing by her and that she wanted to be happy. I think the fact that she was a tomboy when she was young is what got her through all the horrific circumstances in her life.

Society can still redeem themselves by globally fighting for the 1000s of Epstein victims. Make it an epic pandemic of social support, keep talking about it on all social media outlets. Share any and all information that you can on the Epstein victims and pedophiles, especially name names and post pictures of the all the nasty pedophiles, that is the least society can do now for the victims.

And parents pls form a relationship and bond with your kids and don't let your kids be alone with adults, yes even with friends and other family members, always make sure they are with you and talk to them about the dangers of the world, child sex traffickers, drugs and bullies and show them what to do and how to avoid or get out of those situations and how to collect evidence. A sock has DNA, a pair of undies, sheets, don't shower and get a rape test done, all the steps to take, if you don't know it, google it and learn it so you can protect your kids.

As for bullies, parents can always file a harrassment case against any bullies, yes even underaged kids to the police, have them and the parents charged if the bullying does not stop, online or physically. Talk to your kids on a friend's level and always ask them if they are being bullied or approached inappropriately.

Obviously an interview for 60 minutes is going to be public. Obviously there are going to be questions. This isn't a therapy session. Virginia wanted to discuss this. Nobody forced her to give this interview and bring lawsuits and write books. She wanted to share her story. Instead of shaming the interviewer you should be praising Virginia for having the courage to share her story. She made a brave choice. Why are you refusing to accept that? She was a strong woman who wanted to use her voice. Why are you acting like she was a fragile glass unicorn who should have been too ashamed to do this interview? I think YOU acting like women need to be ashamed and passive about their stories is a big part of the problem.\xa0Why do you have trouble with strong women speaking out?\n\nAnd obviously the police and her abusers aren't going to agree to an interview.

I've always felt that if someone commits a severe crime, and there is CLEAR evidence to prove it, then before they are imprisoned ( into a harsh prison without benefits that some people don't even have that have never committed a crime ), they should be thrown to the parents/families of the victims to do as they wish, if they survive that, then shove them in a prison that does NOT give them a great quality of life.

This despicable, fascistic murderer is just as bad as EpStain and Maxwell, even if he can show that he didn't participate in anything beyond lusting after his own 12 year old daughter and having sex with Melatonia in EpStain's Lolita Express Airplane when he first met her.
Of course, we all know that the fact that he hasn't released the EpStain files and/or videos- is because his name is all over them just like the thoughts he expressed in his 50th Birthday card.
Lastly, do you suppose your Ex-prince andrew will be motivated to kill himself because he's now lost his dignity, titles, free home, and has to arrange his own dolls on his bed from now on?

"It’s heartbreaking and shocking to hear  Virginia Giuffre’s terrifying sexual abuses in the hands ofJeffrey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell.  From Epstein’s and Maxwell’s sex trafficking ring and to those who were complicit in the covering up of this horrific crime is beyond belief.  But most unfortunate of all, is the number of people in high status involved politically, economically,  in the entertainment industry and the  profession to be considered as Epstein’s and Maxwell’s elite clientele, or not reporting these sexual assaults.  But most of all, is Virginia’s father who sold his minor daughter to these sexual assault perverts for $200.00?  Oh Lord, help us to make sense of all of this!

Her daughter would be exposed to places and things she could never afford. She would see life with a family that is whole instead of being home alone during summer in the projects.

When I see her father, I get so angry. That he even dares to give interviews. What would have become of your daughter if you had been the father every daughter deserves? I despise you as I despise everyone who did this to Virginia. 

Yes, they say they will be punished when they stand before their creator. For many, that may be enough, but not for me. Because how many children and young people are going through hell every minute? Because these inhuman beings, these criminals, are walking around free and are not being held accountable. Why? Because they hold high positions around the world? Because then the world would be turned upside down? So what? How much worse can it get in this world? It can only get better. 
So everyone protects everyone else and the horror just goes on.

I should forgive them, then God will forgive them too? I don't know how I can forgive that.
I am a victim of my childhood and youth. What would have become of me if I had had a happy childhood? It's pointless to ask, because I'll never know. Children's souls are so easy to break. 
I had hoped so much that Virginia had found the happiness with her husband that she so deserved. Learning what happened in her marriage makes me so incredibly sad. 
I hope Virginia's children will one day realize what kind of woman their mother was.🙏
A woman who had the courage and refused to be silenced. Who was strong for herself and others. Who gave us victims a voice.

"A young female family member was abused by her cousin from when she was six years old until she was 12, the male cousin was 14 when it started and around 19, when it stopped, due to her being able to avoid him easier as she got older
From a really happy well behaved little girl who was very intelligent in regard to her school work, she became a troublesome child and became very rebellious and ended up being excluded from two separate secondary schools, while her family had no idea why her personality had changed so much.
After keeping her dark secret for some 20 years, and after having moved away from the area she grew up in, she contacted her abuser on social media in attempt to find some closure.  The abuser responded and pretty much admitted his guilt and apologised.  
Some months later after careful consideration she decided to take this information to the police and he was arrested.  He was found guilty by an unanimous jury verdict and was given a custodial sentence of seven and a half years, which was later reduced to five on appeal.

"All the comments here sympathizing with this demon's tall tales of victimhood confirm for me that this must be hell and we must all be fallen angels. This woman is pure evil.  no doubt in my mind that Epstein was a womanizer and user.  Maybe ghislaine served him in locating young female volunteers.  Probably.  But in no way do I believe she was abused.  Absolutely not. I see a volunteer in her.  A very willing volunteer. I was her age when she started volunteering to learn 'massage' as she calls it.  I was that age.  And I was dumb as a doornail.  And even I would have had the sense to speak and back out of the volunteer massage when it started to look creepy.  She continued to engage.  And did so hundreds of times.  Volunteered.  No chains. No jail. No guns. No duress.  She wanted to be around rich people, travel without having to pay,  get male attention and money , and marry a rich guy. Its that last thing she could never accomplish which is why she is attacking them.  She is trying to collect what she feels KS due her for her time.  A rich man should have married her in her opinion.  He didnt.  She was resentful in later llife and decided to spin the volunteer story into 'abuse' to pump the money out of it that she feels should have been hers through marriage to one of those old perverts she volunteered to 'massage.'.

"Something is very wrong with this story.  Why was Virginia  Giufre living in the streets hooked on drugs and trading sex for food before she even went to Mar-Lago in the first place?

She was already a teenage prostitute before she met any of these ""rich & powerful"" people.

Granted, when she went to Mar-A-Lago, she actually thought she could get clean and start over.  She was actually doing fairly well there and treated right.

She was targeted by Gislane  Maxwell, because Maxwell was a predator and she saw her vulnerability.

My point is, where was her family, her brother's.  Now they come forward and show so much interest and emotion? 

Some teenage girls used to get taken advantage of at that age in those days, it wasn't uncommon, that's where the term young and stupid comes from?

What has to look at the big picture and decipher truth from fiction. 

I think it was a far cry from trading sex from for food to sleeping with a prince of England.
