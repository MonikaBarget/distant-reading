Was this released before she died? If not you are part of the problem / []
I have something , I want you to ponder for a moment .  Why do people follow the wealthy and powerful ?  I think it’s because they emulate them , thinking they can gain insight into how copying the rich and powerful to gain the wealth and power . / []
I am glad her suffering is over but I'm sad that her battle with depression ended her life. Virginia, you were a good woman who took on the powerful and I hope that we can live up to your expectation and hope to hold them accountable. / []
I am truly heartbroken for what she went through.  It's easy to see how a girl who was sexually abused as a child would turn to prostitution. / []
I want to know why the models aren't talking. he was in charge of Victoria's Secret bragged about it recruited with it. where are the women who were collecting million dollar salaries while they trotted a runway with nothing but underpants and wings on hmm?  Where are they? Why aren't they talking. why is it so silent / []
Fu--kers, RIP. I pray her soul is healed. I cry for the child and every other child abused and betrayed in such a horrible way. ❤ / []
I mean everything that happened to her is awful. And those scumbags who did that are evils. But why on earth did she stay? She wasn’t taped, she chose to do that for money. I’m sorry but I’d rather starve than prostitute myself. 17 year old for her generation isn’t like nowadays. I am her age and you had to be wise and careful. To me she kind of chose that path - an ugly one. / []
To be a billionaire you have to be greedy.  Some are greedy but follow the laws but others are greedy and break the laws. / []
Is it me or does the interviewer seem not equipped to do the interview? Like her understanding of the situation and fairly basic understanding of people seem surface level. / []
David I c ke’s new channel goes into a great deal of detail. He says this is merely the tip of the tip of the iceberg. / []
Watching the part where she talks about suicide and having an angel on her side, makes me so so sad. I really wonder if she truly committed suicide. They need to realease the files and everyone who was involved needs to be brought to justice. Her blood is on their hands! / []
thanks for the truth. thanks for handling the interview with care where possible / []
Make  FLYERS .SHARE 📢 SHARE 📢SHARE📢 . MAKE POSTERS ‼️‼️‼️📢 MAKE SIGNS 💥‼️‼️📢 SHARE 📢 SHARE📢SHARE . / []
Too many very crazy losers / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES. At 45:00, she points out all the doctors, psychologists, stylists, dentists, and others who enabled the abuse. ALL of them should be held responsible. / []
1:10:00.  That's right.  It is ALL of our responsibility to not turn a blind eye,  and to put work in to stop this!  We can all take online trainings of how to spot and safely and successfully report trafficking.   Operation Underground Railroad has a free and excellent online course.  And there are  many other organizations we can donate to and volenteer with. / []
By not naming the people involved she smeared all of them. This should not be okay with anyone. I feel for her but her sweeping accusations leave me feeling less sympathetic. / []
its got to be remembered,"it was her choice" / []
1:06:35. 1:04:00.  1:05  She said he always wanted 'the younger the better. '  How many babies did he raise for the sole purpose of sex trafficked innocent incredibly young children?!!  😭 / []
Ghislaine had established credibility meeting her at Maralago. Credibility opens all doors. It’s a slimy manipulative thing to use it for evil. / []
Idiot naive Dad. Dropping his daughter off for a nighttime job interview. 😮 / []
Isn’t it pretty obvious that she couldn’t tell her mom and dad protected her when she was seven how did she think they were going to protect her now? / []
Her parents knew before it even happened to her / []
RIP beautiful lady, I'm so sorry 😢 / []
I dont understand how the parents didn't ask where their teen daughter was during all the time she was trafficked. Blows my mind!! / []
Such courageous woman. RIP Virginia / []
why does this reporter keep smirking ???? / []
when they pulled out that picture of her with naomi or epstein, she looks like a freaking baby. the way no one said anything makes me realize how normalized this behavior is amongst those people. so gross, especially seeing grown women around. makes me feel disgusted. / []
This is just one such empire in the world. Hyper focusing on this one without acknowledging that fact does a disservice to us all. He wasn’t the biggest, or the worst, or even the best connected. Just unlucky. Remember, he was instantly replaced. / []
I believe the victims!!! / []
I have so many questions..... / []
This interview explains so much- Jeffrey had info on all these rich men and used it to blackmail- so it would make sense he had a lot of info on Trump- pictures, videos etc.     Karma is coming Donald.    My prediction- Maxwell will be pardoned soon / []
She wanted adventure. Probably begging her parents to let her go. When she realized what she was involved with.,..... . couldn't she have said no ? She needed Jesus 100% / []
I hope people aren't so stupid to assume every single celebrity and powerful person up there doesn't know exactly what is going on. She's talking about Naomi Campbell's birthday party, an example of an event where hundreds of powerful people are. Intelligent people. You don't think they know exactly who their friends are ?  They can see these Children at these events,  at their pals homes,  being carted around like property. No one doesn't known that these kids are sex slaves. Wake up and stop worshipping theses people. If they know and they do nothing they're part of the gang. / []
That this survivor who was so intelligent, articulate & hopeful yet succumbed to suicide is a severe tragedy in itself. Why was her husband allowed to take away her children & not let them see their mother? He turned against her the same way every male in her life from her early childhood turned against her and abused her. My heart breaks for her....we lost an important advocate & gentle soul the sad day Virginia left this earth. / []
Funny that Trump is willing to bomb yachts on the idea that they might be trafficking drugs but nothing about trafficking humans / []
I dont know why they wont release the files if Epstein is now dead? Wouldnt surprise me if Starmer is in there... / []
Who’s behind neomi Campbell?  He looks way familiar. / []
Thank you for your articulate nature, honesty and bravery, Virginia.❤ It is obvious that she was murdered. This is unacceptable to just accept. / []
What a terrible waste of a young life. The kind of people who abused Virginia would never come forward because they are not wired up like normal people. They are incapable of doing anything good / []
i'd like someone anyone to explain to me if this woman did not like being trafficked, why did she stick around, ?, and lets face it her own words she knew it was wrong, not chained up had the freedom to go anywhere, so why did she stay, ?  she was not forced to stay, so please explain that, i bet no one tries to explain it, / []
Far too many people had it out for her. Powerful people. I hope that Virginia is at peace. I believe she is now, but unfortunately gone too soon. / []
Virginia was not trafficked, she went willingly with Epstein. She did the same things as Ghislaine has been accused of. / []
Finally at eternal rest,….miss  Virginia Giuffre (pronounced: “Jew Free”) is free….😮 / []
Did the parents know? What kind of people are they? / []
“Money should not buy you the power to get away with hurting people.” And at the minors… yet the wealthy do and the little guys get thrown in jail immediately… if the system doesn’t work for all, it is broken… we have a class issue in the world and I’m sick and tired of the system working for some and not all / []
This is crazy and weird 😢 / []
I don’t understand why she chose to bare her soul to this network and this obvious heartless interviewer / []
This girl DID NOT commit suicide! / []
RELEASE THOSE FKG FILES !!!!! Nnn / []
R I P / []
Tragic / []
God Bless, AZ, and Ms Grajalva May WE the People finally see justice for the victims, a hope for all victims famous and not famous. / []
When trying to rememmber the timelimes of when things like this happened, try to remember the pop culture.  What songs were always on the radio.  What TV shows played in the background.  Who was on magazine covers.  What was on the news.  If you had access to those things. / []
Am wondering: The mariage, was it an ish arranged  thing, ... making her believe it was fate? / []
They killed her / []
This is horrifying!  How did these sick monsters even find each other?  She was the champagne at parties? I am just sick.  This poor woman.  May she rest in peace.   I shudder to think how many victims there are 😢 / []
Virginia deserves justice the least❤ / []
I dont like how the interviewer questions her... as if she didnt believe her at points. You can tell that she as a victim has always doubted that she is believed and feels she is stupid for allowing this to happen to her. She keeps making excuses for why she was a victim and why she allowed it to happen to her. NO! She was a child. This happened and there is no excuse. They were predators and they were able to do this to more than 1 person. They obviously had a very powerful, authoritative and imposing way about them. There is no way to explain it unless you're there... / []
Knowing that she’s not here today is so devastating. It’s not right / []
I'm so sorry Virginia what you had too go threw when you where a child and the other evil things after that, being s*trafficked too Epstein and his rich friends. What your husband did.  He should be in prison for the abuse you suffered from him. The justice system in Australia failed you! Taking away your children and made you feel like you had no hope. Rest In peace. / []
Poor girl, horrible story, disgusting those criminals!  Justice must prevail! / []
A billion dollar industry and we are blindsided and kept busy with celebrities,  fake news and trash tv whilst the rich play with the most vulnerable as if the toy of the day.. this poor woman was so courageous and strong for only so long, because abuse takes its toll, no matter the recovery.. sentences should be harsher, no slap on the wrist for any form of it! Release the files........... / []
She was a revolter she said it herself she knew what she was doing she even recruited for Jeff happily she wanted money. Why didn’t she release all those elites name ?  The fact is she got her revenge on Andrew with money and degrading his status and still Got no one other than Jeff and Maxwell so why didn’t she release more ?    These comments are ridiculous giving her pass on being truthful / []
As a professional, I could not sit there with an apathetic, heartless, unsympathetic look on my face as she poured out her feelings. I guess it is because I was molested as a child and never married and never bore children all my life. / []
The fact that they asked Virginia to birth them a child was  so disgusting. I can only imagine what they planned to do to. / []
Story sounds off....if some of this is true Father was definitely in on it just from the first story...looks like a money grabbed I know that sounds heartless but money makes people do crazy shit😢 / []
R.I.P Virginia / []
Where is Snowdon? He will give us some names. Come on  hackers!!! Get on it. / []
You will never be forgotten, Jenna. NEVER. / []
The tragedy is that it is a whole group of people who were completely complicit or asleep at the wheel for this young girl.  I can't imagine a father dropping off a 16-year-old girl for a "massage therapist" job.  What was he thinking unless he was also paid off? / []
What an amazing women!  Let’s hold the monster’s accountable! / []
At 28.00 - Naomi Campbell and the guy fixing his tie next to her have a lot to answer too. Facial expressions and body language show they see the young girl right in front of them, and knew exactly what it was all about. But hey money and fame mattered more to them and even now they're not coming forward. I hope they feel the guilt for allowing and supporting this horrific abuse. / []
Mar ago, connection hmmmm. / []
😢😢😢😢😢 / []
This interviewer sounds extremely accusatory. Ew. / []
rest in peace you brave brave woman / []
None of those "other girls " gave, and got paid to do tv interviews.... / []
You were complicit! / []
So why did none of "the other girls" ever came forward to corroborate her story? / []
😢😢😢 / []
This is Heartbreaking , and for the Interview to continue is Disgusting @ 14:20 I’m Out !! / []
Sorry,  but she had plenty of opportunities to escape,  was the money too good? / []
I just have to wonder why, at that point with the first massage, didn't she just say no. / []
It’s heartbreaking that we live in a society where predators can walk freely without facing any consequences, while the victims are left to carry the burden themselves. This woman went through something that no one, especially someone so young should ever have to experience. She was so eloquent and composed in that interview despite everything she endured. It’s truly tragic that she passed away. Her words deserve to be heard and shared widely so that everyone, especially young girls, can learn from her story. Rest in peace beautiful angel! 😢❤❤ / []
Im wondering what part the church plays with facilitate theses , misleading behaviors. / []
The FBI has videos and photos. They know who all the child molesters are. They are being protected. Why??? We should be protecting children, not abusers. / []
Wish she was still here / []
Clown will lose the most should the Epstein story exploded to be true 🤡😂😂😂 / []
Behind you all the way ❤ / []
I feel so sad for this beautiful woman and all the others just like her. I hope her abusers are given many years behind bars. / []
Some People are extremely sick!!!!! And evil!!!! / ['What a beautiful person. Wish she had did not have to go through what she did. How evil are some people!']
For a poorly educated person, she is so well spoken. Her intelligence and sensitivity are outstanding. / []
Too long a video. What names did she name? / []
There is a lot of trafficking in the world sadly. This is high profile case because of famous people being involved. Other abuses will stay unknown and unpunished. / []
PURE FAKE NEWS / []
Heartbreaking. I don’t quite understand why she was happy to name Andrew but no other of the people who abused her. / []
Ughly!!! / []
Their will never be justice, the department of justice is powerless, / []
Why didn’t she escape?  She was smiling at pictures? / []
So how many of the people that abused her have gone to prison or complained on by her? / []
Sad thing is there are many more out there like epstein all over the world. Corruption is rife. / []
Her death was suspicious to say the least / ['Many others, myself included, think the same']
Virginia was 'TRAFFICKED' and 'FORCED' to be a 'sex slave'....a 'prostitute'. She had NO choice. Really........are we all expected to be so gullible and believe all of this rubbish? She became a brain damaged individual with suicidal agenda. Despite the compensation she was still so damaged she gave herself no other choices in life. Pathetic.... / []
Such a sad story. Maxim Ghislaine should never be pardoned. / []
The most saddening thing is that the rich and/or powerful will never face consequences. Sure, to the outside eye, they'll strip them of some letters in their name, but they'll never go to prison. / []
It's outrageous how the journalist treats Virginia. It's a mixture of disgust and disapproval. I can't understand the journalist's lack of humanity / []
And another thing we need to face here   HE was NOT working alone  or without commmand. Why are the true criminals still protected ???? / []
23:00 1) It is the 'dangling carrot' of hope mixed with 2) worthless depression and 3) a tidal wave of anxiety.  ... 1) Get paid well from someone who has more than enough,  and them giving/ showing you a path to becoming a certified massage therapist.  Then never being vulnerable or abused again (kids have no clue how others get certified, and figuring out the process is scary to them. )   - 2) It is that dangling 'cover your eyes' hope that your life nightmare will get better,  mixed with the trauma-induced deep depression That includes the deep feelings of loathing and worthless and wishing you could hide or be dead rather than admit  what just happened to you to yourself and others. ---3)  It is like having that tortured 7 year old just curling up into a ball and following orders, alone shouldering the crushing anxiety of not knowing if there will be retribution if you tell or do not comply.   ❤️‍🩹💔🥺 / []
She was Destroyed by Society and I Don't Like It One Bit. / []
I have one question,   Why was this video (assuming there were no major redactions of the content) released now, *after* the removal of Prince Andrew? / []
Looks like 60 minutes is only 8 years late in running this story.  Way to go / []
Did she ever meet anyone that didn't abuse her? / []
14:10. Even adults become deer-in-the-headlights when surprised by abuse.   One woman told me that when someone was carrying her out of the house to try to murder her, she tried to scream to other family members for help,  but it only came out as a whisper.  We all need to practice the fight or flight in our minds, so that we don't go into survival mode and just freeze. 😢🫂 / []
This woman is not the saint she is being depicted as. Granted she had a real sicko upbringing but also noticed in her @interview” with Jeffrey Epstein she made sure he knew she was sexually experienced. Like  who  does  that in an interview? / ['People who have been sa as children,  often do over share. \nShe may have hoped they would feel sympathy for her.  Predators are good at recognising those who have been abused & exploit it.']
She didn’t kill herself / []
I thought it was her dad that was doing that bad s*** to her sorry girl with RIP!!! No shame ❌!!!🙏🙏🙏 / []
She had changed her will, excluding her husband and leaving everything to her children. The divorce was not finalized and unfortunately her will wasn’t signed. I don’t think she would have killed her self without making sure her will was in tact! / []
She doesn’t sound like someone ready and/or wanting to end things. She sounds like she had a healthy fear for her safety. / []
She was a CHILD (and emotionally stunted child if you know anything about abuse and the impact). How can you expect a CHILD to know who they can trust when they have been repeatedly abused for years?  Too good to be true? It sounds like you’re victim blaming. NOT OK / []
Critical mass has been achieved. / []
🇺🇸 Release the Epstien Files!  🇺🇸 / []
Why not to mention family member who abused her at 7? Or others? It’s also a crime. Why??? / []
'It's corrupt to the core' what else do we need to know? We must purge power... To the core 🔥 / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES❕ / []
Where the hell were her parents??? How do you allow your kid to be travelling around the world without either parent there to protect her, surely they were paid out - they could not possibly be ignorant of what was happening, shame on them and Bless her soul, so much courage may she rest in peace knowing she will get justice, one day the files and more whistleblowers will come out, pressure to release the files is what is needed and not stop till it happens 💜💜💜 / []
Note to publisher: Why don't you publish ALL the names then? Not just Andrew! Bring all the offenders to justice! There is obviously a reason as to why this has not been done! / []
a minute in a half and she is already denting to reveal who it was. were done here / []
Is Trump refusing to release the files to protect Elon Musk. / []
You wonder how much the doctors where payed to stay quite? They should also have there license to practice pulled. / []
one thing people don't understand about sexual is abuse is that after you are shell shocked, you've lost it.  It binds you into doing whatever you get out of it, because you've already spent the important naiviety of yourself against your will.  to get nothing feels worse than at least gaining something for a permanent destruction such as that. / []
I do not believe her. She worked that " job " for money. Like others do. But her "clients" are bad but I guess the other s workers , like in a cat house, those clients are ok. Give me a break. She was only after money. That is my opinion. And as soon as there is no money coming in, you go and slander your " clients " and even lie about them. Like we seen with one she named. Did she ever sued the family member she accuses of doing something to her? Nope. That would not make her money and give her 5 min of fame in the news...  I have no sympathy for women working in that " job" and them scream and trash their clients. That is my opinion on her and most , not all, accusers in this Epstein saga. / ['Ah yes, blaming teenagers.']
Keep blasting this and all other stories.   Epstien was connected to many people including Trump the current POTUS. This would not have been tolerated by any other president. Look at where Andrew is now, evicted and dethroned stripped of royalty- that did not occur from this ONE story and one picture.  The governor of New Mexico Bill is now dead, but he was confirmed as one of the creeps.   Bill Clinton another perv whom also was a POTUS.  She and many others have said it was- The rich, wealthy, royalty, politicians those whom run the world people need to reflect on this carefully.   If Trump is not in this, then he or someone close to him is protecting someone else up there that has blackmail on Trump or someone very close.  CALL THEM ALL OUT people do not give a flying F if it is Obama or the Pope- doubtful, but if it is call em out too. It isn't a political party thing it is very much an ethical and moral thing. There is no place for this type of behavior.   That said, this woman did not commit suicide. Her ex husband probably was found given money and he sold her out why else would he have taken her kids successfully then hold a service and cremate her without her family having the chance to say good bye? What are the odds she'd get into this accident and what are the odds she would later end up willfully leaving when her brother was on his way? She was a threat, Epstien was a threat, Maxwell was a threat til she got her way.  Corruption is all out there clear as day / []
Why didnt these girls name the offenders? / []
Trafficked, seriously. Pimped perhaps. / []
The security guards as adults are watching the monitors they are witnesses to this abuse of Virginia and the other girls. Why aren't they being interviewed, investigated and or prosecuted? Will 60 Minutes do this? / []
Her body language indictactes she is not being truthful about the abuse when it gets to where the details are discussed she get evasive and her details change a lot like she cant remember what someone told her to say / []
I think she died with her self-respect restored and I hope her loved ones find comfort in that. She'd want to wrap her arms around other vulnerable children and it’s something we can all do. We're all somebody's baby who deserves a cherished life. / []
something i realized the minute i turned 18 was that adults have a responsibility to protect and shield children/minors in general from so many cruel things about this world. we cannot allow them to be introduced to things that can alter their perception of the world. children deserve to grow their own perspective on the world in the most carefree way, we have to protect them at all costs, and im just so overwhelmed and disappointed and disgusted that the adults in her life didn’t protect her. / []
After reading Andrew Lownie’s book “Entitled,” I am in total agreement with Virginia. The corruption of every system making up our living structure is in need of replacing. I know it will happen and I will celebrate when it does. / []
I hate how most of the questions in the beginning are asking her about why she did things why she followed orders? Why she trusted an adult? Why she's vulnerable? It's disgusting how much victims are dissected to explain themselves and not why did these predators do what they do. And the fact that she never got justice is appalling. / ['But lots of people would ask those questions.']
Is it just me; does the interviewer seem extremely cold and almost unbelieving? The gall of her to ask some of those questions too.  My God / ["I was noticing that too. And the creepy smile she kept during it all? Crazy. This isn't a moment a sane person would have a smile on their face.", '@FelonDogGlad I’m not the only one who noticed it']
I don't like this interviewer. She clearly only cares about the story. Not about what she's doing to Virginia, asking her such private questions. She. Doesn't. Care. / ["Yep, she's so cold; it's probably triggering for Virginia also, it seems she has a British accent like Maxwell!!😱"]
RIP / []
Why was she not protected by her Parents? / ['Did her father do sa and let others do? What about the mother?']
The Epstein files will never be released. / []
Believe the victims.  So so horrific that Epstein did this and Trump continues to try and cover it up. / []
Let's call it what it is: rape, and rape trafficking. / []
What a dear sweet soul. Such sadness in those eyes. Now it is our job to push for those files to be released. It’s the least we can do for Virginia and all those young women like her. / []
The journalists need to find out the doctors, dentists etc. / []
No one...and I mean no one should be above the law! This is sickening!  All these pedophiles and human traffickers should be brought to justice!!  No matter who they are...must be held accountable! / []
60 Minutes Australia, I think you MUST have this interview aired DAILY!!  Virginia will be remembered forever like the BRAVEST GIRL who learned to survive through "stylish abuse"... and still be able to articulate her inner saddest feelings while having to look like "enjoying her l.e.a.r.n.i.n.g." So, she was ... and will ever be loved by the raped and the abused girls and boys & children who have been unable to express themselves so bravely!! So, TRUMP MUST BE REALLY terrified by the Epstein Files... and being the corrupt "merchant" he has been proven to be, we must deduce he could have taken the "worst safe solutions" out of this trafficking web!! / []
OMG, we need the Epstein files unlocked! Who are these billionaires and politicians? / []
Familiarity breeds contempt she Never should have told them how horrible her life was before... / []
What a brilliant inspiring brave woman. I kept feeling surprised as i listened to her how eloquent how good a speaker she is given her upbringing and unfortunate past. RIP Virginia karma will finds them thanks for dightinf a good fight for every little child in the world / []
May you rest in eternal peace you beautiful soul Virginia…..you are  strength, beauty and bravery….❤❤❤🙏🏻 / []
😢 / []
It takes a lot of courage to tell a story. Story that societies all over keep on hiding from the general public but is actually the foundation of this world we live in. This has been exposed and we need help  to make this a better place for our future. Our children deserve Love, Protection and Divine guidance. I am proud of you. Your strength is shaping minds all over! Let your passing be our beacon! R.I.P.❤ / []
Thank you for this interview. It really allowed us to learn about Virginie’s experiences as a young person and she was so transparent and honest about her feelings. It is a great shame that she is no longer here on earth with us. I hope that she rests peacefully and I hope that justice is served to all the perpetrators. I believe they murdered her to silence her. / []
That photo of Naomi Campbell eyeing teenaged Virginia: she knew something was wrong. You can tell. / []
How could her parents even let her go away with Epstein? I can’t believe what a small child she was in those pictures! 😢 Did they know what was happening? Her dad worked in those circles even without the abuse he was ok with Virginia at the parties? / []
What a betrayal!! I cried for you. / []
It becomes  more obvious that Epstein and this brave woman were silenced by someone, who would not want to be exposed in the scandal. / []
This interviewer is AMAZING! ❤ / []
She would be so sad to know that a horrible person like Trump who may have been involved might let Maxwell go. Maxwell I'd be looking over my shoulder the rest of my life, which may not be very long. / []
So fucked up. And yet people pretend like they don't know who's names are in the files... And people talk righteous while consuming products, information, and services of the names on that list. / []
Will someone help me understand ..where was her loving family did they notice their 17 year old was not around.  to report her missing...if she wasnt missing from home but coming home at intervals didnt they ask where she  got that money 15000 from  each involvement ...was she iheld hostage? / []
Trump it’s time to pardon G.M. Let’s go! / []
It happens in every level of society forever 😢 since man kind was on earth / []
🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
😢😢😢 / []
Maxwell recruiting at mar a lago?  They allll knew what was up. / []
what an amazing woman, she should be TIME'S person of the year!!!! I just saw in the comments she is now gone???? they must of killed her, so so so sad, all the people who allow trafficking to go on need to be jailed!!!!! Education and transparency are a must to break the cycle. Her poor family must be devastated. Now I saw trump online say he may pardon  Ghislaine Maxwell and he wants to lower age of consent in usa for sex and marriage(he must be guilty too, wants her out and say no case, then kill her too) ???? 😇😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"I am making it publicly known that in no way, shape or form am I suicidal. ... If something happens to me – in the sake of my family do not let this go away and help me to protect them. Too many evil people want to see me quieted," she wrote in December 2019. / []
It was her father / []
I hope everyone sees this. Let’s all do our part. / []
I only wish she didn't feel she had to excuse herself so much. She was absolutely so young and they were predators. / []
When will there be justice for the victims of Samuel J.T. Moore, III, of Richmond, VA? / []
S/O TO 60 MINUTES FOR HAVING THE NUTS TO RELEASE THIS RIGHT NOW / []
It's heartbreaking that she is not here today and no, she did not commit suicide 😢 / []
They wanted her to have a kid so they could either drink it’s blood or turn it into a super star through a life of misery and MK ultra. / []
My heart is broken for her I'm reading her book now and I have to say it is so so heartbreaking I myself  am a survivor it's been 51 years but I live with the scars and memories I've learned to live my life to the fullest it has not been easy. My heart breaks for virgina and all the other woman and girls. / []
@13:00" - abuse coming from a woman was the next level escalation, i suppose!  Unexpected, and the element of surprise is debilitating. / []
What's disgusting is all the other people that know this is happening..from housekeepers to other  employees, aquantences etc etc... it's American society that sick & corrupted, and it's in decline... / []
they totally unalived her for this SMH poor thing RIP / []
and what about school? she was 16. and did her parents think it was normal for her to be flying all over the place? why didn't they bring her home/ / ['Power dynamics.']
The interviewer is not educated as to the reflex of losing power manifests once a girl has been molested!!  Her questions are clumsy at this point. Her abuse started at 7 years old!!!  Painful to listen. / []
Wake up people who are you going to protect?! Monster's or victims..... love and light to the ones who had to endure this sick abuse. Truth will always prevail 🙏 / []
Hmmm, the pipe bomb chick incident and miss Nancy Pelosi not seeking re-election or resigning sends my spidy sense off. If miss Nancy is exiting stage left, will or can she be held accountable? She has already been implicated by her own words in the J 6 debacle. / []
My god. She died with no justice. RELEASE THE FILES. / []
If baby was a real objective - that sick "couple" would not take too long to find a surrogate. And there are no known children of with Jeffrey or Maxwell. / []
Were they trafficking babies too? I don't buy that they wanted a baby to have a baby. / []
I don't know about you but this doesn't sound like someone who would unalive herself, though it has been years since this interview. / ['She sounds strong and confident. This woman was murdered. 😢']
This is horrific. RIP ❤ / []
She's amazing!! / []
So sad !! Very brave lady !!!  Very well spoken !!! / ['I believe every single word this woman said. I wish I could tell her how proud I am of her and how much I love her even though I’m a complete stranger. 😢❤❤❤❤']
What a brave woman! I have so much respect for and she touch my heart, wish I could have save her. / []
Were you forced?  Or were you there for the cash?  Could you have said NO? / ['It looks so impossible to get out or say no especially if you’re still a child and powerless and has history of abuse at an earlier age. Would they have listened if she said no? I am surprised that it sounds like you blame her not the perpetrators 😑. Blaming the victim is retraumatizing them again and again. Wow people are so sick.']
Thanks! / []
R.I.P / []
She went willingly / []
I believe her. God is not mocked. The guilty will pay. 😢 / []
This is heartwrenching to watch. The sadness in her eyes reflrcts a wounded soul. No one should have to be used like this. No one! / ['The truth is in her eyes. 😢 I wish I could have been there for her. 😢']
How many of you think she was suicidal after watching this interview? / []
Poor child!! This just horrible and all them need to be arrested. / []
Virginia couldn't come up with a word to describe how Maxwell & Epstein procured young girls. The word for Maxwell & Epstein she was floundering for is PREDATORS,  they were both PREDATORS. / []
Makes you wonder if she really committed suicide. She’s been deeply hurt she’s actually a very strong person here. I reckon they murdered her to keep her quiet. / []
Trump should pay for this, but there's no justice anymore in the United States. He's going to die of old age and get off scot free, while leaving the country in permanent decline. / []
No wonder some are pro life, that's where their politicians get their feed.  Disgraceful!   These are the people that should be imprisoned.  You deserve the best life going forward. Keep exposing them! / ['She unalived , they say of su*cide.']
Why didn't she ever disclose  that she settled with ex prince Andrew for ~12 million dollars. But her death in far from suicide. She had a lot of money and new life in 🦘-land. / []
The rich must be brought under control by goverrnment statute and real policeing. / []
She was KILLED by a foreign government. Shame on Australia for not doing anything. / []
She stood by her "court documents" but wouldn't name names when she could. And apparently the court won't release anything. This has bs written all over it. She should have known that her life was more endangered with her list of names being kept in secret. Why didn't the interviewer ask why she just didn't leave? / ['If you servicing bigwigs, is there really a way out? You know too much.']
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 / []
Good thing ugly ppl dont have to go through this. / []
She was nothing but a grifter. Following the money. When Epstien money ended.  She just turn the direction of where the money was. That was becoming a victim. She made plenty of money. I have never seen her as genuine. I do see her story telling. It's a grifters game she was playing. / ['You’re sick in the head and heartless.  What made you into a sociopath? You still have time to connect your spirit back to your soul before you die and are held accountable.']
This is horrific on so many levels but…the fact that Jeffrey required that much physical contact daily is hard to comprehend.  When did he do any actual work or anything else?  This was an absolute addiction. / []
This makes me cry. I’m so sorry for what she had to endure in her life.    When she got in a bus accident and then people started questioning her story, I wish I would have found her social media and said nice things to her… I’d thought about it but then I thought I’m just one person and she doesn’t know me… and then she was d**d!!! I know it might not have made much a difference from a stranger (especially if she didn’t k*ll herself) but the next time I have a feeling to do something like that, I’m going to listen. I hope lots of other people were sending her loving supportive messages 💜 I wish I’d been one of them because she deserved all the love from everyone who felt for her, even strangers.    These people were predators of the vulnerable ~ they sought out people who were from lower financial status as well… I’m wondering if there was a racial predation as well.  Did they prey upon and traffic any Jewish girls or just “Goyim”? / []
One wonders why you didnt learn the first time and still continued to go along on these jaunts. / ['Do you think she’d easily leave or they’d let her go?', "She was being SA'ed at home too. They pick young, already abused victims that have no one else to turn to, and that are already beaten down."]

Thank you for speaking up Miss, RIP 🙏 / []
Are any other women coming forward to say they were victims of Epstein?  With, apparently, so many involved you would think there would be a few more women coming forward to tell their stories. / []
This poor girl and her family will never be the same ever none of them will be that's what abuse does to you. Bless them / []
I still to this day don't understand how her parents did nothing. / []
Now we know how Diana felt too. / []
Wow!! Giuffre pursued criminal and civil actions against Epstein and Maxwell while appealing directly to the public for justice and awareness.[8] She sued Maxwell for defamation in 2015; the case was settled in Giuffre's favor in 2017 for an undisclosed sum.[9] On July 2, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of documents from Giuffre's civil suit against Maxwell.[10] The first batch of documents was released on August 9, 2019,[11] further implicating Epstein, Maxwell, and their associates. The following day, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell.[12] Her husband was also abusive of her and she was fighting for custody of her children (she had 3 with her ex husband) Robert accused Virginia of breaching a family violence restraining order in February and a court hearing was set.[134] For several months afterward, she was prevented from seeing her children.  This is all so tragic / []
God and karma aren’t real. Prove me wrong. 😑 / ['I don’t believe in karma but I do know there is a Creator and life after life and that there will be justice there. Unfortunately, the spiritual is experiential and that’s why it can’t be “proven” in the scientific sense. Example ~like how you can love someone but how can you “prove it” to them (if they have a low self esteem/aren’t trusting)… Love isn’t a scientific thing that can be proven and yet it exists… The good news is~ even those who don’t “believe” in Creator are loved by Creator and will experientially know for sure when they’ve passed to the other side', '@juneelle370 I can appreciate that perspective, it’s true that a lot of what people experience spiritually can’t really be measured or proven in a scientific way. From my point of view though, I think humans naturally search for meaning and patterns, and that can lead to beliefs that feel real even if they aren’t verifiable. I’m not against the idea of something greater existing, I think it would be a relief. But for now, I just think we can only understand what’s observable for now, and the rest stays in the realm of possibility.', '@BritBee-v7g8xfor me I know… but it’s because I’ve literally had intuitions/ messages (premonitions but I prefer the word messages) that have come true … things I couldn’t have known… when I left religion and became atheist (bc I didn’t know a 3rd way) atheists would discount everything as unprovable/anecdotal… but then I finally realized wait, I KNOW it’s true! Who cares if I can’t “prove” to someone else. Also, I don’t think I’m “better” bc of these personal proofs but I am grateful. I was atheist for a while and they hadn’t had these experiences so how could they know. I felt connected from young but mixed in w the connection was evidence… and they help when moments of doubt come… because I’ve seen proof first hand… without any way to prove to others.I wish that for everyone 🌼 I’m not religious or new age… just know we’re all connected.  After atheism I was seeking answers big time and God finally told me this~ and this helped me end my seeking “God is Love & Mystery.” and that people developed religion for control and because they can’t stand the “I don’t know”  I pray you find you experience your own personal evidence but it’s all ok no matter what! You are loved & eternal 💜 \nEven though my life hasn’t been easy and still isn’t ~ I know my life, your life, all our lives are meaningful!!!\n\nEdit~ spelling :)']
R.I.P Virginia 😢... They did it! My Lord Jesus Christ will bring Justice for you and your memory 🙏😢n / []
I cant believe she wanted the massaj terapist certificate that bad / []
Andrés Pastrana Ex-president of Colombia was on that plan. ALONG with Bill Clinton / []
Don’t stop there find the grooming gangs in the west. Girls also prepubescent boys. / []
I wonder did this girl ever say no to Epstein?  Did her parents ever question her or know where she was?  I don’t understand how this happened? I notice that she has never spoken anything negative about Trump. / []
I fear Trump has a LOT of practice making bad things seem normal. TRUMP is trying to normalize...probably this and also killing people.  He is picking men who need a group...who need to feel worthwhile and powerful and who will do whatever at all no matter what and now he can pardon most of their federal crimes and maybe blackmail, who knows,  of State officials if he can then bargain for what he wants...He has experience with this, a teacher like Epstein???   I think this is REAL..The country, men, women, and children are AT RISK.   So very much at risk.   Is that not obvious?   He learned to control...   Putin and other people must have forms of his--dictators. / []
Hello 60 minutes????? Couldn't be bothered to ask the two most important questions????  1) What happened when you asked - anyone - for help? 2) Did ANYONE ever try to help? Ask if you were ok, being abused (hello parents?); anything?   Oops. / []
You had spirits everywhere on everybody but they end up doing is they leave with open portal on you and that portal is is there a connection to you it doesn't matter where you're at and in the spirit they can siphon your energy all the time they can project on you and give you bad energy back you have to rebuke it with the blood of Jesus / []
Demonic and only god can help this pmease pray to jesus for help with deliverance of demons / []
Whether the Epstein files are ever released, God knows all the names and what they did. There will be consrquences! / []
Im blaming her father for not protecting her. He left her in strangers house?! / []
What was going on there was you guys were there as the marks or the guests of honor or of just party guests that they were marking for specific demons to be able to siphon your energy through the open portals that they have on you that was a demon energy harvesting Fest they are known for sex trafficking they are known for molesting young children they are known for siphoning children's Divine energy a Living Sacrifice the Nations do it the Eastern stars do it you know what I mean it's an elite thingThe Nations do it the Eastern stars do it you know what I mean it's an elite thing it's disgusting but Very real and if you see in the spirit you would know what I'm talking about take a look at everything exception to the faces you know what I mean the faces have marks on them the next have marks on them everybody in their has marks look at it / []
I'm telling you right now they were marking every single one of you siphon Your Divine energy they were siphoning your life force and you didn't even know it and they can continue doing it because you had an open portal with a demon that you needed delivered every single one of you have marks on you from demons take a look at her skirt take a look at the evil spirits in that each and every Square take a look at Epstein's hands take a look at how weird they look Zoom all the way in and take a gander need I say more / []
Her dad sounds like a real dead beat... cuz what father allows his underage daughter to go to a job interview alone, at night, into someone's mansion house, and also agrees that they'll be responsible for driving her home? ESPECIALLY, if it's a man interested in hiring her to be his own personal traveling masseuse, I MEAN, COME ON!!! THAT was a dad who didn't give a shhh about his daughter. Any adult, especially, a father, would know damn well how inappropriate that sounds! If the father cared and had half a brain, he would have immediate red flags going off... but then again, both of her parents were clearly not there for her to begin with. / []
I will probably  get hate for this, but where are the other names? All need to be brought to account! / []
Wow what a brave and powerfully truthful woman / []
😢 / []
Take a look at those photographs right there you zoom in on it I saw several demons in the flesh in between the dark spots and the white spots in the contrast zoom in you can also see everybody's skin there has got marks on it red marks all of them in the letters almost like they're being branded pure evil that I saw four different demons in that in that crowd right there in between I saw the word evil in the weird lettering in Epstein's head in his hair now I'm not one to 345 on the clock by the way actually 435 is the time but you know signs and synchronicities of it there is evil all over that room you can see it on everybody's face you can see it in the demons there's demons in the flesh right there in people's hair on their skin all over the place take a gander take a gander a little bit closer and you know you might want to throw some maybe some contrast filters on those things too and see what else you see I can see these spirits in the in the in the now you know the Native Americans used to think that photographs would take your soul a little piece of your soul and if you notice older photographs have the color of the eyes they also have the red part in there a lot of folks believe that red part is a level of evilness all got the the equilibrium of good versus evil all growing up they took that away from us too to get out of every cartoon made it a miserable thing for everybody can't even have cartoons anymore voice Satan has had a real run of of this Earth and his children God's children Divine Child of God poor woman I hate hearing things like this cuz it disgusts me and I know exactly what this person is going through because on all too much of a real level of it a lot of people have had at least somebody abused in your family or IE abused yourself it's ridiculous that nobody does anything about this kind of stuff they don't really look into it very deep knowing that this is pure satanic s*** yes it is God God hears you God knows these people need help they need help big time / []
A young girl who sold herself is playing the victim. She made millions from this. / ['Do you even hear yourself???? A young girl can\'t "sell herself". That\'s called someone taking advantage of a young girl and abusing her.']
Omg, that is me.😢 / []
If you expose the rich they will get you, it's a warning to shut up!  So much is kept under the carpet, only the brave stand up ❤ / []
It is so sad that she is not here today and I hope that eventually justice is served.  These discussing animals need to be held accountable. / ['Who?  How do you know she is telling the truth?']
I believe every word coming out of this lady’s mouth! They need to release the Epstein list. We / the world has the right to know who these predators are and what they did! Trumps keeping the republicans  from doing the right thing. Well the republicans that do have a little soul and normalcy in their hearts. / ['The whole story by this woman is made up BS.']
That poor girl and after all that instead of leaving her alone free of them ... ugh! / []
Trump has signed a deal to commute Ghislaine Maxwell's sentence and set her FREE. Release the files. Justice for the victims. / ['I bet Maxwell has been more truthful than Giuffre.', '@willmont8258 Maxwell was convicted on PERJURY charges, troll.']
This is hard to watch. What’s infuriating is that we have a President who not only was Epstein’s best friend for over a decade, but now contemplates pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell. This is unreal! / []
Who were the other men besides andrew / ['There was no one, not even Andrew.']
✨🕯️🪷💫✨ I respect your courage and grit. 💪💪 you’re standing fast against ego-maniacal energies.🫡 🌹 It must be seen, this has to end.  Blessings to you - and may you know safety and peace always. 🐦‍🔥🦋✨ / []
I wonder if they ever made an investigation with the police department, what the heck the investigation should go in many directions / []
Made me cry just like when I watched Jane does video of the assault Trump Epstein done to her at age 13 she brought a law suit against Trump in 2016 but drop it because of all the threats all them girls went through hell / ['She dropped it because it was all BS.']
Killed by the abusers / []
Well you got some Justice. Randy Andy's no longer a prince. He got stripped of all his titles. God bless King Charles / []
I pray every day for the victims to be heard and the truth to be revealed. I thought it would happen by now... but one day they WILL ALL stand before God and be accountable. / []
release the Epstein files. / []
Predators are always responsible for how they treat their victims. End of story. It doesn’t matter why victims get Stockholm syndrome or any other participation in the cycle of abuse… Predators are always responsible for what they do. / []
She describes Complex PTSD symptoms! Such trauma! / []
Her book was eyeopening and amazing. Very easy to read and well written. ❤ / ['And not true.']
The interviewer is so cold and accusatory in her tone / []
May God grant you the peace and healing you deserved in this life. / []
That poor girl.Just horrific / []
Coming from a family where all my relatives are masons and eastern stars - I suspect Virginia's family are masons and they sold her out.  Seriously, think about it.  Her father works for Trump?  You don't get a job with Donny Boy unless you are a mason.  'Just ask all those masons who built the Trump skyscrapers in NYC and elsewhere.  Virginia's parents turning a "blind eye" to her predicament is the BIG RED FLAG. / []
What an incredible story. Thank you for your strength to share your story. Many many young women out there that were in your shoes will definitely benefit of it.   May you rest in peace. Amen. / []
My condolances🙏😓⚘ / []
I m sorry and appologize if I dont understand or misunderstanding , wasnt it young womens choice to be on that and get payed from powerfull persons? Isnt it kind of axept , bcs they payed, didnt they? Was it violence ? It was also up to young women to do or not what mothers told not to do or they didnt knew whats komming ? 😢 / []
😢 Brave woman -- may justice come out at the end. / []
Gislaine & Jeffrey 0 conscience. / []
Vote in 218 in office for these monsters it sad what happening here. / []
Well she certainly loved the lavish lifestyle and Epstein's money. / []
Where were her parents? / []
This should be playing everywhere / []
I am 66 year old male, I know what it's like to be sexual abused. I was at a very young age, even before puberty, its was every night for 5 years. U don't understand what is happening to U, When U do and tell people what is going on, NO ONE BELIEVES U.  That is why U shut up in the in, because NO ONE BELIEVES U. I some how survived it, and lived as normal life as I could, but it always stays with me even to this day, I did seek help later in life only to be told by professional people, I CAN'T HELP U. So people that is what its like and what people like me think is what did I do to have this happen to me, and its US  the victims that think this. Problem is People, U HAVE TO HAVE PROOF Solid proof, as U accuse someone, they will of course DENIE DENIE DENIE. / []
How could Trump wish Guillaine well wishes ?!!!! / []
sorry, but this interviewer is a predator too / []
Gen pups her dad drop her off at a strangers house for a hike “interview” HOW STUPID!!! I would not even think to drop my kid off with a stranger . I’d be there in the house in the next room waiting and listening . / []
Is like she’s been a magnet to abusers / []
After watching this interview i am convinced they had her KILLED! She was smart she knew she was in danger. / []
Its interesting isnt it. Lady Di, Epstein, Virginia Dufriess all died mysteriously? The British secrect service are a very resourceful entity. I wonder if they could shed any light on these deaths? 🤔 / []
May she rest in peace. What a brave soul. / []
I believe her very word How courageous to speak up Pure greatness / []
the biggest question never asked..who took over operations? these criminals didn't just stop screwing as their desire never dies / ['FBI was first on the scene at kiddie diddler island..just sayin!!', 'There are multiple rings. Diddy is one of them and they are letting him off easy just like they did with Epstein in 2009 after he was first arrested for trafficking. History repeating itself but with Diddy this time and no one seems to care. : /']
I don’t believe she took her own life. She was going to expose a lot of important and wealthy people. I think they killed her. / []
Her Father was her first abuser as she states in her memoir....he took money from Epstein. Absolutely tragic and disgusting. She never had a chance and was failed by literally everyone. RIP.  I'm glad she's finally at peace now. / []
I think she thought the abuse defined her and thought that she was less than because someone did something to her / []
We as a society need to protect our women and children. There are despicable people running around doing heinous acts without consequences. / []
This is horrific.  This poor girl.   She was a child.  Maxwell should be in maximum security prison and even that is too good for her.  The men involved need to be revealed and these men prosecuted. / ['The whole story is BS, and you fell for it.']
This is crazy / []
They "suicided her" so she couldn't come forward with further names! / []
Die Interviewerin ist eine reine Katastrophe! Wie kalt die ist! Sogar vorwurfsvoll: und Du hast ihnen vertraut? Gibt es Beweise? Hast Du Namen?  Widerlich.   Mein Gott, Sieh doch hin, hör ihr zu! / []
Rest in Peace Virginia 💔 / []
This is so horrible to know. / []
The million dollar question is why did her father leave here there. And what did he know about the gossip surrounding these 2 before he drove her there! / []
Anyone that participated should serve time and have to be on the registry. Anyone who knew but looked the other way is just as responsible. Everything you put out in the world will come back to you one thousandfold. I hope every single person that was involved even tangentially should receive punishment that mirrors their culpability. As long as you do the right thing, don’t ever be afraid of saying it. / []
Poor innocent little girl. "Well, I'm going to be abused either way. I might as well get paid for it! $200.  Those people are so unconscious themselves. They are clueless that we're talking about an adolescent who has no understanding of what's happening. Their brain isn't even fully developed, and you're talking to her as if she understands. It's such madness.  They may be aware on one level. But they are certainly insane. Needing deep therapy themselves. / []
Continue to rest in peace my dear sister. I pray for justice for all the young children that were molested ,traffic, traumatized by PEDIFILES and CHILD MOLESTORS. / []
And we're to believe that she committed suicide. If her husband would speak out and tell the truth about what happened, and how they've tried to threaten him and their children into silence, I'd be very interested to see how it played out. But, as it is now, evil wins again. How is this not being shouted from the rooftops? How has the world already forgotten Virginia? / []
How evil , revolting and shameless a “human” can be?  Poor soul. So much trauma… and such a sad and tragic end. / []
In the photo of Naomi Campbells birthday Virginia loves oks around 9 yrs of age. Why would she be at this party? Second she looks too young to hv been employed at Maralogo. Can anyone explain this? / []
Big time madam .Jy bhawani / []
RIP Virginia... millions of us believe you. / ['And those millions are being duped.']
separately, the interview audio is quite low and compared to the ads it's jarring, please fix. / []
How very sad her life's been. Abused since she was 7yrs old and it never stopped. Those baby trafficking rogues should be locked up, / []
😢 Brave Virginia RIP / []
This is was one tough doc to get through. I can't imagine the strength and courage it took go public. The injustice makes me sick. 🤮😠 / ["Make up a story about being abused by wealthy men, and then sue for $$$$$.  Doesn't take much courage to do that."]
Her hubby put her up to suing people. She got well paid, should have lived out her life happy, in Australia / []
Ok let’s expose Trump because he was the Jeffrey Epstein partner in crime!!! Not Gislaine, she is the fall guy! / []
Very typical of child sexual abuse victims.  It starts with one abuser. Then you are somehow “marked” and it becomes a pattern / []
May her speaking her truth not be in vain in the end, may God bless the legacy of this woman. / []
Wow / []
You are a legend Tara! / []
There R good and Evil people in every culture of life / []
Thank you Virgina. RIP sweetheart. / []
She did not alive herself. / []
Terrible- so much EVIL / []
Thank you for leaving a book Virginia. We know you didn't unanalive yourself / []
Kids rarely tell their parents about sexual abuse. Sometimes not for decades after it happens. / []
I don't believe it was just men I bet women were involved too. / []
Justice for Virginia 💔 / []
Why were you there? It makes no sense. / []
How were you brought UP? / []
My mother was done like this in NEW YORK CITY.  BROOKLYN. ANGEL GUARDIAN HOME. 1944 -1955 / []
SHE DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE!!!!!! / []
Don't forget Trump is stil alive / []
Why did  your mom allow you to go to a place like that? Quite frankly, it s such a difficult situation  to understand .Why did your mother allow you to disappear with strangers? / []
u couldn't tell because u liked that :))) / []
Poor thing. Her self esteem was so low. Its awful how we raise our girls to be "nice"all the time with nothing but a polite  smile as a tool to go out in the real world. Doesn't take an epstien level wealth to manipulate a girl like that. / []
I wouldn't be surprised if Trump had told Epstein and Ghislene about Virginia working at Mar-a-Lago or he at least knew that she was ear-marked for Epstein / []
I feel sorry for VIRGINA , but she could have walked away ,she obviously enjoyed the high life .., god bless 🇬🇧 / ['A disgusted comment. People with your mentality are the enablers of this system without accountability.']
she needs to name the people on this video and it be broadcast on the main news worldwide! Whats bizarre is why didn't she just say the names to get them arrested, Evil disgusting people all of them are complicit. He's not dead. / []
I wish you the best.  I bought your book.  Such a sickening story.   Who made her parents into devils. / []
Did she ever mention what her parents were thinking or did they question her travels all over the world? / []
"as a mom" so how did the kid get there? :DD omg 🤦‍♂ / []
She was so pretty / []
Now, read or listen to Trance formation of America by  Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips and realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes / []
So sad. / []
Queen warned of "Dark forces" as Princess Diana died at hands of gutter press of Australian Royal family hater, Rupert Murdoch. Robert Maxwell died in dark circumstances so did Epstein and looks like Virginia Guffrie knew too much about Murdoch too. The story will tirn but not in Prince Andew's direction. The real story is coming out about those Australian champaign Marxist Republicans. / []
How can these reporters not bust out crying these people seem evil too just casually asking questions because even if you dont believe her its still a sad story to hear / []

We dont need the epstein files. We have the testimony of the women who were trafficked. I dont understand why everyone wants the files. We have the actual word of the victims! / ['Because you need names to bring to the shining light', "You have stories by some which are not credible.  Giuffre's are the biggest examples of stories which are made up and preposterous."]
Shame, and the way she’s advocating for her younger self - almost still trying to convince herself that it wasn’t right - after all the brainwashing. There is a part of herself that thinks it was her fault or that she deserved it. / []
Rest in peace knowing P. Andrew has been shamed and ousted from the royal family. / []
Invisible chains. Unfortunately so many of us are carrying them around / []
I stayed in a relationship for 4 years after wanting to leave after only 3 months. I was a teenager.   I understand this mindset. Healthy people perhaps can’t understand how this is possible, but it is. So it looks like the victim chooses but they don’t realise that they can make another choice.   Her parents are to blame!!!!!!!!!! / []
This makes sense how Trump got in office.  Grooming to the highest levels.  And it's been happening since the 80's. / ["There may be laws against trafficking, but that doesn't mean how they will be enforced.  Like all laws are seemingly more of a false sense of security than actually against what they say.  I can think of so many examples."]
Who actually has the Epstein files that everyone talks about ? Are these just names because the president would just say it’s fake news. He obviously is involved so no one will ever release anything for that reason. / []
What people don't tell you about abuse is that it perpetuates more abuse by eroding your sense of worthiness and sense of self. The idea that someone would want to maliciously hurt you or even enjoy hurting you makes one feel like there must be something wrong with you that would justify that abuse. Especially when it happens as a child. And it makes you more vulnerable for the rest of your life because you feel so alone in your experience. / []

I'm absolutely amazed that she didn't end up hating all men, or even all people, after practically every person she encountered turned out to be a raging beast out to use her. That's probably why she especially liked animals. They might be "beasts" but none of them act as depraved as humans. / ["Animals don't lie, but she did."]
I don’t like the interviewers vibe. I see no empathy in her eyes or hear it in her voice. / []
Thank you for your story 💞🙏 / ["You're very welcome, we appreciate you watching."]
She truly got what she bartered for.  So she could get money.  So Sadd.  I feel for her.  And also say she is partly very responsible.   She could have stopped it.  But she liked the attention. / []

I'm thankful to my parents protecting me. My friends parents weren't naive but neglectful"]

I'm having an emotional breakdown listening to this video. I had to take a pause and come back because she deserves to be heard by the masses, me included. / []
I really have huge doubts she killed herself. I'm very sorry for her and her family and all the other victims..the fact that maxwell ist in a nice prison proofs all of Virginias points / []
The vulture Epstein is dead and Virginia , too. I dont think that is a coincidence and I am not even into conspiracy theories, its just very obvious . What a waste of life , unbelievable injustice. / []
🙏✨️💕 / []
RIP Virginia. Thank you for your courage and bravery. Release the Epstein files!!!! / []
Gee, and guess what?  Jean-Luc Brunel was also found dead in a prison in France, supposedly by his own hanging.  Isn't that strange!  Not really as it seems someone or someones have the ability to get rid of the people that know and could be witnesses to this horror!  Twenty two people it is said have died under mysterious circumstances and are connected to Epstein, including Epstein himself.  You have to wonder who is pulling the strings!  I have an idea ... but I would not want to say the name! / []
they should all be named shamed and sent to jail / []
such a powerful testimony, I'm so thankful she's come forward. this system needs changed / []
She is so beautiful .. she did not deserve any of this.💔 / []
She didn't kill herself. No way. She was definitely murdered by the US Government. / ['That is a lie as big as the ones told by Giuffre.']
Absolutely insane how everyone knows this shit needs to hit the fan NOW but we are all being distracted and controlled to ignore it.  She and so many others deserve their justice. So sick. / []
Who killed her? / ['Herself.']
And the kill here Like Epstein! And were? Cia, goverment !!!! / []
Wow. Mandatory reporters said nothing 😢 / []
22:34  you were cheap.   And you should have been ashamed ! / []
0:05 RIP VIRGINA❤ / []
22:22 well why didn’t you tell your employers you demand more money! And to see the world and rub shoulders with elites….. she got paid at all and still claims to be a victim.  It wasn’t like she was growing poor in a trailer park. / []
This is disturbing. Maxwell is just a predator. She needs to be put back into a higher level prison. She needs to serve her sentence! / []
Controlled release. Let it happen. Know there's more. / []
Anyone who's never encountered SA will never understand or question how Virginia still stuck around that gang. Hugs to your soul Virginia and anyone else still fighting and questioning themselves. / []
Everyone involved in this sex trafficking rings needs prison for life / []
Trump will shed light on all of this. The democrats crimes will not go unpunished🤬 / []
She was a beautiful young lady. May she RIP! / []
God bless this woman. / []

Sad hearing this after her passing. I pray she’s at peace now and those who harmed her will get what they deserve maybe not here but in the afterlife. / []
THE LORDDS: SEX IS EVERYWHERE MADAM...EVERYWHERE! BUT DID ALL COME THERE FOR SEX?! NO.  EPSTIEN WAS KILLED FOR NO REASON. ALL WHO WANTED TO BE THERE..WERE THERE. NONE FORCED. THERE IS NO EPSTIEN FILES... / []
What’s frustrating is that these victims are still ashamed of the abuse and blame themselves because they still protect the abusers by not naming them.  By naming the abusers they get to release the truth and they just can’t do it.  I wish they would come to programs like these and point  the finger and name the names of the guilty party so we can show the support and so the law and or the public  can shame these abusers. But they come out and don’t name anyone so we the public get numb and don’t pay much attention. It’s a shame really. / []
You gave up / []
I feel so profoundly for this woman. I wish she could have met a decent man or woman in her life to have made her happy and take away the pain of her childhood and adulthood. Alas she was not granted that. / []
May her soul rest in peace / []
Once her parents abandoned and gave  up on her she must have been hopelessly sad and alone. / []
Seems like the anchor is judging her, just look at her expressions ! its not sympathy but judgement and disgust. I hope I am wrong ! but seriously looking at this anchor's face is making me uncomfortable. / []
😢 RIP / []
I never believe this strong woman has put an end to her life. She mentioned that she overcame the urge to commit suicide. She is self-composed, compassionate, frank, outspoken, and a woman with a mission. Her life was gruesomely hard and harsh, but she survived to warn and to bring a message of hope and survival to many traumatized women. I do believe she has been murdered because she knows much. Poor soul. I pray she is now surrounded by angels. / []
Very sad / []
Why didn't she leave? Why didn't she drop more names? / []
I cried listening to Virginia. I am just soo sad to hear she had taken her own life.She deserve to have the truth.Such a brave young woman. Rest in peace Virginia. The only difference between you and the people you were associated with is that they have money. They are no more important to this world than you are. i have always truly believed in all my life. / []
She was right … not just the powerful abusers are guilty of this monstrous criminal activity, but also everyone who witnessed the abuse committed against these young girls … from royalty, politicians, authorities, hospital officials, doctors, dentist, maids, drivers, etc., they are all guilty of complicity for turning a blind eye and not reporting these atrocious evil crimes. Shameful that the world has so many of these rich and powerful cowards going through life committing such abuse while pretending to be the most righteous and decent individuals of society. They are actually the complete opposite… evil, sick and filthy scums is what best describes them. Unfortunately, the rich and powerful are oftentimes the epitome of corruption and human depravation. / []

tRump knew her back story too, he had actually met her before this happened and he knew her dad, so DT knew exactly where this young woman was working in the Mara-Lago complex. How else do you think Ghislaine Maxwell knew where to go find her? He sold her out. Think about it!! / []
Why did he have 50-60 teddy bears on his bed?  Well, actually it turns out there were 72...  ....because more of them have come forward. 😂🤣😅 / []

Pedophilia crimes should be treated as seriously as murder crimes. From evidence the victims lives are effectively over from that point on and they are never mentally, physically or emotionally well ever again. As if they had been unalived effectively. And why is it not treated as seriously? That’s the question to ask yourself 🤢🤮😔 / []

It's about all the men that was involved in it.He wasn't the only one my god wake up people✌️🙏🙏❤️❤️🍁🍁 / []
Mental abuse is criminal too / []
It would have been great if Virginia (RIP) left a Deadman's switch upon her untimely death. To include information that could be verified and tied to names of those hiding in the shadows now. That would break this whole debacle wide open. / []
Thank you Virginia. May you rest in perfect peace. / []
Pedophiles have more power now then the victims and that is the sad part / []
They murdered her. / []
So, Virginia says she was trafficked at Naomi Campbell's birthday party, and the interviewer does not ask to 'WHO'?  Virginia says that Epstein trafficked her to someone that was physically abusive to punish her. And the interviewer does not ask to 'WHO'?  What is it with these victims and not naming names? Because, until you are ready to hold these people accountable, this is just an interesting fiction.  ******* To be honest, my faith in my government, and the humanity of the people who take jobs in law enforcement has been completely destroyed by the Epstein case. Here we have multiple witnesses and evidence - the girls trafficked, the men and women who abused them, Epstein's support staff, pilots and more - hundreds or thousands of witnesses plus video evidence. And yet, the FBI is sitting on their hands, burying and perhaps destroying evidence to cover the elite who are involved. I cannot tell you how this enrages me.  And this does not simply implicate republicans, or Trump. Biden had a chance to prosecute it and didn't. Trump 45 had a chance and didn't. Obama didn't. Bush didn't. Clinton not only didn't, but was getting head in the white house. As an aside, what kind of woman would blow a married guy in the white house? We are always making this about men, but Monika was not trafficked - she was there of her own will. But I digress....  This is a very sad and sordid story made even worse by the duplicity and moral bankruptcy of our government and everyone who is keeping their mouth shut over what they know to be true about the blackness of people who work there. You should all be very ashamed to look in the mirror every day. / []

Most wealthy people think they are above the law and to some degree they are; so it’s easy for them to abuse innocent young girls. What a dark disgusting world. May justice prevail for her and all sexually abused children/young girls. Release the Epstein files; the law should be for everyone. One day they will have to give an account and if not here; when they meet their maker. / []
It breaks my heart that she didn’t speak more about the family member who abused her for four years, starting when she was just seven. I’m now going through the process of speaking up about the person who abused someone close to me as a child and facing judgment from family members for bringing it up after so many years. I cannot comprehend why she was able to speak out and seek justice against those who harmed her as a teenager—people like Epstein and Maxwell —yet did not address further the abuse from a family member who had such a profound impact on her life. Why? All people who abused are evil. / []
How can people be this sick 😭 my heart breaks / []
Look at how Naomi is looking at her in that picture she knew / []
Instead of making comments about Mary, maybe the pope should be addressing the pictures of the previous Pope w Epstein / []

My best friend as a child was born into terrible circumstances. Her dad was violent, her mom an enabler, her uncle started SA'en her when she was about 12, and so much more. We went to the same kindergarten, and that how we became friends. My upbringing was much different. What was the wildest thing about her is, how that upbringing made her seemingly naive and completely blind to suspicious people. It like those assholes destroyed her ability to read people, and her hunger for love and affection really did make her the 'perfect' victim for evil people. I knew her all her life, always tried to help her, but it felt like an impossible task. She lived with me and my mom once, when she ran away from a school where she had been raped. Tried to get her away from her family. And then she ran back. I dont blame her for one second. She made one bad choice after another, but only because no one ever taught her to how to make good choices. Tragically she died of ALS at 35 (2018). I think of her all the time and it makes me so angry, when people ask victims any kind of "but why didn't you just..." No one is subjected to these things volunteeringly. No one. Period. Blame the abusers, only! / []
I will never understand how these rich and/or powerful men expect that such an „operation“ is not about blackmailing only.  Not that there are more moral reasons to not be involved, but not even that minimum of self defense. / []
Virginia, your light will shine forever. I will keep on fighting in your names for that there will be justice and true change. I don’t have the right words to express how thankful I am for you and how unfair, cruel and shattering your life has been. Life, humanity and this world didn’t deserve you. You deserve the whole universe. I know that you are free and loved. May you rest in power, freedom and happiness. ✊🏼🤍💫 / []
Didn't they have her murdered? It doesn't make sense that she would kill herself, she was on a mission! Release the Epstein Files! Investigate the Epstein investigation! / []

What I can't understand is how her father could take her to Epstein's horror house. He knew exactly what was happening up there. But then again he too abused Virginia when she was just a child. According to her words. I tend to believe rape victims. She said her father let his friend abuse her as well. That poor child had been sexually abused and trafficed since she was seven. 😢🙏💙 / []

Come on 60 minutes. Show us Aussies true investigative journalism and look into Virginia’s death. Guaranteed she was murdered.

She was of legal age looking for adventure sad but true / []
I don't understand if u hate it and find it disgusting why would u carry on just for a certificate? The look on your parents face would be enough to break u. Plus why couldn't her parents step in and rescue her? Parents can always see through their child and know something isn't right. / []
Aww Virginia I really hope ur still here safe in another country leading ur life as u see fit I truly do ….. my heart is always thinking of you I’ve been through stuff in my life it’s certainly not easy but I don’t believe u took ur life no way ….

I personally would have put on a panic attack and run. There are many ways of getting away  than complying with something that would scar u forever. If I saw a naked man that id have to massage I'd run a mile. Alarm bells would go off. I would never think this is how massage therapy is. / []
I find it amazing she was at maralargo and suprise here come gelaine . There must be a link with that place and traffickers / []
I can't believe the parents are so thick enough to dump their daughter to unvetted people. And why wouldn't she even think of doing her course through a college properly. / []
It’s so obvious that Trump was involved. That disgusting orange clown. I can relate to everything she went through unfortunately. I was a bused multiple times by people in power. The cycle 🔁 of abuse for vulnerable women is real and almost impossible to break when those who are doing it have a lot of power and a lot of money. And you’re constantly being blamed. I was gaslighted by so many people including Doctors and psychologists who were supposed to be helping me. You can’t say “therapist” without saying “The R A P I S T” “YOUR the common denominator..It’s YOUR fault.”.. or blaming it on my substance abuse. There are all different kinds of victim blaming and it happens all the time. I will never be the same person after what happened to me but I’m alive. I’m afraid if I name names like she did, then my Mom will get a call that I’ve “unalived” myself. Jefferey Epstein didn’t unalive himself and she didn’t either. Just disgusting. / []

She was 16 and vulnerable!!!! What discernment, courage, and wisdom does a teenager have in such a situation? A situation of promises, threats, intimidation, psychological and physical abuse. Simply diabolical, malicious, evil, disgusting. From all parties involved. All of them! These two Epstein and Girlane are pure evil. And of course that they killed her. Poor soul… I don’t know how she summoned courage to tell but I’m glad she did. The world needs to hear this and most importantly DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. / []

It's obvious that V. is not suicidal.  She was obviously killed.  She spoke out against a prince, there is no way she would be allowed to live.  I've seen tons of movies where the murderer is instructed to make it look self inflicted.   She was clear that she had purpose,  a loving family and despite the trauma,  has settled into a peaceful life.   You should have gone to the court transcripts and scrolled all the names at the end of the interview. / []
Idk why this woman had to become so heavily abused.. where was God? She’s now dead. Why why why. It makes me so mad. These people have no conscious, heart or moral compass just pure evil. / []
her nightmare really started at mar a lago  how did trump and melania not know this was happening ????? / []
She knew exactly what was going on and knew it wasn’t right but did it anyways. What I find peculiar is that she was working at Mar-a Lago as an employee and then got an offer to go work directly for JE? She had already dropped out of high school and/or not required to attend school at the age of 16? Why didn’t her parents put a stop to it? Oh, they were receiving money for their silence. / []
RIP Ms Virginia / []
So heart breaking😢 / []
They were sick people. Epstein would get paid thousands while they pay her $200. 😐 / ['Who paid Epstein?']
her parents should be in jail. who lets their kid go on flights and run around with random adults like this? after everything she went through they couldnt see the red flags and danger? she had a bedroom in his residences? how was this allowed? I bet epstein paid them to keep her, why hasnt she mentioned pushback from her parents on these massage sessions. they were in on it. / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES...Who is being protected ????? / []
That was so heartbreaking to watch. RIP  Virginia❤It makes me incredibly angry that Republicans in Congress want to sweep this under the carpet. How many of them are on the list?? / []

So sad she ended up marrying an EVIL ABUSER. So sad for her. / []
I think it's time for a massive protest to congress demanding that they release these files. Enough is Enough. Ghislaine Maxwell just recently had her appeal rejected by the US Supreme Court. There is no longer any legal reason to not release them. No one is going to tell me  that Trump isn’t on the files. He and Epstein were best buds for over a decade as Epstein said himself. / ['Mike Johnson has been blocking a vote. All Democrats are on board and at least a couple of Republicans.']
I think if we can all just say yes, so-and-so abused me, whether it was your father or your grandfather or your uncle or your neighbor or your brother or your sister, maybe we can make this all end. They abuse is so ubiquitous and so maybe we need to make naming the abusers ubiquitous. Not even to punish them but just to get it out on the open and not hide it anymore. / []
Trafficked ? Loved money. And so did her parents obviously! All knew what she was involved in. Her parents should be charged. If there were all these men I'm sure they didn't know her real age. Why didn't her parents get her out of there and report this. Perhaps she's ashamed of what she did.  Which is understandable of course. Where were the parents.?  Strange ! So very sad 🙏 / []
No way that you can tell me her Father was not aware of J.Ep.... He knew / []
Where were your parents when all this was going on when you were a young girl? Add why didn't you walk when you figured out what was going on the first time? / []

Trump is still covering this up, AND he is featured heavily in the files according to people "in the know". There are more pics of Trump/Epstein partying, than me with my own mother for God's sake! Disgraceful. The Truth about all the influential people involved will come out sooner or later! RIP sweetheart. 🕯 / []
Watching this breaks my heart. Knowing what happened later. May God damn us if we don't find some way to make all the monster pay for their crimes against young girls. / []
She should have put all their names in her book.. / ['Good point …. Must of been many more … but one is targeted .. 🤔']
I totally understand her and believe her 100%.  As someone who has in my past hungout in the wealthy members clubs of London like Tramp, Drama, Annabels, the way these people casually and subtly display their power, it is scary. I remember having gone to a party and the penthouse owner had taken a liking to me. One other guest started suggesting that you should keep him company and if you try to leave, the rich guy will act disappointed. If you’re someone who's a people pleaser and not from that world, you start feeling awful. It's a way to guilt tripping you. Seems like everyone's walking on eggshells and the success of the party depends on the host getting what he wants. You get almost scolded for "not being fun". They do ask questions about yourself, like you're an innocent curiosity. Then they suggest, "would it be fun to fly here or there, have you ever been"? The rich owner always wants to give you a private tour of their penthouse or country house just to be alone with you. They have 0 sense of time. They suggest the wildest thing in a sec, than change their minds the next. It's just ever impossible to know when they are serious or not. You start getting scared because you notice how unstable some of these rich guys are.    I am lucky I was never trafficked and i left the environment very, very fast after I was spiked at Annabels. I called to complain but the club never called responded to my demand for an investigation. The Met police thought I was some drunk girl and didn't get me to A&E for a rape kit and blood test. I had nightmares for weeks after this and found bruises on my body that I couldn't recall.   Everything she said about being lost, exhausted, losing sense of time, being at their mercy, feeling powerless, I absolutely believe it.  She's right about the staff turning a blind eye because the staff sees you, the woman in danger as a rich brat that they envy or just a hooker.  What she also said about Ghislaine being posh and impressive is also something I felt. You feel impressed with these posh women surrounding them. These women are meant to give you a false sense of security, thinking you're not alone with just men and these men act like gentlemen with these women so you think you're part of the posh girl club too. / []
So her DAD recommended the job to her???? Her father put her in that situation knowing who Trump was obviously, if he knew about Mar a lago?? For the love of all things holy. Thats what I gathered from part of this. Your father introduced you to a trafficking ring....wow. / []
Where are all of the children missing since Biden opened the border? forget Epstien, go save the current missing children. / []
The family law court killed her not Epstein or ANDREW. THEY TOOK HER KIDS THE MAIN GROUNDING FACTOR IN HER LIFE. THE TYPICAL FATHER STEALING HER CHILDREN TO GET OUT OF CHILD SUPPORT NO DOUBT.

This is the first time I have seen this interview.  Everything she says here she says in her book except who abused her as a child. That is in the book. She said in her book “if something happens to me it is not by my own hand “. I don’t believe she committed suicide. I also don’t believe Epstein committed suicide, he was too much of a narcissist. / []
Yes I know she ended her life but I had to make my comments in the present tense. / []

Nobody hates to work hard and gain Capital challenge a life and live decent life allproblem arises when cheating and hurting others for the benefit of only self interest hurting others Such an innocent human beings in that  young age is the fruit of Capitalism we should say No as a Humanity this is Compatible with Slavery i am saying No such a Horrible story / []
R.I.P. Virginia Giuffre 😢😢😢 She didn’t deserve the crap that happened to her. I pray she’s now at peace and my thoughts and prayers go out to her family 🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯 / []
Honest question: given she wasn't mentally disabled and had the mental maturity of a young women, why didn't she say no and walk away? She was never held against her will. / []
💔💔💔💔💔 / []
12-year-olds, I can see why Trump and Jeffrey are friends. And seems like there might be some truth to Primary Colors. / []
26:04 shaking hands with the Pope? Benedict? John Paul? Which pope / []
It's never been the same since Trump went "Epstein who?" / []
Release the Epstein files! / []
are you sure Jeffrey is dead / []
So why doesn’t anybody mention any names? / []
Makes me fear for the missing children from the trumpet administration first family separation policy. / []
Justice for this incredibly brave woman!   Release the files!!!!! / []
How could anyone NOT believe her. / []
Mike Johnson needs to return the house to SWEAR ADELITA GRIJALVA IN and force a release on the Epstein Files! / []
Seven !!! Assaulted by a " friend of the family?". How parents could miss the signs? There is Psychologists, Sofial Workers, Teachers...how nobody realized she was crying for help? / ['They were complicit. Probably got paid.', 'It was the dad!']
Monsters killing childhood……her described reaction is called “dissociation”…used to be called a “harem”……probably still is / []
Bless this girl. / ['Jesus protect her.']
Thank you for your amazing bravery in telling this painful story.   It is only by turning the lights on this issue, that it will stop. / []
RIP, beautiful😮😮 / []
Does anybody else feel like Israel isn't our greatest ally??? / []
TRUMP IS GONNA PARDON MAXWELL / []
She explains all the feelings of being sexually abused perfectly, and predictors can tell if someone's been a victim from Mike's away. Good hold you in his hand forever. RIP 😢 / []
Narcissistic smirk! / []
SHE DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE / ['😢😢😢😢', 'Nop…']
She was beautiful and vulnerable and became a toy for sick people to take advantage of. She’s so honest it’s excruciating to listen to . This is such a tragedy because I’m sure this kind of thing is happening right now, somewhere. / []
People honestly don't understand when the SA begins at such a young age it changes who you are, and you try to convince yourself that it is what happens to everyone else because it is all you know.😢😌💔  a toy being passed around isn't the half of it 👿💔 / []
They want her forgotten… someone should do a movie about her… / []
My heart goes out to this beautiful  soul / []
The father sold her. How else does ghislane maxwell take a minor from mar largo and parents don't complain. Victims need to stop protecting pedos .alan dershowitz, harvard professor also abuser that's why he defended epstein. She was murdered like epstein because trump and his friends are involved / []
Bless her heart 💖 to trusting / []
God bless her....she is so authentic.  Not a phony like Erika Kirk.  I wish she had been spared.  Predators KNOW who to go after.  She had no chance. / []
Trump needs to be put in prison. / []
We will never, ever forget you, Virginia Giuffre <3 / []
This broke my heart. Oh sweet Virginia… fly high dear Angel…no more pain. / []
RULE #1   Never, never allow yourself to be impressed to the point of intimidation by a Billionaire. / []
We failed her / []
She should have named everyone. / ["I'm guessing she feared for her kids."]
It should be called, the Trumpstein files. Trump was in on it. He knew damn well who Maxwell and Epstein were and what they were all about. Trump wouldn't be hiding the files at all costs, unless he is guilty. He doesn't care about anyone else enough to go threw such effort. / []
RIP Miss Virginia 😢.  Im so sorry this was your life experience bc of crappy people that exist and existed. You deserved better. / []
Poor baby girl. So sorry this happened to her. 💔 / []
Of course the guy "died" in jail, just like Epstein "killed himself". The other rich and powerful perpetrators can't allow anyone taking a plea deal and rat out all of them. Trump called the cops on Epstein and make no mistake, he had him killed before he made it to court. Hence, the plethora of deception which doesn't add up, no matter how you slice it. Trump will pardon Maxwell, just like the 1500+ criminals he pardoned. Trump is corrupt to the core. / []
The tragedy is that the southern district of new your , the DOJ did NOT follow up when they could and now it’s been commandeered by the perpetrators. / []
Who killed her? / ['Them', 'They']
Beyond sad. / []
Her comment about having a sign on her forehead is so, so true. I was abused in one form or another since I was a teen. Then I married my ex husband who abused me in every way possible that you can use that word. Would have killed me if I didn’t get out. But then it began again for another 10 years after that. I finally had my ah-ha moment, and said no more! A few months later a man I had a huge crush on ironically came back into my life. We have been married for 21 years now. One thing I must say is the person being abused MUST THEMSELVES have their ah-ha moment. You can help them, be there as much as you want, but they must find that place in their soul. If you listen Virginia mentioned it as well when she escaped to Thailand. RIP in peace Virginia. / []
EVIL, EVIL, EVIL! / []
Epstein & Maxwell were psychotic narcissistic manipulators who took a violated child vulnerable and needing guidance and with no compassion whatsoever ripped her child psyche to death. / []
She was either an Oscar award worthy actor or the elite world is a dark horrible place. / []
with this attitude, she did not kill herself.... she is one of several that have died... / []
Such sweetness and innocence in her  voice / []
Where was her father in all this?  He dropped her off and never followed up on her.  She was incredibly brave to come forward. May she be at peace. / ["Hes the one who first assaulted her at 7. She named him in her book. He's the one who started it and then let his friend also abuse her"]
The cover up in the US is even more despicable disgusting and diabolical than the case itself- and even worse it's got the official hallmark of CIA and Mossad blackmail stamped all over it / []
Sadly, Virginia's husband is an alcoholic who beat her.  Her life ended terribly by another man abusing her. / []
And then she winds up married to an abuser. She breaks my heart. / []
1:06 red flag:  she initiated the encounter or it never happened.  She called out Epstein but not this mystery person?  The truth would wreck her victim narrative.  Now we'll never know for certain.  How convenient. / []
Maxwell should be punished unmercifully. What an animal! My heart hurts for this poor girl / []
1:03:20 Sharks can smell blood in the water. These predators can smell “the blood” of who has already been abused, who is vulnerable, who they can manipulate. / []
Good for u  maxwell should do life for what she did / []
This is so sad. People that sexually abuse children should be buried under the jail and never see the light of day. RIP Mrs. Giuffre. / []
Virginia was betrayed by many in her life. So sad / []
We know you did not end your life by your own means.  Shame on those that have none. / []
Acknowledge what you have done to me, and what you have done to so many other girls 😢thank you for speaking your truth, Virginia, may you rest in peace. / []
And to think Maxwell was born on Dec. 25. / []
It's so disturbing that her parents apparently let a teenage girl just fly all over the world with people they knew nothing about. / []
Wow, a lot of heartless morons on here! Pissed off she exonerated Trump? Her father worked at Mar-a-Lago. Got her a job there as well! You need to go do your homework because Trump was angry at Epstein. Didn’t want her involved over at his place. She was one of the earliest and longest in his trafficking scheme. It caught up with British royalty, but her court testimony as well as her friend who assisted with her book HAVE the list! Trump is NOT on it! A gubernatorial candidate for a western state is. A PM who had sick torture as his fetish is. Guaranteed there’s been a TON of hush money trading hands. I want to say Prince Andrew paid her like $22 million to hide his name. He was just stripped of all royal titles and booted to pauper because they knew the truth was coming out and the evidence would be overwhelming. She knew she’d have a bounty on her head when she told her side. She was finally a happily married mother of 3 in rural Australia, and she just coincidentally killed herself in time with this? / []
RIP Virginia 💗 / []
When she talks about the younger girls who didn’t speak English who were in the room with her and Andrew, I immediately thought of the modeling agencies in the 90’s. Those young girls were probably underage models. Those modeling agencies were absolutely used as s€x traff!cking rings back then. Absolutely disgusting. / ['Not probably. Many of them intact were.']
Do yall notice she said the media and others need to help . Now do you see how the awhole is controlling the media. / []
She was failed, at every turn. Rest easy, peacefully, lovely soul 🫴🏽💗🌸🕊️ / []
every one needs to watch this full interview from 2019 and how 6 years later predators in power are still trying to protect the pedophiles. / []
I dont trust this woman's BS / []
😢🤬 / []
decorations, kind of like the dancers at trump's roaring twenties party / []
Everybody who was part of this cruel "game" should be punished: doctor,s dentist, psychologists, housekeepers.....who didn't do anything against it. What a shame!!! Where is the international effort to stop these might people who keeping going on with abusing young girls!! / []
Put him in the Prison Hulks!!! / []
I cannot believe that she is no longer here.🤍🕊️ I am glad I saw her story before she. 😢 / []
Why did she keep going back to the island I mean you’re getting abused and you don’t leave? / ["Thank you for being a perfect example of why abused girls and women don't come forward. Did you even watch the interview? She'd been abused since age 7. She was broken down mentally and emotionally--groomed--to think that this was normal and inevitable. No one ever protected her before; why should she think anyone would protect her then?"]
And this kind of stuff is going on all over the world. It's heartbreaking and unforgivable. / []
Hi hon, I don’t understand how other men who are at these parties would let these girls be violated. They knew what was going on. / []
And she loveditsomuch, the money, the excitement, and wow, a prince, but then she realised queen had bags of money! / []
This is what happens when parents not caring for the child. She was only 13 and she had to work and earn her life. Why was she in school, why she was not helped after the first sexual abuse. Her parents are the one who is very guilty of her situation. / []
I think anybody who went to one of those parties should’ve reported what was going on even if they hadn’t been one of the ones attacking these girls I knew it was happening so they have a responsibility / []
JUSTICE for her and all the others who were abused. There are still so many people who don' t want that the truth will come to light. Unbelievable! / []
Don’t think you would ever get over that. People can really hurt you without care and you’re stuck with it for a long time in your mind. I’m glad she told her story . She must have been a really sensitive moral person naturally. Tragic / []
I am overwhelmed by the story of this brave woman, who fortunedly has also known happiness. Edward, formerly known as Prince is finally punished by the King. How can his daughters still respect him. / []
This makes my blood boil. This interview w/Virginia really drives home why Trump & the Republicans in the US Congress are preventing the full disclosure of the Epstein Files. Trump is protecting himself & all of the other immensely wealthy powerful PPL that, at a minimum, knew exactly what Epstein/Maxwell were up to & those that took part in the sexual abuse of these young girls. / []
May Virginia’s tired weary souls find peace . We will speak for you now 😢 / []
I am having a problem with the interviewer and her questions? As a victim of SA myself I felt she was being cold and calculating and not empathetic. She shouldve asked for her questions to be checked over by a therapist! You think she could smile from time to time. Ugh. I am so sorry Virginia that you had to go through all of this. Bless your soul. / []
To commenters saying Virginia should have revealed all predators’ names before her death: are you dumb?!? The interlinked system of extremely powerful people who abused her could ruin/end the lives of everyone she loved with a snap of their fingers, just like they ruined/ended hers.  There are THOUSANDS of Epstein victims, with a million reasons why those still alive cannot come forward. Victims cannot be expected to individually release names to the public- they MUST be protected and have organizations like the FBI (who already HAVE the names) release that info. Stop demanding that individuals victims take down these predators and demand that the government RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!!!   Rest in power Virginia, and all the children whose lives are stolen by childhood abuse. / ['💥👏🙏']
Threats, confusion,  intimidation, trauma bonding, promises so as to "bait" her.  She has been through hell.  😔 / []
Naomi Campbell needs to be questioned in front of congress / []
Just the people Diddy rituals,that they would be dismembered for trying to move or try to fight back.or made to eat their own vomit or feces / []
Im speechless.  RIP KID. / []
Wow, what shittie parents she had? They're meant to protect you, ffs / []
I wonder if she knew who her dad was back then   ,wonder if she googled,    awful what happened,  😞 / []
Release. The. Files. / []
Horrific! I’m so sorry this happened and we STILL don’t know all the criminals involved. Release the FULL Epstein files. / []
Now these folks are out here trying to clean up their filth through unaliving folks. / []
Such a tragedy that she is gone. / []
I do believe that a lot of this stuff happened to Virginia, but her story changes a lot and one documentary she stated that her parents were in a homeless shelter or they were homeless and that’s where she was picked up by Jeffrey Epstein / []
Were in the hell was the parents there is no way you can not see this on any child you no your child I do sad and evil shit / []
The thought of powerful men and women ruling this world with all their money and using innocent young lives as nothing more than objects to be played, with sickens my heart!! / []
Huh 1:13:23 / []
She said in her book her dad sexually abused her and this interview she said a family friend / []
Rip Virginia❤Someone must get these names out so they are accountable ❤ / []
And now dead. It’s amazing how many people die prematurely when it involves people in control. / []
This is unbelievably sad 😭 she deserves the world. Everyone failed her. / []
RIP sweet Virginia 🙏 😢 / []
She's sadly gone today to an evil system of men and women abusers! This brave woman!! It's so awful she's missed. We love you Virginia!! I still think Andrew had her murdered! We need to remember this poor baby 😭😭. She was such a beautiful woman and so strong! Her courage and bravery brought down the top evil!! I think Maxwell should be charged with murder for the responsibility of her passing!! Maxwell is a huge reason she's gone. Maxwell should be doing life in a real prison, not a celebrity holding cell! / []
Release NAMES.  Where are the unredacted Trumpstein files? / []
WHERE WERE YOUR PARENTS? / []
Y además la vergüenza y el sentimiento de culpa le hacen sentir que está obligada a hacerlo que ya no puede salir de esto / []
Porque cuando se es víctima desde tan corta edad se normaliza el abuso… / []
Why is this only now being shown ? / []
Bless her soul, a complete nightmare! We must open our eyes and see the truth! / []
She was murdered for what she knows about well known people who partook in the sexual abuse.   The truth is going to come out soon. It can’t be hidden. / []
" Who were the people "   answer  " The People who run the world "..... / []
Why are you releasing it now? Stupid 60 mins think we don't know they are in it or not. / []
GOD BLESS you Virginia, for your bravery / []
Was this interview played on 60 Minutes in the USA? / []
Something fishy how she escaped how would they allowed her to have a passport surely they would of kept on to that , I believe she may of been helped without knowing it and many people wanted jef dead and fed up with the blackmail.  Brave lady God bless her / []
It is time to stop picking only on the former Prince Andrew but also the American counterparts poste haste in this sordid mess. It is revealing that there seems to be a code of silence being attached to the scum bags supposedly in high places. Where is the promised transparency by the Justice department in this country? / []
32:39 NOT SUICIDAL SHE SAYS !!! / []
Why does the interviewer appear to be smirking. / []
Seeing photos of this ladies in their teens,they were innocent and vulnerable and most of them were sexually abused at a very young age 😢 / []
Naive to think media  owners and authorities don't know about this / []
HELLS yes, Lisandra! Right person, right questions, WRONG answer. / []
You can see it in photo, this happened to my daughter by a Christian schoolteacher. These girls are among some of the strongest young ladies. / ['Until they are not 💔']
We need to know so much more about her initial accident with the bus and her death.   I doubt very much this was really suicide- she had children and so much to live for!!   Rest in Peace Virginia-- we will continue your fight! / []
19:36 everyone who knew about this, who saw this, who read about this, who befriended these guys (and thought 'that sort of thing was going on but i wasn't sure') should be in prison - every single rat scumbag millionaire, ESPECIALLY ghislaine !  the right hand of the devil is often the most dangerous trojan horse of all, and here's a prime example !  the accessory to crimes statutes absolutey fits here.  just because you didn't pull the trigger, because you were driving and your friend shot and killed the clerk in the gas station doesn't mean YOU DID NOT COMMIT MURDER ! / []
Media too busy bashing Trump to worry about capturing the real criminals and punishing them / []
And, you got paid well. Poor decisions you made because of you liked being there with powerful people with money. You weren’t there at gun points. You were young and had poor self value. It’s your mistake , too.  Money, fame, power….are attractive things…and you didn’t have high self esteem. Let it go and leave peacefully. You owe to yourself. There are millions of victims in this world without voluntarily participating with evildoers. You’re beautiful person no matter what others did to you. Move forward with your life. Best wishes for you❤😊 / []
And Trump has Maxwell transferred from prison to a holiday camp. / []
Murdered! RIP Virginia 🙏 ❤ / []
Ghislane was recruiting in Mar-a-Lago?!!! That does not look good, Mr. President. I really want the Epstein files to be released to the public! NOW!!! / []
President Clinton was often on that plane! / ['As was Trump.']
Those party photos of adults with one young (unrelated) girl present ARE the Epstein list. Those photos of adults and young girls with Gislaine Maxwell or Epstein present ARE the Epstein list.   No healthy adult wants kids around when they're drinking and partying with other adults. / []
This makes me look at the models and actors and actresses so differently. I do not envy those people, who knows what they went through to get where they are and how many didn’t make it out alive. / []
Thanks Tara I always knew you were  a person  of good will Around the world , we have to stick together and stand up to these sick people , even if some of us voted for them , or did lots of business / []
Wait. She's not dead guys. Where did you hear this?? / []
Saddest thing I've seen 😢 / []
Rest in Eternal Peace Virginia ✨️🙌🙏 Justice ⚖️ Will Prevail 🙌🙏⚘️ / []
She was young and naive but she was willing to take the risk to get ahead. She wanted a better life, unfortunately paid a high price. / []
She says, I have a wonderful life now! 32:00!! She thought of suicide at the time!! And to be honest, a lot of people would, that is HORRIFIC TO GO THROUGH!! But IMO, SHE DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE!! They were afraid of her talking and coming out with NAMES!! RIP VIRGINIA🙏🏼😇 WE WILL PROSECUTE THEM PEDO’S!! / []
Wow, that part at about 28 minutes in.  It´s so disturbing-- Naomi Campbell´s big boat birthday party. Virginia makes an excellent point about clearly being a very young girl, and no one said anything (including Naomi herself)???!!! So fffff---ed up.  🙄🙄🙄 I really hope there´s justice for Virginia and all the victims soon. It´s so incredibly disturbing, and way, way overdue. / ["Campbell was besties with P Diddler. That's why she didn't bat an eye at a child present at her party.", '@Arandompersonontheinternet123 Ya, well at least he has served some (but not enough) time in prison for his crimes.  Probably will be pardoned by Herr Gropenfuhrer soon, though. 🙄']
Imagine the world view Virginia had, how do you have hope when you have been used by the most powerful people in the world? / []
Where were Virginia’s parents when this terrible trafficking occurred?! She says she was sexually abused at age 7 by a family friend! What in this world were her parents doing when this happened? And then how did she go on from an age 7 victim to being a child, then teenage abuse victim? / []
Too little too late. She would be here today if true justice existed. / []
Molester Are  Governing  America   Release TRUMPSTEIN files !!!! / ['Too many democrats will be affected 😮', '@cindynations4774it’s the 1%—period. Sick, cold, heartless people. Looking down on people and using people—even children :(']
so her parents just give her away? they are to blame too / []
Where is she now! Wherever she is I hope she lives the life that any child deserves . I’m heartbroken / ['She unalived herself earlier this year. 😞']
Virginia Giuffre could have said “no” at any time. / ['Pppffftt are you serious??? Thousands of underaged girls were molested by Epstein, an adult. Maxwell lured them all in, they thought they could trust her. Read the book & you will understand how they were manipulated.']
So so sad to hear her and know she's not here. Epstein was not the only one others need to be brought to justice it's infuriating they will get away with this. She was one brave lady / []
Can someone that has a better understanding of her trauma explain to me why she didn’t refuse and leave after they instructed her to undress and have sex with Epstein? All the SA survivors never get into that key moment and I’m really trying to understand. Is it because they have a hard time saying “no”? / ['Read the book & you will understand...']
The worst thing she could've ever done to herself after everything she went through was take her own life . I wish friends or family just checked on her on a daily basis . She should've never been left by herself! 😢 / []
Read E. Sue Blume’s “Secret Survivors” to understand WHY child sexual abuse victims are re-victimized. / []
That question of why you didn’t run… when your someone like Virginia you are conditioned for that. Also Epstein and Ghislane were masters of creating a power imbalance so girls like her  don’t feel like there is a choice. / []
I posted this interview on Bluesky and Bluesky flagged me account and I was unable to share this news on the Bluesky platform. This is concerning to me. / ['They’re all on there']
This shows it was posted 2 days ago!!! It NEVER aired on 60 minutes in the US!?? Why!?? This clearly shows the President Trump wasn't in with this Epstein and THEY KNOW IT!! SHE WAS TREATED WELL AT MARA LOGO... ABC CAN'T HAVE THAT!!! Who are some of these "celebrities"! Is that Al Pacino?? / []
At 17 I doubt you don’t know the difference between right from wrong. / ["i'm 57 and still getting abuse by some people. Some will die without noticing that they've been abused."]
Most in Hollywood or in the upper-crust allow animal abuse and pedophilia  I relate to her abuse     Thank you Virginia for being our voice and I’m sorry for what Epstein and your husband did   You are missed   😭☮️♾️ / []
Where did Jeffrey and maxwell got their money from (all of their wealth needs to be distributed among their victims) / ["JE stole 46 Million from someone he was associated with & that man didn't push charges 🤔"]
Only the surviving victims are the gatekeepers to the unredacted truth. The government is restrained by secrecy laws. / []
My heart is breaking every second of this video / []
RIP 💔 / []
Virginia was murdered. It was NOT suicide... / []
Sorry Virginia,  but Trump is not gonna do crap according to him this is just a scam the Democrats made up. / []
Trump let Ghislaine out of prison in exchange for her silence. That's all you need to know about trump and his involvement.  Go read the Katie Johnson lawsuit docs online. He beat and raped her at 13.  He threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone. This is how these people work. / []
We believe her every word! / []
Those evil people who did this to you  shall pay for their bad deeds. / []
Horrible what happened to this woman😢 / []
I just don’t believe her it’s all very rehearsed / []
My ❤ breaks for you and others like you 😢 so sorry you went through that.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢 / []
She was definitely murdered!  She and all others deserve JUSTICE and ACCOUNTABILITY!  RELEASE THE DAMN FILES! / []
This is why we must hold the elite accountable. This could be any woman. This could be anyone’s child if we allow these injustices to continue. / []
Suspect anger could have been useful had ir not turned inward? / []
rest in peace virginia you were such a strong human being and i will always be suspicious of this because you seemed in a good place! you didnt deserve this at all i cant describe how furious i am that it led to this! she is one of the many victims of these monsters it broke my heart hearing of your passing if all of us cant get justice for all these many victims once in for all ill never stop being ashamed of what society have become. 1:14:03 "i implore the community to please stand next to me and help me bring down all those bad people. And if you got somebody in your life doing this to you too, speak out. Stand up. The times are changing as they should be and its a good time to start holding those monsters accountable" my heart is broken society needs to get this right there is just no other way.. you cannot turn a blind eye to abuse in any form. I cant even start to imagine the suffering you went through and so many others.. / []
She said something.  NO one picked up on  right around 35min exactly. She said. She was sent to the ISLANDS !!! With an s. PLURAL !!!!!  There’s definitely multiple islands they have not came clean about or been busted on. . How many bodies are buried on them / []
I am sympathetic for her, but why didn't she contact her father? / ["When I was in college I was date raped.  I told my mom and she told me I was making the story up in order to avoid taking responsibility.  Then she coerced me into telling my brothers.  And she told my dad, who came to visit me and told me he didn't believe me either.  Why should she have felt safe telling her parents whom I can almost guarantee already knew about her life leading up to that moment, and either didn't want to talk about it or blamed her on some level?", 'JE paid her father off']
RIP Virginia. The public will not stop fighting for the truth to come out. It’s not ok for powerful men and governments to be involved in the abuse of children. / []
I think Virginia saved those girls, who she was expected to bring in.  She helped them read between the lines. ❤ No guilt,  Virginia. 🫂✊. Maybe you rest in  peace. / []
Giuffre led the way for many more women to come forward about their own abuse by Epstein and those around him. In April of this year, 2025. Giuffre died by suicide in Australia, where she lived for many years with her husband and three children. She was just 41 years old. / []
Red flag! Not letting the father in was a Red Flag.  Still, father’s tend to be submissive toward these things. As parents we are blinded by things like not believing they our children may be harmed by others. / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES! / []
Such an eloquent speaker and a clear communicator. She's really good at expressing the emotions she felt and describing the situations she found herself in, and explaining what exactly was going on. Great story teller, very good at keeping the listeners attention. / []
She didn't commit suicide, everyone knows it. / []
Awful. / []
The horror / []
RIP, dear Virginia! Now you're not suffering anymore 😢 / []
Her parents, though. Where were they??? / []
She deserves justice. Her abusers should be exposed.  There are probably many like  stories that were never told. Release the Epstein files!!! / []
Well, back then it wasn’t sex trafficking even if it was. An escort type of “business “ is still exploitation. Unfortunately, she tiptoed around what happened. / []
Very sad and if Trump pardons Maxwell he is 100% involved with underage sex trafficking. / ["Either way, pardon or not, 45 is involved in s3x traffiking.\nAdults don't knowingly hang around s3x criminals unless they're open to it."]
It's evil how people sexually or physically abuse children or anyone or anything.  It's *DEMONIC.*    RIP 🙏  😢 / []
I thought she was poor. Riding houses is expensive. Keeping them well is even more so expensive. Also, what happened to the first abuser? / []
Trump better not give Ghislane Maxwell a pardon or deal of any kind.  It's sickening GM was moved to a different prison. / []
Release the files / []
She said if ever was found to have did it herself that it would not be the case- why doesn’t anyone report on that- and look into it. She was exposing a lot of powerful people. / []
Its so disgusting how these vile predators do not even recognize young women as people and view them as a toy to be played with and used. EVIL! / []
This beautiful, intelligent woman is so courageous and brave to talk on this show about what these horrible pedophiles did to her. Thank you for speaking out and telling your story. / []
This evil is easy to understand.    Why would you expect Godly things from UN - Godly people? These people have no belief or fear of God, they have no love for their fellow man or woman, they look out only for them selves. Vengeance is mine says the Lord. / []
So sad 😢! 😓💔🙏💜 / []
RIP: VIRGINIA ROBERTS GIUFFRE 💖 / []
The deception is so premeditated, organized and complete. This poor woman didn't have much of a chance. And the Epstein groomers all knew it. They can sense someone's who's an easy mark. Despicable. Someone in the position she was in her experiences already with sex abuse, she didn't know what trust was or what it looked like. She also didn't have the words to say "no". Contrary to popular opinion, unless you are taught solid boundaries, you don't automatically have the words to create them out of nothing. That's how it works. Also, I don't think she should be judged for going back bc of the money. Her extremely low self-esteem set her up for a sense of defeatism. / []
Heartbreaking, her whole life was abuse and betrayal, poor Virginia... There is special place in hell for pedophiles! / []
Disgusting! Release the TRUMPSTEIN files! All involved need to be prosecuted / []
Cant understand why her parents would put her in this position in first place. / ['For $$']
The American Government is directly involved, and it's the TAX payers that finance it. / []
Amazing! / []
Virginia was so, so brave. I wish the world offered her more support and protection. / []
Never forget Trump wished Ghislaine well and moved her to a soft detention facility. / []
REST IN POWER, VIRGINIA! 🙏🏼 WARRIOR / []
RELEASE THE FILES!! Virginia deserves JUSTICE!! / []
How did Epstein & Gilane explain who she was when she was traveling alone with them? / ['They were the absolute elite. Who are never questioned', 'You forget Epstein owned jet(s) and paid the pilots.  If it did come up he could always say she was a model, niece, etc.', 'As VG says in her book, people naturally thought she was their daughter.']
She was killed 😢 / []
would seem to me finding the security guards who were in the video monitoring room in eptsteins apartment would be rather important part of any investigation / []
Girls 7:59  great lesson, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is! Say no and goodbye, polite little girls are a thing of the past / []
Every adult in her life was a failure. / ['Not every adult. You may point a finger to those who actually were.']
She was 16! The frontal lobe of her brain would not be fully developed to process logic for another decade. And like all victims she apologises for her reaction. Infuriating. Are journalist not educated regarding these things? She’s describing disassociation / ['The interviewer is super thick.']
—- I just finished watching this whole interview.  I just don’t understand why Virginia only named (now former) Prince Andrew.  Why didn’t she name any of the other people? / ["Because she had photo's to prove the connection with Andrew Windsor"]
Rest in peace Virginia / []
Blackmail is also disgusting behavior on top of all the other nastiness. One day it will all be out. / []
Work Golf within the Low! / []
She speaks and unedited / []
Has she named any U.S. men as her abusers? . Or was she selected with her revenge. I will not be buying the book, to find out as  the family do not deserve to inherit the money from it's sales. / []
Forget about sex and focus on bigger story on who he is working for in his blackmail ring……oh forgot…..protect Israel at all cost / []
I absolutely detest when the reporter asked her why she “followed those orders to Undress”. This is the same typical blame on the victim that the majority of people who have never had this happen to them.  What this woman endured as a child and as a grown woman is reprehensible, and everyone involved should be held accountable! / ['Absolutely incorrect. This is a very compassionate reporter who has a great rapport with her']
Justice for all the victims and survivors. The longer they hold the files the more guilty they are. And trump is using them as blackmail / []
Rest in peace Virginia. Your story will not be forgotten. We won’t stop asking for the release of the Epstein files. It’ll be a cold day in hell if it Trump pardons pedo Ghislaine. You made a difference Virgina ❤ Thank you. / []
She is so much more than a bottle of champagne, she deserved peace after all she’d been through :( not death… such a tender soul 😔 / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES NOW! / []
Can’t believe she’s gone. She did so much. RIP angel. / []
Everything is being recorded.   "Release the files" / []
To be a good human, if you see something, do something! Be the voice for victims who can't.  And document your disclosure, so you have that in your back pocket! I loved the spark in your eyes when you explained how you felt when your friend told you he was arrested.  I hope your everday is full of spark! / []
I'd say that 90% of human beings will do whatever it takes to get what they want, even if it harms others people. They dont care. / []
I am so sad she is not here today to continue to be with her kids. She has been through so much abuse. / []
It took me 4 hours to watch this. I cried. I needed to just breath. Virginia you are safe now. Your voice has been heard all around the world and makes me want to make a difference wherever I can. I wish you were here to create an Empire, to bring every single one of these demons to justice. Your name is out there and you've created a voice / []
I don't believe the government is honest enough to do anything right. / []
Why didn’t you leave? / ['She was naive.  \nHer parents were no help protecting her.  \nShe was on her own with no one to confide to.\nShe was unaware she was groomed and probably blamed herself in some way.\nShe believed she would become a masseuse and could walk away with a certificate. \nEpstein told her he owned the cops and threatened her little brother.\nThe hopelessness of being disappointed by too many adults who used her had to affect her.\nIn her mind, where could she go that was safe, given her past?  Life taught her this is all there is.\n...']
How fuckin high is the interviewer?!😂😮 / []
I don’t like how she tries to throw Naomi under the bus when this setting was VERY normal for Naomi who was also put in those situations as a child herself. She started modeling very young and her mother allowed her to live with designers unsupervised. / ["The problem is that the whole thing is normalised in these settings and if you're not standing up against it, that is an issue, why would you deny that?"]
It took so much courage for her to go through this interview, only for the interviewer to have a smug look on her face the entire time. / []
I'm British and can't fathom why Andy isn't in jail..face palm. / []
What really happen with this woman when she was 7 years old nobody can know for sure. I can pretend that I was sexually abused when I was 7 years old too. For one thing, it is absolutely impossible for a parent to not realise that something terrible has happened with his child and made him talk about. / ['In a normal household healthy undistracted parents notice.  There are so many not normal/not healthy people that dysfunctional, neglect, alcoholic, drug addict, groomer, pervert, pedo, SA, grape, rufi3,  and abuse are words.']
Her suicide says it all..that's the gravity of the situation. / []
The crime against her and others like her is so deploravle, and so rampant in this world!  It denotes a serious cancer in humanity! / []
Blackmail biz completed, picked up by Putin....the reat we kniw / []
I'm sure how to say this, but does she have some traits that seem to attract abusive people? Or simply too gullible, in her words? / []
She left to go abroad at 16? Like others searching for the high life. It was all her choice. She could of stopped / []
Andrew definitely abused Virginia, and he knows it is true. He has abused many; it's just that he got caught on camera. These people will be named and shamed. / []
I love this interviewer. Her interviewing skills are brilliant. / []
Release THE Epstein Files!!!! / []
You can tell how pretty and beautiful she must have been with Big Blue Eyes and Angelic blond hair . And How those Demons used her to slake their evi.... she said the MOST Evil and Vicious Man was Isreali PM Ehud Olmert,who beat her up,and left her bleeding from all orffices. 😡😡😭😭 Nobody in the World deserves what she endured. / []
RIP Virginia / []
God bless her soul 💔 / []
25:26 Epstein tells Virginia he owns the Palm Beach Police Department that is why he was released in 2008 after being caught / ['☑️', 'Alex Acosta was perverting the course of justice then...he eventually resigned 🤬']
Why Trump no release the Epstein Files if she was at Mar a Lago? / []
Virginia was silenced. She said," The truth will come out." She knew she was in danger because she knew too much. Justice will prevail. This is so painful to hear, but I am sitting listening to her because I have to. I owe her that respect and honour her courage for speaking up and out. / ['I feel the same way about Virginia.', 'Agreed', "She also said she thought about suicide all the time . . I've never heard her say it except now , through this interview. . I really think she killed herself  and I always thought she was murdered . But now I doubt that. .very sad!", '\u200b@Mauve77the poor girl lived a life of hell since the age of 7. She never had a break. Even her husband beat her. But there was a point where she said, not in this interview, that she told people she was not suicidal once she had her 3 children. She loved them intensely. Her book made me tear up.', '@Mauve77I agree. I feel like she believed her duties on this earth were fulfilled with Epstein being *dead* and her story, her court statements being filed, and her being a mother, and finally experiencing her new life with her husband and with her book just released. I believe her lifetime of traumas and unbelievable turmoil that her soul had left her body. \n\nThe world has let her down in every way possible, but the very least that we can do is keep her story and her words alive with us for justice not only for her, but for all the victims…']
So, the US Justice Department is in charge. How convenient!!! / []
HAS ANYONE BUT ME PICKED UP ON HER SPEAKING OF EPSTEIN IN THE PRESENT SENCE...40:26 / []
It's sickening how the rich and powerful get away with this stuff ... and they always prey on the most vulnerable, no different than the Catholic priests. / []
I wish she stayed alive to watch the demons get reprimanded 😮. So sad 🙏🏻😢. I wish she had the strength to run away / []
Virginia was a very courageous woman who unfortunately was fighting a big battle without the support from all wise and kind people around th3 world united as one ..Sadly we can nit bring her back ..She needed to be crowned by the whole world for promoting Love  and wisdom not Fear or ignorance The world need to learn about the wisdom of human values and everyone specially leaders who are working to genuinely  promote justice and true wellbeing / []
Why is this 2019 interview only being released now ?  Seems to have been strateigcally deployed now to cause maximum damage instead of being released years ago so that the public could have seen for themselves that she was telling the truth. / []
“….the THOUSANDS of victims…” / []
Interesting that her father found employment for her, where Ghislaine frequented. / []
And no arrest?! / []
As a psychotherapist, I am shocked out of my mind. How could NOBODY help that young girl???!!?? / ['“Shocked out of your mind???!!!!”….you should be well aware IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY to young women and men in this country!!', "Because she didn't have money, and her parents were complicit in abuse by her father, and irresponsible, and she lives in the US?  \nShe ran away from home from 13yo.  Her mother didn't want her back after she was rescued from her 2nd pedo owner, so put her in juvie.  She escaped and her father agreed to take her in again, and got her a job at MaL All was good for a while.\nBut then Ghislaine found her there.  Which is why there is an age limit for working in such places, though she was on reception not massages.", "Where do You study????? You don't know NOTHING ABOUT REAL LIFE", 'How could she agree to recruit new  "victims of sex trafficking"? \nIn this infamous picture with "Randy Andy" Virginia doesn\'t look like a victim. \nShe quite voluntarily accepted the dirty "Epstein/Maxwell" rules... having an opportunity to escape it at any time.', "That's normal for victims. Nobody wants to be involved"]
“They made it seem like ‘this is just how the world works’…” I’m beginning to think they were 100% correct. / []
I am so sorry for this woman. She is not with us anymore. May she rest in peace. 😢 / []
Virginia was covering up donald trump, she also participated in some of the trafficking herself. / []
Rest in peace, Virginia. / []
It’s called grooming!! / []
I am not sure I buy all of this young ladies story. / []
We have to find such offenders with all means and pray for the sad victims. Breaks my heart. God shall judge those evil persons eternally. They destroy young souls from start, they are scared from the beginning. God have mercy with the victims and give justice / []
Aussies still have some actual journos at least / []
The interviewer has done a very good job of asking the right questions and listening to Virginia.  Very much different from most interviewers. / []
Wow! and all these encounters occurred within the less than  two years (over 20 years ago)  she was involved with Epstein, not sure much of this adds up,it must be corroborated. / []
I pray these predators get what they deserve! Justice now!!! Release the files!! Rest in peace beautiful soul❤ / []
How come it's only Andrew who's name is out there / []
I wish she was still here with us. A wise woman who wanted to bring light and justice to the world. Rest in Peace Virginia. / []
Why didn't Virginia report every person that abused her and the rich men who were at the house and with Ebstein. / []
Extremely disrespectful for the journalist if you can call her that, to “pry” on the details and getting her to “go back “ to that room.  She’s reliving her trauma infront of you . Also, fear can paralize  you . / []
It’s not just powerful men it’s just men / []
They are paying now in 2025 for their sins. Ms Maxwell is in jail.  Epstein was probably murdered. Prince Andrew is no longer a Prince. The many other ordinary people who knew what was going on have yet to pay for turning a blind eye. / []
Why didn't u go to the cops. / ['the cops work for THEM!', 'its a betrayal act that she cant do, and the cops are paid actors.']
This is a great interview. Ms Giuffre was totally convinving on the ordeal she went through. She said she wanted the abusers to be named and shamed, to apologize,  and to go on trial. Many high-powered men were involved as participants, enablers, and protectors of the Epstein-Maxwell trafficking and extortion ring. One of those involved was Epstein's best friend for a decade or more, Donald Trump. He and his confederates in the cabinet,Congress and the courts will keep the Epstein files from ever being released. They may have already been destroyed, or had large portions concealed or redacted. The corruption that Ms Giuffre mentioned in this interview has never ended and is continuing today. / []
Virginia does look very happy in the photograph with Prince Andrew although she could of course have been putting on a good front. / ['She may have met him, but she made up the story about having sex with him.']
She is very credible. / []
Mossad did this to her / []
Her story is that of many sexually exploited and trafficked victims. Abusive background, frequently going missing, emotionally absent parents, "befriended" by Predators who can smell vulnerability..Use of victims to faciliate and enable the abuse by recruiting other victims is also another common feature of trafficking.  Its the story of many victims. Poor woman. People dont appreciate how damaged these women are. The annoying interviewer pulling faces of disbelief throughout and asking stupid questions like why did you back?  is showing her ignorance. / []
This beautiful lady is real. I can say God bless however, Lord, ALL these men to come to your wrath. / []
When was this filmed? / []
Dear Virginia RIP. If there’s no justice in this world it will be at the end of the world! Jesus Christ will judge. Amen 🙏 / []
Joa ist doch immer das gleiche und man muss das nicht machen, wenn man nicht will sorry!  Ich wurde oft zu irgendwas eingeladen essen oder noch schlimmeres mit fremden und bin weggelaufen und hab den gezeigt 🖕🏼 und mir egal, ob ich dann gemobbt werde haha kann ich nur 😂 lachen darüber🖕🏼  Ich suche mir die Leute aus nicht umgekehrt !Macht es auch so ! / []
So sad she passed ! Was this a natural death or suicidal after writing her book!!? / ['This is a great video to educate the young women!!']
You dearest darling Virginia. God bless you. May we protect your children. / []
Ihud Barack was her punishment / []
Naomi Campbell is complicit / []
Poor Virginia / she has gone through hell ... rest in peace now ... once you deal with powerful and rich people U R in trouble. Never sell your body and soul to such people!!! / []
This is why every school needs to teach sex and relationship education. It will help young people spot abusers before they get in too deep. And that is why it never gets taught. Because the abusers get into power and decide what we should all learn. / []
This is literally the one time she has no fucking reason to lie and thank God people actually believed her instead of calling her insane / []
Every young person should get psychology lessons on how to spot psychopaths and narcissists. It could have saved so many lives. / []
Poor Virginia... many of us who are groomed as children understand exactly what she is saying. Ghislaine and Epstein are/were evil. / []
Protect her children now that they k.illed her / []
I pray her children are safe... Horrific evil... I hope justice will prevail... Some day soon / []
❤❤❤bless you Virginia❤❤❤ / []
At the 29th minute she calls out Naomi Campbell. I would like to hear her response and the response of every person who ever hosted parties where minors were present. Trafficking occurred in front of their eyes. / ['same thing went through my head loking at that picture. she looked like a child', 'Naomi Campbell would rather everyone believe that she is talented and beautiful and that is why she is in the position she is in', 'Naomi owns an island right by Epsteins old house. I believe Joe Biden does as well. Very telling.', '@lukewarmnomore13Joe Biden does not own a home in Florida.']
how are the security guards not speaking!!!! Shame in them!! / []
The rich and powerful always get away with murders... / []
Justice for her 😢 / []
scary stuff, glad that first meeting she didn’t outwardly panic. they might have killed her / []
I wish I could have wrapped her up and stopped her from ending her life😥 / []
Where are her parents now? Why did they not jump in and help with the first abuse? / ['Her father was the abuser!']
Americans have failed the world in every possible way but they cannot let this one slide. We need justice and stop allowing the rich and powerful to abuse whomever they like. / ['Are you serious with this crap? The one person she named was BRITISH ROYALTY! This is NOT a purely American issue.', 'Americans really failed the world with Prince Andrew and Ghislaine, right?']
😢😢❤ / []
God Bless YOU Virginia, RIP ❤ / []
Unbelievably sad sad sad / []
Virginia, brave intelligent courageous beautiful human being ❤❤❤rest in peace / []
You better believe it was all built on corruption from sea to shinning sea! / []
I truly believe she got murdered, someone didn't want their name to come out.  May rest easy❤❤❤❤ / []
Where were her parents! Ask yourself that. That is where the problems started. / []
Why she was running from home? / ['To get a life?']
Rest in Peace... Angel / []
She says everybody abused her, even one of the other girls. / []
Now you are back home in divine love and peace 🙌🏼❤️🙏🏼🌈💫💫💫 / []
When you look into her eyes you see how much her soul was hurt. May she rest in peace. And may her predators and those who didn‘t protect her burn in hell. / []
These files will be released.After Trump went to England the King has srtipped his brother of all his royal stuff.Maybe showing the King his brothers people killed her.The best evidence is locked in the southern district of NY,locked away by Comeys daughter, the US attorney. / []
Tell on your abuser. Release the files. Don't let the bastards bring you down. / []
NO ONE IS ASKING WHY IT TOOK 6 YEARS TO RELEASE THIS????!!!! REALLY!? / []
Naomi Campbell's birthday party....seriously? / []
Now Andrew is just like the rest of us surely he should NOW be forcibly transported to the USA to face the child abuse charges under UK LAW. oR IS HIS BANNISHMENT JUST A JOKE? RIP Virginia. / []
I'm waiting for the body language experts to analyse this interview and give their opinion. That said, I must say that I personally believe her story. / []
These things happen when parents are not parenting their children. Her parents are partly responsible for this / []
I find it ironic that the West tolerates extremist Islamic groups when such groups are actually banned in Muslim countries! Crazy 🤪  Tolerance is beautiful but it shouldn't be equivalent to idiocy. / []
May Jesus give her justice. / []
Can a ybody intervew her parents? / []
How is it not obvious to everyone that:  1. Her being recruited from Maralardo wasn’t an accident & she was not the only one 2. Those predators knew about her before she told them anything 3. Her dad knew dang good and well what he was leaving her to when he walked away from that front door  This whole thing is a very clear pipeline & people who are in charge of the US government at the very top were part of the recruiting process. This is so disgusting & unfair. I’m so mad that she went through all of this & she’s gone. RIP Virginia. At least now you can rest. / ['Mkultra', 'Project paperclip 📎', '(hormones, the Nazis experimented w hormones)', 'Why is anorexia pushed on young ppl through fashion industry? Everything is connected (Balenciaga scandal) but all fashion companies, all modeling agencies.', 'In her book.. she said her dad sa’d her as well. And he let his friend do stuff to her to.']
Parent failed her and the rest is history, very sad. / []
The biggest betrayal is definitely that there was a woman facilitating it. 😥 / []
29:35 "Money should not be able to buy you the power to get away with hurting people - and it's NOT normal, I don't care how rich you are. If you have the privilege of being wealthy,  great, fantastic - do something great about it, do something good with you money. I mean how evil do people have to be to just let that happen."   RELEASE. THE. FILES. CHILDREN ARE STILL BEING HURT. Ignore the evil of misogyny and victim blaming you might come across on this internet if you are an earnest person watching this with their own scars, wondering if it is all just horrible. We deserve justice. It does NOT have to be this way. What was done to you by someone else is NOT your fault. / ['Brain washing and domestic violence have a lot in common for a reason. They try to normalize what we know in our bones is completely not normal. They try to say that this is just the way it is, and they prey on people who were already victimized and desensitized to this violence so that it\'s easier for us to trick ourselves into thinking "maybe they\'re right". We buy in to our abuse. We buy in to the idea of what we will get in return, all the big promises left completely unfulfilled while we get used and abused. We have a cadre of abusers in charge of the US at this moment and more abusers taking power across the world. Listen to her story. Listen to her words. LISTEN TO YOUR GUT.']
As a Licensed Clinical Psychologist, I have worked with far too many young girls and women who have suffered severe sexual abuse. It is an epidemic in the United States. It’s devastating and can live on thru lifetime, unfortunately far too many young children both girls and “Boys who underreport,” Will suicide. I have listened to young children tell a parent only to have the parent refuse to believe them, knowing the truth. Thank you so much for speaking out. It seems that now certain branches of our government are trying to hide, deny the reality to protect the perpetrators. What kind of country have we become. Dr. Michael Mullan / ['This ist the real worldwide epidemic!', 'Y it was prolific at her time as well', 'You have become exactly the country you already were,  as epstein epstein functioned during many presidencies with the complacency of both political parties.', 'Yes, I have seen many different sexual abuse victims and our systems need to change to be informed and caring...Hard to listen to this too --  these questions and putting this on video and evoking such painful material -- she is being retraumatized.']
Holy shit for them to tell her that Epstein owned the Palm Beach police department, like she couldn't even go anywhere. 😯 / []
Virginia Giuffre falsely accused 3 innocent men. #1 - School Bus Driver: She claimed he slammed into her at 70 MPH & had 4 days to live. #2 - Ex-Husband: She claimed he gave her the same bruises that she claimed the school bus driver gave her #3 - Alan Derschowitz: She recanted her accusation & wrote a public apology & claimed that she misremembered / []
15:26  That people have said Virginia consented to what was done to her, or even that she participated voluntarily since: 1.) she didn't try to run away  (although there was probably no way she could have escaped!) AND   2.) she took money for it  > MAKES ME ANGRY! > You don't have to study psychology to realize that there are ways to pressure a young girl into submission even without putting a weapon against her head! Plus she had no idea WHAT they, but especially Maxwell, would put her through. Have people never heard of kidnapped persons who didn't run away although the doors were unlocked? One Podcaster is saying that many of us made bad decisions at that age, and didn't even get money for it ... . Therefore Virginia had no right to present herself as a victim! But the fact that Virginia was given money should make us see how diabolical Maxwell and Epstein acted towards their victims!! Because that was the ultimate trap, as well as a humiliation. / []
I love the way Virginia keep what calm and didn't speak bad about them only said her truth. I wouldn't be able to do that lol. / []
Freeee eqstein / []
Why did she not escape / []
Virginia, you poor, poor darling. Always in  our hearts. / []
I thank God every day that I had a cheeky mother and a solid father. Parents who looked out for us constantly and protected us. Rest in peace dear Virginia. You are with Father God now and the Angels. You did nothing wrong and you will get justice one day. / []
The Daddy hand delivered his Beautiful daughter to those Vultures. He wanted so bad to get his hands on that Rich lifestyle he was willing to pimp out his own daughter. Any real father would have questioned what kind of job interview for a young girl is at night, first red flag right there. Poor young lady it seems as though she really didn't have a chance. Her young life beginning with Rapes. RIP Virginia, you deserved so much better !! Every Devil that ever brought harm to her will face a hell they can't buy their way out of. / ["No real parent drops off a 16 year old for an interview and drives off.   You wait outside.  An interview with a 16 year old takes 15 minutes.  There's no resume to speak of."]
What an excellent interviewer who knew exactly what questions to ask and how to be both probing and sympathetic.!  It's amazing to me that after such a chaotic upbringing and traumatic adolescence (with presumably little in the way of stable education) that V G could sound so intelligent, articulate and self-assured. / []
Why does the interview lady sound so cold? Like a sterile interview questions...may be show bit of empathy in ur tone. / []
My heart breaks for Virginia’s family. 💔 / []
28:59 🙁 she looks so little and lost and as a mom, I want to scoop her up and run. / []
To me she wasn't just a victim. She knew what it was like to be abused but still decided to look for other girls to abuse... She also sold herself in the end to these same people, got a new identity and lives on.. Open your eyes.. nothing is as it seems.. / []
Rest in peace precious woman. / []
Very simple conclusion. It is a honey trap by Israel to blackmail US and Western leaders. Very effective. / []
Where were her parents? School? I’ll never believe she took her own life. Tragic. / []
Release the Epstein Files! Clearly there IS something there or the govt would not be shut down over them.  We know this is the real reason. / []
Finally, it was domestic violence that took her life? / []
So she is a psychopath as well. / ['How???!!!!']
So hurtful and even more so that so many want her to keep quiet about it / []
Trafficked to the people run the World 🌎 / []
Why can't Maxwell get deported to a Sudanese prison right now? / []
I think Richest killed this woman same as killed Princess Diana: / []
The interviewer smiling makes me super uncomfortable.  It puts the lotion on it's skin... / []
Meanwhile, maxwell was movied to a "tennis camp" where there are no bars...just fences, & where her cellmates are white collar offenders - one of them a "Housewife of Salt Lake City"!!  Today, CNN released some of her emails where she describes being much happier, with good food, a clean environment, & no fear of violence.  She was transferred to this camp, when her sentence (20 years) disqualifies anyone with more than a ten year sentence from even being considered. Only the highest levels of government could have interfered to make this happen & there is NO question that's she's been promised "do 3 easy years in the camp, then you'll get a pardon as long as you keep your mouth shut"!   WHO can deny that?    I cannot WAIT for the Epstein files to be released. If there is no wrongdoing, WHY is there this desperate urgency to keep the files secret, or to bribe someone who has been found guilty of trafficking CHILDREN - the youngest 12 y.o.??  If there is ONE person out there who can give a credible answer to any of those questions,  I've beachfront condo in Arizona you may like to buy!! / []
Her life has been so awful - who are these abusers and why are they being protected? I'm so angry for her and the other girls 🤬 JUSTICE is required!! RIP Virginia ❤ / []
Every child is vulnerable. / []
Why is not her father in jail? And the relative that raped her? / ['Didnt she say that one of her childhood perpetrators died in jail?']
Please call out the abuser help others. / []
They are ones buying the drugs, because they have the money, Rich are doing most crimes on Planet earth 🌏: / []
😮 Great interview! 😢 / []
God bless her she was raped at first meeting. Really wish she had received justice while on the earth.😢 / []
As father of three awesome daughters I am so f'ing angry that I can't sit still I would love to have 1/2 hour with the perps that do these kind of things in a locked room. OMG, I hate this so much! / []
I don't like the way Tara Brown conducted this interview. The tone of her questions are not of someone genuinely trying to understand Virginia. She comes across as judgemental questioning Virginia's decisions and choices. Why did you comply? Why did you accept their proposal? Why didn't  you say anything to anyone?  Virginia tried to explain the best that she could her why.  It seems to me that Tara Brown has no knowledge of how the psyche of a young woman who was molested since age 7, doesn't have the capacity to say no or to look for a way out.  I questioned if Virginia really had options. We have seen the response from the authorities when woman have reported being molested by powerful people. Think Harvey Weinstein. It took years before justice was finally served. for both Weinstein and Epstein. / ['Perhaps the interviewer was asking those questions to give Virginia a lead to enable her to describe the horrors she endured.  Tara did say to Virginia that she was free to say as much or as little as she was able to.', 'I think she asked those questions since the public is very judgmental and they have a habit of blaming the victims.  Most likely she wanted the world to know the reasons behind it.']
My heart breaks for everything this beautiful soul endured. 😞🙏🏻 / []
Wealthy elites praying on commoners through a vast conspiracy of vampirism encompassing financial, mental, and physical abuse. / []

She's a common manipulator; life experiences have taught her exactly what to do.  Even in the photos with the prince, she's full of joy! Later, she used these situations to make millions. I have neither respect nor mercy for her!! / []

The core / []
The questions they're asking are such a nightmare for a trauma survivor. I hope she had a trained professional there to help her through this. Ugh. I can't believe she could even do this interview and these questions. My heart breaks for her. / []

I’m f…ing pissed to hear that “ her services” were only worth $200.00?  Young lady, U were clearly taken advantage of and abused by the twisted Epstein and Maxwell duo. I so wish that you had someone who U could go to and rely on to keep you safe and get U out of that nightmare. / []

7:48 I don’t think this is gullible - we are encouraged to believe ‘making it’ can look like this, but that is on purpose, because it benefits the abusers (as we can see) and doesn’t discourage engaging in the ‘real work force’   Scams only work because there is an aspect of believability since they are working within a framework that’s been legitimized by other ‘good actors’ (at least not wholly bad actors anyways)  Having been previously abused and traumatized and not yet having worked through it, they were even more at risk of giving benefit to the doubt Abuse thrives in the benefit of the doubt And we are traumatized so this can be manipulated further   If this is gullibility, then why didn’t pop pop take pause?   Gullibility puts the onus on us, the community and victims We are led to believe our world is safe and we are not unreasonable to behave as if that is true It is the abusers who are unreasonable for being abusers - child sex traffickers at that, the worst of the worst  What is unreasonable is this was an open secret and a number of well empowered people permitted this to carry on Because ultimately a number of our well empowered people are those sickos or benefiting from it What is unreasonable is that we have those people in our community / []
Who WAS the Prime minister then?? What country? A P.M  is only  a few countries!! / ['Israel']
She was silenced aka taken out / ['Of course.  The question is.. who took her out?']
Yall just now learninng the Elite are corrupt lol.  Money is the root of all evil and why that chic got in over her head.  Her ex BF has a few tales to tell but it dont jive with the agenda BEING pushed, girl wasnt as innocent as fools make her out to be.😊 / []

This man did not experience guilt because he had no empathy / ['Just like our current president. And I’m more and more convinced that Clinton is in the Epstein files too.']

It was so moving interview.  Poor girl!, I cried listening. Though I wish she RIP but she will only RIP when the files are released. / []
I hate she’s no longer here. She deserved better and I hate she didn’t live to see Andrew’s fall. All that money she got and she still did what she did proves mental health is an asset you can’t buy. I pray she’s at peace. / []
Why aren't there other girls coming forward with their own storiies?  Were there boys getting trafficked too? / ["After she was unalived for speaking out.. I doubt anyone will come forward now.   God needs to take over and end these demons.  It's the only way.  Btw, Epstein is 1% of what is going on.  It's way bigger and way scarier.  Yes, there are boys in it too."]
Epstein is horrible / []

the first time i learned about child rape=when Harry interview oprah & her tears were REAL... gillane Not Nice 100% / []
It's not just powerful people that do this.  Men who go to prostitutes abuse women too. Most (if not all) prostitutes have been abused all their life too. I believe that society calling them "sex workers" to make the situation seem more acceptable are also (without realizing) accepting the abuse of women. We need to go after these men powerful or not. / []
I feel so bad for her / []
Where are these kids parents? / []
Maxwell is always slinking around like a guilty cat in the background. / []
Trafficed.  Too nice a word.    My body, my choice, my sanity, my days, my nights, my self respect, my personal identity were sold to rich creepy men is more like it. / []
This is why the elite want to erase GOD. They don’t want to face the fact that they will be accountable to HIM. It is classic 1 Peter 4:4.

Society often let's down the innocent, the corruption, the cowardly, the greedy and the morally laxed selfish people are disgusting human beings, if you can call them that.😶  I was sexually harassed at work and no one spoke up, everybody put on a facade of decency and moral standing but no one spoke up or did the right thing. I get where Virginia Giuffre is coming from, society often let the innocent down.  My heart hurts for Virginia Giuffre and my stomach churns with pain for all that she has had to go through in most of her lifetime. Even the "husband" she met in Thailand from Australia ended up abusing her, he beat her to a pulp and once again where were her friends and family and her younger brothers grown up by the time of this interview did not protect her either. Shaking my head at all these people in her life, they all failed her.  Why were her parents not there for her, why did they never develop a relationship or a bond with Virginia, how can a family friend abuse her from the age of 7-11, that is 4 years, were her parents deaf dumb and blind?   Throughout the whole interview Virginia explained herself well but there seems to be a disconnect which is totally understandable, I don't think Virginia knew that she was traumatized and the interviewer is pretty cold, didn't even hand Virginia a tissue when tears streamed down her face, she just wanted to get to the meat of the story.  Too many cowards in the world and not enough courageous people to keep society accountable and decent.  The operative sentence was 12 yrs old, Trump said that was his maximum age that he will not go under for women. All these nasty ugly horny men with money and power destroying so many lives. 😢  Epstein was definitely a sex addict, for him to have the urge to have sex every 2 hrs, that is a sex addict but he also knew how to be a high class pimp in order to make money and to use blackmail to protect himself as a pedophile. Ghislaine Maxwell is one cold evil b*TCH, I hope she and all the pedophiles burn in hell😈, may karma come to get them all.  Too many pedophiles with money and power protecting the other pedophiles. Society and the people need to rise up until the Epstein files are released. All the nasty pedophiles need to be held accountable. From the professors, politicians, doctor's, lawyers and Prince Andrew that nasty piece of shit is 💯 % guilty for having sex with a minor(Virginia Giuffre) Sarah Ferguson(Prince Andrew's wife) knew it but turned a blind eye, the nasty wench was paid off by Epstein. I know Alan Dershowitz is an Epstein customer for sure, why else would the old shriveled prune threaten Virginia so hard? No way can an Epstein lawyer(Alan Dershowitz) get massages from really young girls at Epstein's mansion and not have had sex with the girls. Alan Dershowitz admitted he got massages from the young girls. Virginia's lawyers should not have backed down, they did Virginia an Injustice by backing down from that nasty old prune Alan Dershowitz(I am sorry that is all I see everytime Alan Dershowitz's face shows up anywhere in the news).  Virginia Giuffre was killed for sure, how the bus hit her car and then she died at home, I think her husband was pressured into killing her. You can tell that she had always held hope in her heart that people would do the right thing by her and that she wanted to be happy. I think the fact that she was a tomboy when she was young is what got her through all the horrific circumstances in her life.  Society can still redeem themselves by globally fighting for the 1000s of Epstein victims. Make it an epic pandemic of social support, keep talking about it on all social media outlets. Share any and all information that you can on the Epstein victims and pedophiles, especially name names and post pictures of the all the nasty pedophiles, that is the least society can do now for the victims.  And parents pls form a relationship and bond with your kids and don't let your kids be alone with adults, yes even with friends and other family members, always make sure they are with you and talk to them about the dangers of the world, child sex traffickers, drugs and bullies and show them what to do and how to avoid or get out of those situations and how to collect evidence. A sock has DNA, a pair of undies, sheets, don't shower and get a rape test done, all the steps to take, if you don't know it, google it and learn it so you can protect your kids.  As for bullies, parents can always file a harrassment case against any bullies, yes even underaged kids to the police, have them and the parents charged if the bullying does not stop, online or physically. Talk to your kids on a friend's level and always ask them if they are being bullied or approached inappropriately.  I am just really angry everytime I hear injustices, when there is an Injustice, that means society is not doing their job. / []
RIP VIRGINIA ❤ / []
Maybe u should not taken Bate ? Most women don’t really think about things before they do it? Maybe money / []
Comments open?! 🎉 / []
Politician, professor and even royalty..the elites of the world.  Hearing her say she thought of ending her life is haunting.

Naomi Campbell was most likely a victim of trafficking I suspect, aside from being a fashion model. She could have been passed around to industry higher ups. She thought it was the norm for a teenage girl to be trafficked at an adult party. So didn’t bat an eyelash. / []

Her husband probably thought he had some right to treat her the way he did!! And I am really sorry she carried that burden inside her and didn’t just leave his ugly ass!! / []

I doNOT believe she committed suicide. She was murdered and it was made to look like suicide. She was too outspoken. RIP beautiful soul. Your authenticity shines so very bright. ❤❤❤ / ['We need to uncocer the murders statrting with names VG mentioned.', 'Other accusers have died under strange circumstances as well', 'I agree with you 💯', 'I agree ☝️ even though the circumstances point that “she couldn’t see her kids, so she committed su*cide” I disagree. All her young life Virginia fought dragons, she didn’t end her life as a survivor of Epstein and Maxwell abuse, and she died in suspicious circumstances. Virginia would not have died because she couldn’t see her kids, it was engineered by those in power to make her look unhinged towards the end of her life. RIP VIRGINIA GIUFFRE', 'She didn’t commit suicide. It was a planned murder']

I hate my big brother.  He molested us. My sister continued the abuse with me.  How do you go on?. / []

Never ask the details of one’s abuse. Especially publicly  Never question why a victim took the actions or made the decisions  they did. PLEASE, mass media and 60 Minutes, educate yourselves on trauma-informed interviewing techniques and power and control dynamics of abusive relationships.  She does not need to justify herself for the salacious appetites of viewers. Where is the 60 Minutes interview of her abuser? Of the interview of the law enforcement agencies that FAILED her and so many others? / ['good point, but again thinking about it,  this was a very difficut interview to conduct', "What a ridiculous take on this. Obviously an interview for 60 minutes is going to be public. Obviously there are going to be questions. This isn't a therapy session. Virginia wanted to discuss this. Nobody forced her to give this interview and bring lawsuits and write books. She wanted to share her story. Instead of shaming the interviewer you should be praising Virginia for having the courage to share her story. She made a brave choice. Why are you refusing to accept that? She was a strong woman who wanted to use her voice. Why are you acting like she was a fragile glass unicorn who should have been too ashamed to do this interview? I think YOU acting like women need to be ashamed and passive about their stories is a big part of the problem.\xa0Why do you have trouble with strong women speaking out?\n\nAnd obviously the police and her abusers aren't going to agree to an interview. Do you think 60 Minutes frog marches everyone to interviews at gunpoint? People get to CHOOSE whether they want to appear on 60 Minutes. I don't think you understand how interviews work at all."]
It's hardly surprising that as a 14yo she complied, given her previous experience of having been abused. Tragic. / []

she was surrounded by vipers. RIP Virginia / []
comparing herself to a bottle of champagne you’d share with your friends at a dinner party.. the trauma is unbelievable / []
I'm currently listening to her book on Audible. Her quest for accountability was not in vain. Thank you, Virginia! Honesty is what saves us all from darkness. RIP 🙏 / []
This gorgeous, brave young woman is describing ***classic predatory grooming techniques*** And predators have a sick sense how to seek out victims, especially those who’ve been victimized previously  Unfortunately this young woman was preyed upon and exploited by highly skilled abusers. And they continued to victimize thousands (not hundreds) of young people even after authorities were involved. Sex trafficking isn’t new, nor human trafficking is any form, but it’s finally being exposed. / []
Jeffrey Epstein was a ISRAEL Asset for blackmail... Is so sad all the disgusting things all these people did to those poor little girls and nobody has paid for what they did... So so sad.. / ['Where is your proof? Why did you like your own comment?']
Virginia’s deep emotion carries so strongly in this interview. And the interview is the interviewer is so skillful and yet gentle. / []
And then her husband kept abusing her my god that poor young lady all monsters in her life. / []
Why wouldn’t she out the family friend?? She wants to hold Epstien accountable but not the people that actually abused her! Makes no sense??? As soon as I realized who abused me I outed him to anyone that would listen I wanted him held accountable I wanted people to know who he was and what he did so people would stay away from him and keep young girls away from him! She makes no sense as an adult that she wants to sit and talk about all the abuse but not hold the abuser accountable. She was happy to name Andrew for cash why won’t she name the others? She was looking for a free ride and easy out that is why she went back. She had a job at Maralogo and she didn’t want to work for her education she wanted someone to pay for it and she was willing to let them do to her what they did the first day to get them to pay for it. I was in foster care at age nine and abused more times than I can count but the one thing that rang thru my head was my grandfather saying nothing is for free kid you have to work for everything! A counselor told me your life will only be what you make of it! / []
This is one reason why we can't let the extremely rich rule.They think they they can do whatever the F,they want! / ['Why are you obsessed with rich people? How much makes someone rich?

There’s a nuance to this story that we don’t hear about anymore for some reason. The first word about this was about a stranger that was driving through Virginias family neighborhood looking for Virginia and asking residents where she lived, some youngsters told her where Virginia lived.  Was that stranger  “Maxwell” and why isn’t the neighbor who reported the woman stalker not speaking about it to the media now? / []
This interviewer is very cold / []
Something does not square.  She wanted to be a massage therapist but was never in a massage room ????????? / []

Amazing interview. Virginia was a brave woman to withstand what she went thru and be a voice for justice. What a horrific journey. / []
The depths of human behaviour and total corruption. But this has been going on for Millenniums. / []
Wow, I’m so sad for her and her family she loves. I don’t care which political party is responsible, just open the files now. This needs to be done so we can learn how to stop this evil. / []
She was suicided, she did not commit suicide. / []
I have watched lots of sex crimes on Forensic Files and FBI episodes. Sex criminals prey only on lonely vulnerable victims. So Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell just preyed up Virginia Giuffre.  Well President Trump likely preyed on young girls as well. There may be very damaging evidence in the Epstein files that the DOJ has. Since there is no ;limit on the statute of limitations of sex trafficking he could be charged at any time. It would be great if he could be charged and found guilty of sex trafficking.  So said for Virginal Giuffre that she committed suicide because of all the abuse. So said she could rise above the pain and bad memories. / []
Now that Im hearing about the details...what is with her parents?  why didnt her father get his own 'red flags' feeling as he took his own deeply harmed child to the door of a stranger and leave her there?  Virginia did NOT get a normal or in any way ok childhood.  Her family, her schools, her neighbours, was there no one who picked up on her behaviour changes?  No one who asked why?  no one to help her grow and heal far far earlier?  Everyone failed Virginia.  Everyone. / []
There is no way that someone could have been a friend of Epstein for more than a day and not have been involved in his behaviour at all,,  and Ghislaine Maxwell needs to be checked on that she is actually inside her prison and not secretly coming and going, I don't believe them , they put her in a celebrity jail how corrupt in our face can they get , sickening for the victims, pray for them / []
I'm noticing that both of these ladies' next have turned red. Isn't that a sign of how upset or angry they / []
Poor soul… / []
I don't believe she took her own life. / []
Wow!!!  Common Sense Really!! / []
Am just sick - these people are monsters and should be punished for their crimes, Maxwell should get a longer and more difficult sentence / []
Such a tragedy...at the hands of abusive, manipulative, rotten people. It's unfathomable. She was so brave, articulate and so gracious after being abused by monsters. Such a loss. May her strength live on to help those who need to be rescued from human trafficking. / []
She wasn’t kidnapped. She was hired. / []
Why does she name only one offender? Even in her book, even when she knew she was dying, she aparently told her publisher to ensure the book is put out there, but no information about who the multiple offenders are. This cryptic mention of unnamed offenders, but she had no problem naming Andrew, the one that could pay the most. I remain sceptical because she is not transparent / []
JUSTICE / []
💔 / []
🖤 / []
Slow it down to 0.25 speed at the 28:00 mark to see the age gap between the victim and the predators. The Epstein files need to be released and the coverup needs to end! / []
When you are abused you often don’t tell because for some stupid reason , you feel partly to blame even though you did nothing to feel guilty about.  Only people who have been subject to such abuse understand that. / []
I so understand this poor woman.  When women are abused as a child, they end up feeling soiled and not deserving of a good partner . So with such a low self esteem, they often  end up in abusive relationships. / []
Could it be that Trump is hiding the files to protect the other perpetrators, who are wealthier...more influential...more dangerous than he is? His own reputation is already crap...get go any lower.  But the others?????  I'd say it's his mission to keep their names out of it...or else! / []
What a heartbreaking story. It all started with her parents. Some of you who have read the book said that it was her father who abused her when she was seven. Can’t he be brought to justice? / []
In her book, she reveals that her childhood abuser was her own father. / []
Why is this reporter so heartless?? / []
If Trump commutes Ghislane Maxwell's sentence, he should be immediately impeached and removed from office for abuse of power.  She is one of the most prolific abusers of young girls in modern history. / []
May she rest in peace❤ / []
did Virginia's parents get paid? They are still out there Virginia. Thank you for all you did to expose the "elite" we know who they are even though they won't be brought to justice in this life, hell awaits. / []
When you hear the whole thing her honesty is what blew the whole thing. When we ask questions sometimes we don’t want to hear the answer. It’s hard to hear but it something we need to hear. So many people failed her. So many systems. Then people wonder why people are running away. / []
Yes. I am not sure i believe  she killed hersrlf. Seems implausible  that she had children and would di that.  Did her husband abuse her, too, finally? I think the WHOLE truth will come out soon. / []
I hope her three kids are proud of their Mom! / []
Sorry for your experience. Praying for you . Everything gonna be alright / []
And the elephant in the room is now the POTUS. 10 years close friend of Jeffrey Epstein. / []
There is so much emphasis on the files but no one is even mentioning the vault. / []

I was approached by a young gypsy woman once to sell myself in exchange for millions of money. Only trillionaires could afford that amount. I feel this story is eye-opening / []
Been like it for centuries---look up BEGGARS BENISON or EDINBURGH WIG CLUB and that is only Scotland! / []
Didn’t her parents check on her? / ['Right … where tf were they at !?!?']
Meanwhile, Israel killed Charlie Kirk, Congress voted to cover up Epstein the same day, and Trump showed the world that he's the Antichrist. / []
And then Andrew did everything to destroy your life even in Australis / []
Why didn’t name the relative and get justice for that / []
Omh. What a story! it is totally believable that this beautiful  woman and lovely young girl was so insufferably abused. The truth WILLCcome out! So sorry her want to die finally caughtxup with her, above her amazing will to live....so sad. Sad. Sad. Sad. Heartbreaking entirely. / []
All the famous people that will go down seems disgusting....May she RIP and  find Peace! / []
I HATE having to hear this incredible woman’s words from beyond the grave. F Epstein. F Maxwell. F Andrew. / ['F Donald.']
Didn’t her parents watch her at all..They targeted vulnerable children..I blame the parents.. / []
Great interview. / []
I just watched for the first time. Can't wait to read the book. I can't believe that she took her own life. If she was a Mom, she didn't kill herself. This was done by Trump during the shutdown bc he knows he can't let Mike Johnson open the government until she was taken care of before the Epstein files are released. Why has this news not been on American Media like crazy?! Virginia was a fighter! She did not kill herself. Her family only cares about keeping the government away from them so they will go along with anything. This is deeply sad. I am furious and want this on the American News! Nobody is talking about this! / []
bumped off / []
Justice for all!… release epstein files!!! / []
It’s just so sad she isn’t in this world any more.  I hope she realizes the huge difference she made.  Rest in peace Virginia, hope these POS are brought to justice.  Hopefully karma finds their addresses. / []
So, Naomi Campbell is involved with this.  She's part of Diddy's sex scandal as well.  I have lost all respect for her! / []

You can't charge the perpertraitors without evidence and if someone is not willing to give evidence there is no case."]
Awful for her.  I wonder why, though, she only went after Prince Andrew and none of the other “lots and lots of” men?  If they all had money and prestige, it just seems strange she has only named one. / []
It's unfair that prince Andrew never paid for his deeds / []
Yet she only went after one man🤔 / ["She couldn't. Her life was at stake. That photo she had of Andrew exposed him, she didn't verbally expose him.", 'Still a grifter.']
So 😢sad that she's gone / []
Yes  and she said Politicians      wow / []
Anyone who has not been a victim of sexual abuse, especially as a child, cannot comprehend how deeply it seeps into your psyche.  When she said “You feel like you have the word Victim emblazoned on your forehead”, that’s EXACTLY how it feels.  Even after years of freedom, if someone suddenly treats you in that way it all comes back.  You feel tainted and labeled and put in your defined role. / ["It's so hard to have any kind of recovery from this kind of abuse...it happens over and over again...new face, same shit. I have never really recovered...old now and it still colors my life.😔", 'I understand everything she says because my daughter went through abuse and thought it was normal to be used \u200b@janetheckmann5859', 'The predators see the invisible ink immediately.']
Bless her soul, I hope she is free now. may the truth come to be know NOW / []
😢😢😢 / []
I pray that if our Prime Minister Carney in Canada has used the Epsteins' services (we have photos of him and his wife attending events with Maxwell), that he will face real consequences. / []
Yes psychologists could be involved / []
Even if she was aware of what was happening, even if she was told before and she agreed, those evil abusers deserves capital punishment. She was underage: full stop. / []
I’m not sure if it’s just me… I know that there is supposed to be some semblance of detachment so that you can stay focused on interviewing the person but this interviewer has an air of smugness to her and coldness to her. That is so disturbing to me. There is a level of Well you should’ve known in her tone and this smirk facial expression as she gives that makes me feel another layer of pain for this woman who has to relive all of this horrific encounters all over again in front of someone that seems to have no empathy and an air of conversation to her. / []
For those who haven't experienced sexual assault, it's honestly wild how the body reacts. I never thought it would happen to me, and I did say no and I did say I would hit him, but as soon as I knew he had power over me, I went in to survival mode and essentially froze.  It doesn't always play out how you think you'd react. / []
There is no way she took her life. / []
R I P.  You are in a better place without injustice, without abuse / []
I think Epstein came back into her life.   After the marriage. / []
They murdered this girl. She never killed herself at all.  There demons in the flesh. Im sick of them all.  They want something to go away, death follows them. / []
RIP to this sweet lady. 😢😢😢 / []
RELEASE THE FILES!!! Ugh! This breaks my heart! How can you not want justice for these ladies! No matter who’s on that list, we need justice!! / []
Where the hell were her parents. / []
Was she killed / ['Definitely', 'I think so.']
Virginia never had her voice heard in this country.  When you hear her story, it becomes so real, so authentic and so tragic.  Sadly it is just one of many. / []
She was in danger. She said so. I believe she was kxlxed / []
I THINK EPSTEIN SCUMBAG IS STILL ALIVE THEY CREATED A DRAMA TO SHOW THE WORLD HE IS GONE HOWEVER HE IS PROBABLY LIVING WITH FAKE ID IN SOME ISLAND & DOING SAME CRAP / ['🎯', 'I really hope not!']
Who groomed you because I'm seeing a lot of this Marism Cult trash with all the Epstien stuff.  The people that groomed you need to be tracked. / []
They killed her. For sure. It hasn’t ended with Epstein’s death. / ['☑️']
Yes, She'd probably had a miscarriage 😢 Sounds like they were monitoring her urine / []
RIP Virginia. Karma if nothing else will catch them up. / ['Hebrews 9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:']
Virginia was so brave and clever, she is missing so much now / ['She’s at peace now.']
So how stupid was Epstein to take pictures of them with HER Own Camera? ... perhaps back up to protect himself? / []
Horrible o know what she's been through & she's no more. May her soul rest in peace. / []
Wow this is wild / []
It’ll come out soon enough, nobody is above any laws and law will catch up / []
Such despicable monsters! Unbelievably awful. May they all be punished accordingly. / []
You were so brave. And I am so so sad you left us. 😔 / []
If she was willing to oust all these people why not tell who started all the sexual abuse as a child? She should have told on that person for sure as well / []
20:50 Kristy Noem ACTUALLY kills puppies! If you’re concerned about someone saying it, why are you okay with them actually doing it? And then writing a book and GLOATING about it! She killed her 14 month old puppy and the sheep who was staring at her after she did it. That is mortifying to me! Democrats typically would never hurt an animal. So if someone said something about puppies, it was probably aimed at Kristy Noem / []
Bless Virgnia and I'm sure she is going to get this info, out into the world by working on this from the other side! Other countries will be exposing/sharing the truth with American's soon! / []
Definitely very dumb to go back the 2nd time / []
Now Trump is Swamp. / []
Journalists should never question victims about why they didn't resist. They need to have psychologists who are experts in SA to explain it to the audience. It's shameful the way this interview was handled. / ["No...she just asked the questions we were all thinking. She didn't do it mean spirited."]
The cover-up continues. Where is justice? / []
What do you mean “defeat the democrats” 😂😂 There is no defeating the democrats, they are more than half of the country. And most of them stay quiet and show when they need too. Do you understand that the Government has you focused on democrats so they can steal the government money without any pushback? They have almost wiped out the middle class already. It’s going to be the 1% owning the rest of us if you don’t snap out of it / []
Trump,Andrew and  Fergie were his friends. Ghillaine worked with him. She was their friend too. How the hell can ANYONE be friends with paedo's and think that's okay !!!  The fact that trump released Ghillaine to a more accommodating prison speaks VOLUMES . Why the hell would you do that ??? UNLESS you had something to hide. WE WILL NOT STAY SILENT, WE WILL FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR VIRGINIA AND OTHER VICTIMS. I've always felt that if someone commits a severe crime, and there is CLEAR evidence to prove it, then before they are imprisoned ( into a harsh prison without benefits that some people don't even have that have never committed a crime ), they should be thrown to the parents/families of the victims to do as they wish, if they survive that, then shove them in a prison that does NOT give them a great quality of life. A life that they DENIED their VICTIMS and close family and friends. I for one don't give a damn about their lives, because they didn't give a damn about their victims !! / []
Something tells me, her suicide was not, it was made to look like a suicide. ( My opinion only, no reference other than what I see here in this documentary)  Such a beautiful person that should have been cherished instead of used. / []
Did she finish high school? I’m just curious. / []
I am not sure of the timeline, but didn’t her parents think something was off with her in NY? And you can’t cheat an honest man, i.e. did her parents really think that you “audition” for a massage therapy job without having a license or certification, and that some “nice rich people” are so beneficent? I can see a 16 year old thinking that but 2 adults? Maybe I have watched too much Law and Order! I feel so terrible for her, that a young girl would think of herself as having so little worth. But that’s what these people prey on. Virginia, may you find peace and know you are loved and admired for your bravery. I feel she was right not to disclose the men. Keeping it private i creased her power and their fear. But what a price she paid. / []
Because of this strong ass woman, Andrew is no longer a prince. I wish she could have lived long enough to see that happen. / ["She did a horrible thing to PA and at the end realized it .\nThat's why she's not alive to see it . God is up there .", '\u200b@miramaric4383What are you talking about?', '\u200b@miramaric4383it was the other way  round, andrew did the wrong thing not her.', '@miramaric4383God is up there.... and watching.... As you will find out!!! Hope you like it hot.', '\u200b@miramaric4383wtf are you talking about ?']
So I have a question and Im sorry if it sounds crass or shes already done this but wouldn't it put this whole thing to bed one way or the other if they had done something like asked her to describe their genitals? / []
I don't believe she commented suicide, she was murdered. / ['Why would she comment about it?', '\u200b@JackalKing223 my thoughts exactly, she knew someone wanted her dead.', 'At 42:00 she mentions not putting herself in any more danger by naming names…']
She has been used ever since she was a little girl. Adults in her life failed her horribly. She's an adult but there's this vulnerable, childish vibe about her . She speaks and I see a little girl / []
Why didn't she come forward with all the names? Why only Andrew? / []
I wish she could have explained her parent situation better.  Her father has to have hear something, after all he was working for Trump. / []
I think that they took advantage that her dad was a humble man so when they just said, "She's in good hands, we'll take her home" it probably was off-putting, but he wasn't really in a position to say, "wait a minute,  I'm sorry,  but I'd like to wait for her. How long can the interview be,  right?" He probably thought these are very rich people that could make my daughter's dreams come true, so I don't want to take the chance they'll get upset and not help her. It's sad; he literally handed her off to her abusers. 😢 / []
And so was she. / []
Yes , why is this not being talked about? There are no words I can find after seeing this interview. We must not forget Virginia Giuffre and those like her, who have suffered at the hands of the powerful . / []
she was not held at gunpoint, why did she not escape? she travels freely from one country to another, something is off with most of her claims, Its like, an escort, that she had chosen as her work, and from the photos with andrew, she seemed so excitedly  was there smiling happily, I guess she voluntarily did her job as sex worker, and later she claimed to fame , made up so many of her stories, WHY BLAMED EVERYONE AROUND HERE, THE RICH PEOPLE SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE SEX WITH, WHY NO BLAME FOR HER PARENTS, WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE RESPONSIBLE, I dont buy all her claims, she is in it for the money, sex workers, escorts, they are not being held on gunpoint to service men , they wor\k to earn money, lots of money, traficking is way different that her claims, I highly doubt she was trafficked, this is a plain and simple ,an escirt, that had been paid by her clients, so happened she got into high profile circle. later she saw the opportunity to earn money, after she can no longer work as an escort as she had gotten old, her claims are too shady, Andrew and epstein could have done molestations and all, but the real victim is not this woman. / []
Prince Andrew is a sick person and the royal family cannot get away from his actions by trying to take away his tittle,  what an entitled bunch. LOL what has Camilla have to say about the matter? happy families now then huh! / []
If she's not going to name names and why does she on here / []
she should be here today. they sucked the joy, innocence and life out of her until she couldn't fight anymore. an eternal injustice / []
The interviewer did an impeccable job. I don't think she works for Fox/Mark Levin News. / []
The Epstein files will never be released. The tiny hats who are always getting involved in sex scandals, particularly ones involving minors, will make sure they protect each other and themselves. Epstein was a scapegoat / []
"I don't think anyone will ever face consequences" that is who 'god will juge you' is for. Not for putting fear into good people. It is a promise that god will have justice / []
RELEASE THE FILES!!!! / []
STOP PROTECTING THE PEDOPHILES. Release the Epstein Files and get justice for the victims & survivors. RIP Dear Virginia. Your life & death should not be in vain. / ['Fr anyone protecting the pedos is just as bad and looks guilty AF too whole lot of ducks quacking', "The files you want to see are sealed because the Obama DOJ gave Epstein a sweetheart deal that gave his co conspirators immunity.  The pe dos have been protected since then.  I don't believe that list will ever see the light of day.  Any evidence has undoubtedly been destroyed.", "I don't know why those two liberal judges denied President Trump's request to release ALL files on Epstein.  Makes me so mad.  Who are they protecting?", '\u200b@joshcarmichael5596Destroyed or tampered with.  Thank goodness forensics can make the determination as to whether or not that has been done.']
I don’t believe everything she’s said, things may have happened but she’s absolutely embellished a lot / []
Did she really commit suicide? She had an awful lot of information to reveal that would have put a lot of men in prison. 🤔🤷‍♀️ / []
Her husband is a martial arts person so how could she attack him / []
Exactly WHY was Ghislane Maxwell transferred to a POSH facility? Pamela can you answer please? / []
I am sorry she has died, and that she took her own life... rest in peace! But ... of course it is a very corrupt world. Specially amongst politicians and very powerful people with money. However, she was very much into the sex business since very early in her life. Since the beginning  she played along with the Epstein's demands and she even scouted her school friends to follow her up. She kept going back, her father drove her to the airport on numerous occassions. If what the consequences of her behaviour caughtup with her while growing older specially because the sex appeal was no longer there as a young woman ... the book and the lawsuits had to be convenient. / []
Groomed to the Max! Poor Virginia my heart breaks for her and her family! 😢 / []
No one deserves what this young lady went through. May she rest in peace. / []
listening to this interview is heartbreaking, and the fact that maxwell has been shuffled into this low security prison and given preferential treatment by the trump doj is horrible and reprehensible / []
So she sat tgeircwith husband on tv and never said a word about her abuse and police didn't believe her so we arevto believe that Andrew had s with her 3vtimes I'm not backing Andrew but why hasn't her husband being looked into / []
Demonic is what is behind Epsteins, Maxwell, Weinstein and Royals...not just British Royals. Twisted lot. / []
THANKS PAM BONDI - for your devotion to the law and justice. May you someday ROT in a prison, perhaps you'll go over the files there? America knows what you are, same as George Zimmerman does. / []
She doesn't want to talk about the person who robbed her of her innocence and childhood and who subsequently continued to abuse her but she will openly out and destroy an english prince who slept with her at 17!!! Wtf / []
She wanted too do as she please and she was after money. I cannot feel sorry for her. / []
Pam Bondi has the file on her desk. She is this country's top law enforcement official, and paid QUITE WELL. / []
So the father drops her off and leaves her there alone / []
I felt heartbroken for you, Virginia. How come the parents turned a blind eye to what had been happening to their daughter??? I’m so sorry for you…. It shouldn’t have happened never to anyone… what a nightmare. And they killed her….  RIP Virginia. I do hope that one day  the justice will win. / []
This is an explosively revealing, sadly sickening to the stomach interview I have ever seen knowing this warrior women is no more. / []
It's weird to know the Trump cabinet applauds all this, and covers for it. They actually say Jeffry Epstein did not exist, and those saying things are making it all up. This is our current "leadership". / []
I think she didn t die of suicide. Since Princess Diana we know what happens to folks who speak up against the british monarchy... / []
Oh my goodness 💔 / []
IMA BE HINEST & STR8 HERE...OBVIOUSLY JEFFREY EPSTEIN & GHILLAINE ARE EVIL ABUSERS...NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER...BUT THE GIRLS HOLD SOME RESPONSBILTY ASWELL...NOT THE ONES THAT JUST GOT ABUSED 1 TIME & IT WAS A 1 TIME OCCURENCE BUT THE ONES THAT WENT BACK AGAIN & AGAIN OBVIOUSLYYY THERE WAS SOME INNER GREED THERE & NOT SAYING THEY WERE ENJOYING IT BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES ASWELL... / []
Rest in peace Virginia 🙏  Andrew's mother paid £12 million to this poor woman, why would anyone pay 12 million to someone who they never met...apparently, he's wrong un for sure.  The monarchy should be abolished. / []
Her parents failed her. / []
Loved this interview. Absolutely hate the subject. I tried a couple times to Like it it it won’t let me. I preordered her book / []
What's jarring is that there may be others that are clandestinely still in operation, with young girls and boys trapped in that world. / ['👆🏾💯💯💯💯‼️‼️‼️', "Without a doubt! No question about it! It's absolutely still going on", 'probably a few million just in the west', 'Middle 3ast as well,I saw more prostitution in middle east than any where else I have been.15 years working over there.Bahrain and Dubai was rife in most hotels ,even 5 star hotels. Was also ex RAF and travelled a lot around the world.']
The fact this is coming out now is a crime against humanity......never forget / []
And then Trump said, “Epstein?! Why is anybody still talking about him? He is dead!” Yeah, ok… / []
12 yr. Old models!  🤯😡 / []
Rest in peace Virginia. The world is less without your courage. / []
Rest in peace, brave soul. / []
Poor girl. Evil exists.  Some with power and money are animals.  May she rest in peace. / []
Thank you for doing this interview.  I just want to ask which bible did that fakey Christian we have as speaker of the house use to be sworn to uphold our laws with?  Proof that he doesn't honor it or his job.  He seems to think it's Guardian Of Pedophiles. / []
Virginia didn't trust those two, she had CPTSD and no boundaries through mind control trauma programming.  Why did her dad allow her to be abused at 7 till 11 and how did he not know he was placing her into more depravity.  She didnt have a chance / []
Wait. White House spokeswoman Teen Angel explained this is all a hoax. There never was a Jeffrey Epstein. The entire Trump cabinet nodded in agreement before returning to looking over their wealth portfolios. / []
Where were her parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, grandparents, cousins, friends and everybody else? It's not like she was a child but she was a teenager. / []
Just so sad and tragic for all of those who have been hurt by predators. RIP Virginia.😢 / []
We must remain consistent with trying to get the epstein files released, don't let MAGA distract or deter us. / []
I sent this from 2019? / []
This is years older then YouTube reports / []
Did she ever said more famous name? I am sad she can't see what happening now / []
What a sad tale of woe, and one of the worst parts about it is that the FelonOdious one thought so much of EpStain and Ghislaine Maxwell at that time and probably still does. In fact, Dumbty's moved Ghislaine Maxwell from the high security prison she belongs in for the rest of her life to a cushy Prison and is even planning to Pardon her when the "Coast is Clear"? This despicable, fascistic murderer is just as bad as EpStain and Maxwell, even if he can show that he didn't participate in anything beyond lusting after his own 12 year old daughter and having sex with Melatonia in EpStain's Lolita Express Airplane when he first met her. Of course, we all know that the fact that he hasn't released the EpStain files and/or videos- is because his name is all over them just like the thoughts he expressed in his 50th Birthday card. Lastly, do you suppose your Ex-prince andrew will be motivated to kill himself because he's now lost his dignity, titles, free home, and has to arrange his own dolls on his bed from now on? Not likely, and so the measure of his losses could never even approach poor Virginia Giuffre's life of misery!!! We Hold Virginia Giuffre and all of the other Children these perverts molested in His Light. / []
Poor Love. / []
I don’t believe Epstein took his own life. / []
RELEASE THE FILES 😭 / []
Anyone who ignore Epstein type of behavior is criminal / []
I can not belief this lady did suicide / []
What I didn't hear in this interview is the name Donald Trump. Which is odd. / []
Every adult in her life failed her, and then the country failed her. Rip / []
We should remember that Reaganomics was all about taking assistance to the poor out of public hands and putting it into private hands. The GOP built up these expectations of the wealthy and their businesses, pure entities that were so self regulated they didn't need laws or taxation to curb their excess so why wouldn't a young girl trust anyone rich who came along and made an offer. To be rich was to be virtuous and so no surprise a lot of those poor girls were so easily taken advantage by the rich and their bait and switch schemes. As we can see by Trump's behavior, these people think they are better than everyone and above the law. As such they are subject to no criticism. Many of these victims were conservative voters and even voted for Trump completely unaware that they were throwing themselves right into the fire. / []
May your soul rest in peace Virginia ❤. You are freed from pain and suffering now. / []
I feel so sad and sorry for Virginia, her whole life she was used and abused! She was not protected, listened to or backed up by anyone, even when she officially reported it! Every single system failed her and so many others that were being passed around like pieces of meat, utterly heartbreaking 💔 😢.  I pray she rests in peace and that justice will catch up to ALL those who enabled, covered up and participated in this horrific abuse!  Sincere love and support to her family and all of the victims fighting for the day the dam breaks and the EPSTEIN FIlES are released! 💜🙏💜🙏💜.  R.I.P beautiful courageous Lady 💜🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🙏💜 / []
thank you for keeping this story alive / []
OMG her pain is so palpable. I'm having a hard time getting through this. I didn't realize she was gone... What a sad, sad tragedy. 😢 / []
such a sad story, but so maddening that those who perpetrated this insanity have not been brought to justice. / []
Virginia should be here today and should have had the JUSTICE she deserved!!!! / []
She was so professional in this interview, vice being nasty and giving details and names she stated she stands by her court documents.  How anyone could not believe this beautiful woman is beyond me. / []
I wish I could have saved her….she deserved a better life / []
It is painfully real.  Bless Ms Guiffre.  May the angels watch over Virginia through eternity . May  Virginia’s children , siblings and those who truly cared for Virginia be shone with grace / []
The very first time this angel of a woman was “trafficked” was by Ghislaine Maxwell to her partner  Jeffrey Epstein. The trafficking started the moment Maxwell invited her for “the interview”. May God bless this woman’s family for fighting for justice after her suspicious death. She has served this nation and this world with integrity in her last days. And none of should brush it off or forget it. / []
A child or teen is not equipped to know what to do to get out of the situation (1st encounter with Maxwell and Epstein) / []
I am not a perfect mother by any means. Having said that, my kids weren’t allowed on a school field trip without me.  I hope her soul is directing things from the other side. / []
Most heartbreaking that she protects her father the whole interview...the man who taught her for years how to live in hell...here you can see how much family loyalty is confused with crime when it comes to abuse. It makes everything even worse...and what most people don t understand...abuse destroys all your boundaries instantly. For lifetime. You don t even feel them anymore. Numb. / []
My ❤ breaks for Virginia and all girls, women, boys, men who have been abused.  They were innocent.  I was violated by a family member but I also cannot pinpoint my age.  I did tell my mom and she beat the living shit out of that person.  He never touched me again and he never apologized.  I'm 65. / []
Epstein: "suicide", Brunel: "suicide", Giuffre: "suicide" / []
Sad this beautiful woman had to go through this shit. I wish I had daughter like her.  I woulda protected you my sweet girl. R Ip / []
The CIA. And other groups including know Biden FBI. Hollywood the so called elite s what joke they are.  Are all involved with trafficking of children and adults. Human trafficking has been going on for thousands years iIT MUST STOP NOW BTHE ELITES ALL THEM HAAVE TO GO.   WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE / []
Do not ever share your trauma with anyone. I mean no one. / []
All the elites and anyone with authority. / []
That male in Naomi party black and pink dress combination is not he catholic? / []
*RIP~VIRGINIA!*   The allege abuse by her husband is alarming as heck! Him taking her children from her was the straw that broke her back. RIP Beautiful Lady. Parents teach your children to be aware of the evil intentions of some adults, even in your own family/circle. WYKYK / []
Two questions….1. Why didn’t you say no when you realized what was expected.   2. Why did you continue to take these trips because after the first time you knew what was going on? / []
I could be wrong, but she made lots of money sleeping with those man, than she became a victim by exposing everyone for money… ( very risky game) wasn’t enough that she received $20 million dollars… she had to write a book!!!!! More and more money… simple life it’s beautiful simple / []
Parents need to teach their children better! / ['You cant give what you dont have']
Pure evil!!! / []
42:20 And yet they tell us that this dude only trafficked to himself. Yet all of his victims have said he had clients who harmed them, but they had the nerve to officially gaslight us all and say we're ridiculous for caring. I believe Giuffre and the other survivors. It wasn't just E or M. / []
Don't forget lawyers / []
THEY DISTROYED  THESE GIRLS DREAMS ,HOPE & FUTURE  NOW MAKE ALL THEM " OLD THUGS PAY THEM ALL" & MAKE IT WORTH THE PAIN  SHAME & SUFFERING  THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH  😢😢😢 / []
This is so difficult to listen to and to watch the pain in her eyes! Oh dear God please let her be with you right now where You wipe away all her tears and sorrow 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 / []
This is horrific beyond words. / []
200 usd! !! Escort girls receive what! So he even planned not to pay enough that she cant save money for runaway .. more than criminals / []
Did no one tell Virginia that becoming a massage therapist wasn't that difficult? Not like becoming a doctor or lawyer. Human beings always gravitate to what is familiar even if its a poor choice unfortunately. There's a possibility Virginia wasn't being honest about her first encounter with maxwell and Epstein. / []
The reason she 'complied' was fear for her life - Had she run instead she may not have survived ........  Her body froze.  Not all men are bad  Many are though..... / []
It’s hard for people that have not experienced psychopaths to imagine how it actually feel to be in their grip 😔 all the pieces of you are shattered 😔 and it stays in your psyche for a very long time. It takes a lot to actually heal ❤ rip Virginia / []
I can’t believe you’re not here to see the impact you’ve made. I hope your pain is gone now. I hope your soul is happy and free. 🫂 / []
What does she mean “were you vulnerable?” All kids are vulnerable. They have no recourse and no way of fighting back. In most cases they also don’t have the language or wherewithal to put what’s happened into words. / []
What a dumb question, all kids are vulnerable. / []
The top of society is not much different than the bottom of society. We should stop looking up to and admiring these people. Virginia is incredibly brave to share her story. I don't think anyone believe she took her own life. Tragic. / []
Naomi is looking right at her, considering the modeling industry abuse, she must’ve known. How sad that she didn’t inquire. / ['Naomi was a huge part of it']
A world full of devils. / []
What an incredible woman! / []
Horrendously heartwrenching interview 😢 / []
She was murdered , rip virginia ❤ / []
As we all know Virginia's life was taken and not by her own hand. The poor girl knew too much. RIP sweet angel / []
This poor girl. It’s absolutely heartbreaking, super disturbing and these people are evil. The trauma is so deep / []
Exonerated whistleblower who exposed goldschmidt and the loveless fosterhome rape ring in Salem Oregon 1990. Still fighting for justice. . So sad. / []
Thank you for sharing this interview. / []
😢 / ['These were underage children, the truth needs needs to be heard and those responsible held accountable.']
RIP Virginia,we know you didn't do it to yourself. / ['We need to do something, otherwise we are enablers', '@BakarooDrop Yeah they still play MJ on the radio.....', "\u200b@BakarooDropwhat can we do? We've got payed army,police and unpaid law upholders between us and the evil😢", '@PaulFormentosthere was no evidence and none of the stories were true with MJ. He was the victim. Don’t compare this with MJ.']
11:48 She was highly taken advantage of. I understand every poor decision that she made, she was failed. Bless her soul 🕊️🙏🏾 / []
She should of wrote a letter with all the names.....girls names everything......and send it too as many journalists as possible. I can t imagine this trauma ......why did she not rebel it is truly astonishing.   It s sickening ...how awful. Names and names and names ......It s hard to understand why would someone put up with this really ......so many occasions to scream for help and failed.....Continued and continued the saga why ....after so much pain 😢😢😢 Soooo many occasions to record something on the phone a conversation a short video run to police astonishing why they put up with this for soon long and  go buy clothes  you know why going to parties you know why......why going at all . When you realise you ve been naive run away....oh gosh it s hard to listen to so many questions s here and so hard to understand in a way. Sorry !!!! 😞 / []
Ok so she named Andrew , but why has she not named any of the other men who abused her / []
“ and i never once considered leaving.  Because of the money …” / ['?????  Why didn’t she leave ?   She eas not kidnapped or held against her will.']
I have read her book.Its so sad / []
Her death is totally suspicious 😮😢 / []
It’s heartbreaking and shocking to hear  Virginia Giuffre’s terrifying sexual abuses in the hands ofJeffrey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell.  From Epstein’s and Maxwell’s sex trafficking ring and to those who were complicit in the covering up of this horrific crime is beyond belief.  But most unfortunate of all, is the number of people in high status involved politically, economically,  in the entertainment industry and the  profession to be considered as Epstein’s and Maxwell’s elite clientele, or not reporting these sexual assaults.  But most of all, is Virginia’s father who sold his minor daughter to these sexual assault perverts for $200.00?  Oh Lord, help us to make sense of all of this!  All these people should be arrested, I don’t care who you are!  Donald Trump and his sycophants should be arrested for their involvement in this sex ring, afterall, it started in Maralago where Virginia Giuffre was introduced. / []
I’m sorry, but what kind of people require their own “traveling masseuse”?  Clearly, Maxwell and Epstein were trying to normalize evil behavior. / []
Leave out the rich and powerful in the beginning of Virginia’s story and you are hearing what every survivor of CSA and CPTSD experiences. From not being able to pin down what precise year the abuses occurred to feeling like there is a victim tattoo on our foreheads that only abusers can see… 😢 / []
Things like this are overlooked,BUT if you give a wrong info to the CENTERLINK, THEY THREATEN YOU  WITH JAIL,  NO MERCY! 😊 / []
Heartbreaking and so believable, so real, so truthful, RIP Virginia and my thoughts are with all the survivors of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. / []
Giuffre died by suicide at her home in Neergabby, Western Australia, on April 25, 2025. Why are you showing this interview now. Let her rest in peace. / []
Maxwell is a evil human being. 🇬🇧 / []
She wasn't sui cidal at all. / []
She was murdered by trumps crew / []
Parallels my own life. I totally understand her. / []
I need to know more about her parents. Her dad dropped her off and I heard nothing else about them. As a minor how did they get so much control. They took her out of the state, she wasn't enrolled in school and she never enrolled into massage school. I heard all this and it was all so depressing that people like this exist, but were all these parents in so many stories I hear. Many parents need accountability, maybe it will stop. Maybe if ppl can support their kids ppl should not have children....We have to be more logical about life. / []
Evil lives amongst us. RIP Virginia. Release the files. Justice must prevail. / []
Until the list is released and the entire list of people charged and convicted, I'm just going to assume all extremely rich people are either on the list or were aware of the list and enabled the crimes by keeping silent. Billionaire? On the list. Or knew and kept silent. If they don't like that assumption, they can use their political and monetary influence to get the list released; just like they used that power to bust unions and rig politics, they can use that power to bring the guilty to justice. / []
Such a loss ... brilliant woman. Now you can dance worry-free. / []
I’ve heard that most children get into this pd circles through their parents so this dad figure sounds suspicious already / []
Release the Epstein Files! / []
The irony of Australia pushing this while also banning Candace from their entire country, who also pushes this and keeps talking about it? / []
I am german and have to tell this, when it comes to the discussion, if she told the truth: at the age of 20, 1985, I spent half a year in London. My host family and others always were joking with me: Dont go out dressed up too "inviting" cause could happen that Randy Andy comes around and grabs you. / []
Please contact your local conspiracy theorist and issue an apology. Before this brave woman (somewhat) exposed (some of) them, those who were trying to expose this were labelled ‘lunatics.’ / []
What kind of parents allowed a 14 year old girl travel with strangers to be a “massage therapist?” / []
The occult mind control discussion is very important here  Victims struggle being targeted individuals and having both technological and dark occult practices against them  She probably couldn't say everything as she wanted to make the message digestable for the masses  Trudi Verstegen discusses the birthing of cloned people and the horrid rituals our leaders go to make them this evil through beyond evil upbringing  Those who manage to get out are rebels like her and Anneke Lucas and those who attack the active attackers not the helpless and volunerable / []
This is epic sad. I read a sorry of a program for inner city kids where they spent the summer in the homes of wealthy people. They were to obtain culture and exposure to the arts and opportunities. A mom sent her daughter. A child will trust that a parent knows best. In the 60 minute story, A father trusted his daughter with them. Similar this mom was excited. Her daughter would be exposed to places and things she could never afford. She would see life with a family that is whole instead of being home alone during summer in the projects. The story has a similar ending. She was raped by the dad. A lot of people are programmed to believe that rich people are morally superior and abuse only happens in poor inner city broken homes. It’s only because of the internet are we becoming exposed to how false this narrative is. / []
Watch this all. 1:06:30. Jesus. / []
Virginia’s life is a testament to how strong survivors are.  They don’t just want accountability they want to protect others from these monsters too. Trump is afraid of what will happen to him when we know what he has done. Release the Epstein files ASAP / []
RIP please share video / []
I think Tim Tebow is the only one with money trying to save children / []
The Royal Family is really a stick sick joke! 😢 / []
What a strong, individual she was.  Hopefully,  those who were responsible, are held accountable.  To take so much from a minor, is so unacceptable  No one should be able to walk away from this conduct... ever !!!  Rest In Peace and Love Virginia. / []
💔 / []
Her life is great she said. She worked so hard to bring these people down to end her own life after all that! I DON'T BELIEVE IT FOR A SECOND. / []
If you want to know how stressful this interview was. Look at BOTH of their necks. They both start getting red spots that get worse  the longer the interview goes on. / []
Life is about choices they all made their own choices and, along came the Consequences... I don't defend either side; both sides were using each other...There were no angels on either side, quite the opposite. She looked very happy in the photo next to the prince. She wasn't kidnapped or forced into anything. She knew why she was going to that mansion in New York. From what I see and hear, she could have left at any moment, but she stayed... Everyone is wrong in this mess of games of seduction, money and power. I think she should have reported it decades ago, but for her, now was more profitable, but also more dangerous...I don't defend either side; both sides were using each other...There were no angels on either side, quite the opposite. / []
Never forget. / []
I admire and applaud her. She is a Warrior. / []
They need to release the files without the markups and expose them all including Trump / []
Jeffrey will Rot in Hell  , but I feel like a lot of these girls put themselves there by their own actions and in those places that lead them to what happened to them. The parents are very responsible as well for these young girls. / []
Rest in peace, little angel / []
Who though. A lot of money has been made out of this book and her story but whats the point of her hints and not telling? / []
The abuse started at home .The father sold her to Jeffrey.That’s why the parents were not asking any questions and she never once asked for help 😢 / []
I wonder if Donald Trump has ever watched this? Not! Instead, he allowed Maxwell to move to a club med ‘prison.’ / []
I wonder if Charles has seen this interview / []
Still listening, what! Amazes me is that many of these man, excuse, for humans, have daughters. / []
"Chubby fingers..." 😂 / []
This is so unreal / []
There are thousands of young girls & boys who have been used just like this for year's.  The poor children are the rich people toys. And each & everyone of them should be exposed for crimes against these children/ teenagers. We can't protect our children  from them than who can ??? / []
Seven?!?  That is disgusting!!  This poor woman!  I cannot imagine.  Ghislaine needs to stay in prison, then go to hell for sure.  The reality is this is still going on all over the world!   Evil is so prevalent, it is just so horrible.  RIP Virginia / []
He told her that he was using her for blackmail purposes. For a period of time she knew that she was taking part in blackmail operations. Thus after that point, she knowingly participated in blackmailing powerful people. / []
Andy is JUST ONE among hundreds of sickos that need to be held accountable.  For the future and past victims. Enough is enough!!❗️❗️ / []
I pray she is at peace 🕊️ 🙏🏼 / []
She was a human trafficker is what everyone ignores,she admitted herself that she would go places all over the world and traffic young girls back to the island,she knew what she was doing,they paid her well for what she did,put her up in the fanciest hotels,gave her unlimited money.She needed all that to overlook that she was very much a big part of what went on / []
This is so sad!! To think about what these people did.  To them this girl was an object.  It breaks my heart to know she went to Epstein's with her father and Maxwell tells the father not to worry, your daughter is in good hands. / []
We believe you Virginia 🤲 / []
What an evil era are we living in!!! / []
Guislain should rotten in the worthiest jail for the rest of her life / []
Watching this interview and how well Virginia speaks, her “suicide” makes NO SENSE!!! JUSTICE FOR ALL THESE WOMEN!!!!! / []
Poor lady. RIP / []
RIP V. WE ALWAY REMEMBER U ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. GOD IS WITH U🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 / []
They killed epstein because there are bigger sharks... and they still swimming strong and still in charge...  focus now on the rest... / []
Ghislaine Maxwell is probably the worst of them all because and she is still denying it … / []
I just can't help concluding that by spending time with these people made her as manipulative as they were, as the years went by. It's unavoidable. I feel in this interview some of the manipulation comes through. After all they would have trained her on how to deal with powerful people. "Training days" "Training period". It was training in manipulation. 😢 / []
Run Away Girl gets abused then meets a prince. Isn't this Cinderella without the glass slippers ! / []
RELEASE THOSE DAM FILES / []
She was fricking let down by everyone so badly 😢 / []
Why did Virginia target Andrew and only Andrew ?  why does nobody ask this question?  What about all the other men to whom she refers as her abusers?   the billionaires, the professors, the politicians etc...who allegedly abused her?  Why didnt she go after them ?  Why only Andrew?  Also, one would guess that Virginia is not the only girl from Epstein's harem with whom Andrew would have had interactions.... why are other women not backing Virginia's claim ? / []
I have no words to express what I feel/ big wow and =love to that lady and the reporter / unreal/ but if lets say this lady would be my daughter or family I could not handle this nightmare. All those "powerful" people should be punished = justice. So sorry from my heart.. Kind of thanks for the upload and the truth will come out. / []
Her parent should have protected her at the age of 7 . Sadly she was messed up at the age of 7 years old . / ['It was her father']
Jeffrey told her that they were going to paying good money and that she was going to see the world. "They promised me all the wonderful things." "My dad was excited." / []
I understand when you trust someone and they hurt you like they did rest in peace I hope you get the justice you deserve / []
So this poor young lady(MHDSRIP) as already damaged goods by the time she was delivered into G. Maxwell's hands by her father. / []
A very complicated situation. Her father worked for trumpie and she herself was a trumpie supporter, believing that he would release the epstein files. / []
Are these even human? Preying on the most vulnerable instead of protecting them. How does a society descend into this depravity. If you do this to my sister, I will throw my life away to avenge her. / []
GODBLESS 60 MINS / []
She worked at Mara Lago. Trump is definitely in that file. / []
She broke my heart.  As a SA survivor myself I could relate to the feelings she describes here...shame, numbness, disgust, all of it.  I pray that one day ALL those files are released and every single person who was either directly involved or knew and looked away gets exactly what they deserve.  It's so sad that Virginia chose to end her life over it all.  But to survive that level of torture and come out the other side unscathed is very rare. / []
Release the list / []
Naomi Campbell, hm?!😏😒 / []
☝️😥 So very Sad, & the Republicans need to pursue the prosecution of all of Epsteins Conspirators. / []
@Naomi / []
Rest in peace Virginia. Release the Trump Epstein files! / []
There is no way she committed suicide! / []
I don't think people realize how easy it is to be manipulated into these types of abusive situations when you grew up on a faulty foundation,  let alone when powerful, rich people are involved. Rest in peace Virginia❤ / ['The foundations within the family with her dreadful Father created fault lines within Virginia but abusers look for young girls with that upbringing.', "You do think it's a necessary evil to get ahead. Especially if you have had early childhood sexual abuse. You lose who you are. Children don't like to tell because they are afraid they will get in trouble by their parents,no one will believe them, they also feel very dirty.", 'So, so true.', '❤', 'You\'re right in what you say. The interviewer keeps suggesting "why didn\'t you understand"... But I know what it\'s like. I left home at 14 and started working on farms. And you were basically tricked and exploited in a way that would be unthinkable today. My parents were academics, but when I tried to explain how I was doing, I was just silenced as if I shouldn\'t complain. And right then, at that age, and without references, you don\'t understand that there\'s another world out there, beyond the one you\'re in. You dream that the reality you\'re in wouldn\'t exist, but for some reason, you fight on as best you can. And that\'s how I understand it was for Virginia. At least I wasn\'t sexually exploited, except that there were men who tried, but through my hard work, I became strong and could protect myself from their attempts. Anyway, it seems that people lack the understanding that you, as a teenager, are still a child!']
As I watched the entire interview there were just two things searing in my mind: (1) That Trump facilitated the comfort of Maxwell's prison existence (2) That Trump is doing everything to block the release of the Epstein files Added to that, two questions are flooding my mind: (1) Why is Mike Smith doing everything imaginable to assist Trump in hiding the Epstein files? (2) Why is Pam Bondi & the rest of the 'generals' remaining compliant? / []
@28:30 thank you, exactly. Its the Pinocchio upside down donkey world. / []
Oh god Virginia I could cry. RIP 😢 / []
Why did she expose Andrew but not name the family friend who attacked her at 7 yrs old.She say she don't want to name that person / []
RIP poor darling. Demons truly walk amongst us / ["And we good people must stand up to them, don't be afraid, evil will lose in the long run", '\u200b@PaulFormentosNo one is good. All have sinned, including you and I, and come short of the glory of God.', "Demons don't make, human beings sin."]
Virginia G=Roberts should've got caounseling earlier BUT she went on hooked up with JEFFREY EPSTEIN find this a LADY Virginia not really SOUL SEARCHING herself which too me it should've been earlier.   Foolish Andrew & Jeffrey could've been used as bodies shieldding or covering VIRGINIA G=Robert which is a terrible road too take FOOLS / []
She was age of consent in uk and US and demonstrated a history of false allegation with Epstien lawyer..  Was the behaviour disgusting then change the age of consent and look beyond the ubiquitous victim claims in this segment. She lived with family so the real question was where her family was when she was being paid so well?? It is unfortunately you exploited  a very troubled adult.  May she rest in peace. Your investigative journalism shows softball questions and no investigations into her REAL history but it gives the sensational  trash hit you were looking for. / []
Let’s say it together: TRUMP / []
RIP dear one / []
Virginia was failed on so many levels. I pray that all who participated or enabled this madness are held accountable and exposed. May she rest in peace.😢 / []
All child sex offenders should be sentenced to life imprisonment or executed, as they cannot be reformed. / []
God bless her. Jesus is taking care of her precious soul now. Rest easy, sweet girl. I’m so sorry for you and your family. / []
Where are the video tapes then.just think of what could yet come out of the various info that is yet to be uncovered according to her. / []
How trump didnt know what epstein was about i find hard to believe. / []
Poor girl / []
I think she was murdered..I don’t believe she committed suicide..Virginia I think is the sixth person involved with the Epstein case that has mysteriously committing suicide ..it’s unquantifiable impossible for nearly seven people to commit suicide. / ['I agree especially in this high profile case. If anything it’s a professional hitman, and he specializes in strangulation. Also the bus that hit Virginia, I think that was an attempted hit. She lives in a remote area, there’s no traffic \n,', 'Clintonish😊']
All Virginia lost priceless inocence and childhood dreams of love, care and respect of the loving men... It is so painful to hear Virginia's story...  Story of cruelty, brutality of rich, wicked and vile men and women who harm childern just because they can and know that they will  go unpunished... / []
Rest in peace- Maxwell should be forced to watch this interview 24/7 / []
There is a distínct smell of the ' countryside ' about this !!🤔. / []
She said she should have caught on, but she was a child, in the hands of a master manipulator twice her age. That man had no business being in the vicinity of young girls, / []
I think its tragic she didnt make it to the end. I think her husbands physical abuse & the c ourt taking her children plus her bad car crash did her in as it was all too much to handle. Glad her story has come to light & hope the files will be released to give other victims some justice! RIP Virginia! / []
Orange was the penalty. The most violent one? That's what killed her, seeing one of her abusers every day on tv and speaking about it.🤔 / []
Kinayat mo net kitdi data / []
I’m really sorry she was sexually abused at such a young age.  Why didn’t she just walk away in her mid, late teens, when she knew what was happening? / []
Rest well V❤❤❤...they gonna get you justice ❤❤ / []
I am just really upset because this poor woman didn't get the help she needed. So sorry she could no longer live with what she had been through. RIP Virginia, you will never be forgotten ~ / []
There are death penalties because of a murder, one murder, well this is a murder. Because of child trafficking and  abusing there should be death sentences every single time. No excuses allowed nor given. "I didn't know she was fifteen" well that's just bullshit, you do know when you're speaking with a minor every single time. / []
this world needs to end. the world where powerful men hate and abuse women and children and treat them like objects. has to end. / []
Its like she had to beg to be relevant, seen, human. / []
My heartfelt sympathy goes out to all the people affected by Epstein’s ring of horrors. I am so sorry that happened to you / []
Trafficked through high-end resorts proved PROFITABLE FOR OWNERS same as flea-bag motels, they’re DESPICABLY complicit. / []
RIP Virginia! We need the Epstein file released and put those monsters in prison asap. This is evil & immoral to the core. / []
Ghislaine was a black widow observing, creeping up, and spinning a web for Virginia, a child, at Mar-Lag-o, then injecting her venom, delivering Virginia into the devouring mouth of an apex predator, who served her up as a party favor to the powerful, the brokers of  innocents. / []
This woman fought the good fight. May her soul rest in eternal peace. / []
I believe in her 100% / []
It is all too terrible  - but I have to ask why the only person she has named is Andrew - why???  Name the politicians, businessmen, etc etc who were also involved! / []
She recruited for them. At what point did she think maybe this is wrong. / []
She ends with Stand Up - yes speak out ...I will add, even if is a Priest abusing you !!!!!!! / []
Virginia suicide was so shocking and terribly sad. Why, oh why, did she need to take her life? / []
mes hommages madame 😢 / []
She’s so beautiful and tragic. Those before and after videos should be showcased on this issue before everyone forgets her.  People need to know how impactful early trauma is on young women and men who are molested in childhood.  The effects can be so sad. Only the family notices it.  It’s a soul murder. / []
Wow, what an excellent interview!  Award-winning, for sure. / []
It’s so clear that she didn’t kill herself. She’s so bright and seems grateful to be free. It really breaks my heart that she isn’t around to keep going and living her best life with her kids. I bet she is an amazing mother!!! / []
So sad 😢 / []
The Republicans hold all the responsibility now for this, Trump is a monster and all the rest of these elites / []
Poor Woman came to Australia to try and start a new life , and the media hounded her until she could take it no-more. / []
History will not be kind to MAGA. / []
I don't think she killed herself. / []
I don’t understand why or how but abusers can pick the one abused person out of a group of people that nobody else suspects. They zero in like sharks that detect blood in the water. This reinforces the feeling of worthlessness of the victims. After all you must be worthless look how  easily they find you.  Those who have never experienced the targeting reject with incredulity how many times the abused are forced to defend themselves or fall victim.  After all it’s not happened to them, there must be something wrong with the victims or in some way they surely  invite it. . Virginia is one such victim who almost accepts that that was her worth.  The scars run deep,  the pain is never ending and becomes too much to bear even after escape. Life full of difficulties becomes too big a mountain to climb again and again. Poor Virginia she just wanted the never ending pain whichever path she took to stop . May she rest in peace / []
Why did no one ask why is a child here! / []
RIP Virginia! This is so heartbreaking! 😢 / []
👍🙏Thanks / []
In her book it says that she was abused from a very early age. So I was surprised by the clsim she had a good childhood Childhood goes to...when? 11? 12? Older? / ['She was 7yo. So, her nice and normal childhood was from birth until 7yo.']
AMEN - AWOMEN- ACHILD !!!!!! / []
Clearly.. some people are above the law. / ["But nobody is above the Lord. Every single person will be judged by God. So, even when we don't see justice on earth, there will be an incoruptable Judge after our last breath. Thank God for that!"]
It cuts my heart, am crying and feeling her story so deep !!! How anybody can ignore that !!!!!  Dear Americans and others in this world, you need to wake up !!!!!!  You need to learn how to protect THE INNOCENT in any part, sphere in our life !!! What a abuse !!!! And only one person in jail and the other one death !!! What about all the others . Those Predators !!! They live in evil sexual energy and their poison abuse too many !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wake up !!!! / []
Horrible monsters! Release the Epstein files! / []
In her book she writes that her dad sexually abused her first. Then the family friend. / []
My heart breaks every time I see the sadness in her eyes, hear the pain in her voice. 💔😪 When I see her father, I get so angry. That he even dares to give interviews. What would have become of your daughter if you had been the father every daughter deserves? I despise you as I despise everyone who did this to Virginia.   Yes, they say they will be punished when they stand before their creator. For many, that may be enough, but not for me. Because how many children and young people are going through hell every minute? Because these inhuman beings, these criminals, are walking around free and are not being held accountable. Why? Because they hold high positions around the world? Because then the world would be turned upside down? So what? How much worse can it get in this world? It can only get better.  So everyone protects everyone else and the horror just goes on.  I should forgive them, then God will forgive them too? I don't know how I can forgive that. I am a victim of my childhood and youth. What would have become of me if I had had a happy childhood? It's pointless to ask, because I'll never know. Children's souls are so easy to break.  I had hoped so much that Virginia had found the happiness with her husband that she so deserved. Learning what happened in her marriage makes me so incredibly sad.  I hope Virginia's children will one day realize what kind of woman their mother was.🙏 A woman who had the courage and refused to be silenced. Who was strong for herself and others. Who gave us victims a voice. Virginia, I hope so much that your soul and your heart can finally heal now. I don't have the reach of your voice, but I will not be silenced, and when I see injustice, I will not stand idly by. You are a great role model for me.❤️🫂❤️🙏🕯🕊 / []
Something was wrong here, since she was 13 she said that she stayed because she wanted the massage  certificate and turned 19 waiting to get that certificate that you can easily get in 6 months in any place around USA. Many young girls stayed because of the easy money and the addiction of drugs. Taking advantage of these girls need to be in jail. / []
Thank you 60 minutes Australia for the in-depth interview... and also to Ms. Virginia Guiffre and those similarly situated victims for  having the courage to share their story.  As an aside, mark my words, 2 people Prez Grandpa Turd would pardon before leaving office would be Ghislaine Maxwell and himself.😮 / []
What an amazingly courageous strong beautiful woman she was. RIP Virginia / []
why hasnt anyone ( journalist or investigator) never got a hold of any of the other girls and get some names , why didnt she release names either ,even to have left names with a family friend or lawyer should anything happen to her ?? / []
Was  Virginia in touch with her parents during this time?  So much for “A normal American Family” her brother describes them as. / ['I was wondering too. But I think the way she was controlled by J. and G. it might either have been coordinated or not at all. 🤷\u200d♀️']
As a survivor  of sexual assault   Virginia  Giuffre story resonates. Even when you’re able to escape  It is a life time of recovery.  It affects every aspect of your life.   Virginia is an incredible brave person.  Her bravery to speak out against the horrific crimes committed against her. Has help many others who could never find the strength to face their abusers.  Rest in Peace Virginia.  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💕 / ['I feel you.❤🫂❤️']
She was betrayed by her parents as well..very sad / []
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO START MAKING ARRESTS   ? / ['I wish I have the answer. 💔']
doesn't seem very suicidal / []
14:30 "I couldn't catch a thought." How perfectly that describes the mind placed in such an extreme situation. / ['True.']
The thing about being an early childhood victim is that it almost brands the victims to all the predators. Like a neon sign on there forehead that says victim. / ["That's right. It's as if some men have a sensor for it. It took me years to realize that."]
I pray these monsters DO NOT GET AWAY WITH ANY OF THESE CRIMES  WE DEMAND THE VIDEOS TO BE RELEASED / []
She was such a lovely person it seemed and so brave I wish she could still be here to see some progress still not enough but I think we are very close to getting it we need Justice for Virginia / []
Ong.  I pray that you’re in peace and love now. / []
THANK YOU...!!! / []
RELEASE THE EPSTEIN VIDEOS / []
❤ You were/are not responsible for the twisted actions of other people.  It only takes being abused once for the freeze response to be activated.  That freeze response is within us our entire lives. Virginia is amazing for being able to speak of any of the horrors that she was forced to endure.  I understand why she felt that she needed to end her life, if that is indeed what happened.  But we must ALWAYS REMEMBER that she had the courage to speak up about incredibly influencial people.  She put herself in an incredibly vulnerable position to ensure that others might not be forced to live the hell that she had forced upon her. My love and respect to Virginia and all the people she loved.  To her children, you mother loved you so very much.  ❤ / []
Oh the poor thing. My heart breaks for her when she said “I just felt I can’t catch a break”.  She broke and resigned to this was her life. 😢 / []
Good you did not have to go through IVF without you knowing about it...!!! / []
Your not going to commit suicide when you've just been given 12 million pounds / ['And you think all that money will heal your soul and take away the pain?']
Completely irresponsible sensationalist reporting. "Sex trafficking empire" LOL good grief Virginia is a serial fabricator and the mainstream media still has not learned their lesson. / []
It hurt me in my gut to see this young lady and ear the horror that she have been trought all her life , its heartbroken , with such pain it was just a matter of time , no body is humanly capable to bear so much sorrow, i hope that wherever she is , she will find some peace . May God have mercy of her poor soul😢 / []
What a tragic shame that she finally was able to live in a little bit of peace and had received enough money to live her life without struggling then after that lifelong fight she picked the wrong man to protect her and he abused her terribly.  Rest in peace Virginia, your pain is gone. / []
Yes the black book.📖 is real -Trump / []
They killed her. She never once mentioned Trump at the island. Pay attention folks. All the politicians you love are the evil ones. The devil is a master manipulator / ['Clinton might be on that list.']
Why did she only name Prince Andrew ? / ['Listen and you know she said the names.']
She didn’t know how much her voice , her words,and story , so eloquently described, would be completely understood by all . Particularly after this interview / []
I wish she was still here. She had so much value as a person. Shame on trump / []
This was the best interview I’ve ever seen.  WOW.  People wake up! / []
Does anyone else wonder if she was murdered? / []
It is not one or few persons responsible for these kind of criminality... It is the whole system of GOVERNING, LAW& ORDER SYSTEMS, JUDICIARY, CIA LIKE COVERT AGENCIES  and RELIGIOUS - POLITICS  ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT...!!!  CRIMINALS COULD USE LAW AND RELIGION, PSYCHOLOGY AND PARA- PSYCHOLOGY  TO  INFLICT GUILT, & SUFFERING... AS  PUNISHMENT  AND TARNISH THE REPUTATION & DIGNITY OF THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES... USING RELIGION... AND ITS LEADERS AND LAITIES...!!!  IT IS ONE OF  THE MODERN DAY SLAVERYS ...!!!  TODAY MODERN TECHIES ARE HELPING THEM TO CONTROL THESE  VICTIMS OF THE CRIMINALS...!!! / []
I hope Virginia you have your peace! We believe you. Rest in Peace, we will remember you. / []
Something I saw no one say is that Virginia girl said she was predatorized by Jeffrey and some woman at Mara logo… Donald trumps freaking house guys?? Hello? Connect the dots maybe Donald Trump does the same type of shit…. Why was Epstein chillin at Donald’s?heres the definition of what Mara logo is…. Is probably a sex trafficking house cause I don’t buy this definition…. Donald Trump Lucifer just know that:…   What is the Mar-a-Lago deal with Trump? “The Mar-a-Lago Accord, introduced during Trump's second term, reflects a new strategy: that the United States can, through assertive, risky economic policy, retain reserve currency status while reindustrializing and rebalancing global trade on American terms”  That’s what internet says like wtf does that even mean people? Donald Trump is doing the same shit what do you think his new ballroom is for? New victims!!! / []
A perpetrator can identify a victim or someone that is vulnerable . / []
This should go viral...so that the pesos can no longer hide. / []
That is what happens even today...using AI NEURO- LINK TECHNOLOGY... EVEN IN THE TOILET...!!! / []
The rich and powerful need to be subjected to the same laws as everyone else.  They should not be able to be above the law or be able to buy their way out of it.  Pedophiles are put in special prisons and they cannot live near schools when they get out and neighborhoods are notified if they live there. / []
EVEN POPE WILL NOT DO IT... THEN HOW COULD WE EXPECT THESE EVIL CRIMINALS TO DO THAT...!!!??? / []
As a survivor I hear her discussing my whole life. I've never had a wholesome relationship. I felt awkward with 'normal' people / []
She is still vulnerable—thinking that JE is actually 6 feet under / []
G. Maxwell needs to stay in jail!!! / ['Rot!']
Trump release the files. / []
This is so sad.  Epstein rot in HELL. / []
OMG / []
Working as a prostitute and getting paid thousands is not sex trafficking.  Doesn't want to name person so who trafficked her before age of consent.  What a bullshit interview / []
What did she mean by "they were all put back together "? / []
THEY KILLED HER. THE ROYAL FAMILY, AND EPSTEIN PPL KILLED HER. / []
Her Father got her the job at Mar-a- logo... Her father drove her to Epstein's house... Things that make you go, Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm / []
the truth will come out.      It is not easy to be beautiful in this sad and corrupt 🌍. / []
Monster Maxwell is now serving her sentence in a low security prison. Why? RELEASE THE FILES!!! / ["Why?  It's so obvious.  Trump's crony went in and talked with her privately for hours, a deal was made because Maxwell has evidence on Trump, and she got moved to a cushier place.  It's not rocket science."]
Virginia did not end her own life. No way in hell that’s what happened. / []
RIP Virginia… 😢🙏 / []
what was date of this interview? / ['2019']
All the enablers and the people who looked the other way (looking at you Naomi)... / ["Are responsible for Virginia's death, and should be charged as such."]
She met up when they called. / []
Well put!! 🎉 / []
When she said their were tv cameras everywhere sounds like Puff, recording all the trafficking on video. / []
Isn’t Mara logo Donald trumps Place??? / []
So who are all these politicians, billionaires, celebrities, etc, why was Andrew singled out, or is it just him 😮 / []
How completely irresponsible her parents were to let her even go for a 'job interview' as a 'travelling massage therapist' for a complete stranger at 14yo?  In my view her parents are totally culpable. / ['Culpable or else also incredibly naive.', 'They probably got paid!', 'Complicit. They sold her.', 'Read her book, it’s darker than that.', '@olgashmtv1875no quit making $hit up!']
FAKEST SHIT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂FAKE FAKE BULLSHIT ACTING 🎭 FAKE😂😂😂 I love 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 it!!!!! / []
Virginia was NOT suicidal y'all! She stated so multiple times! I hope she's haunting every single one of them! Karma, where you at girl????!!! 💔 / []
Idk man she was 16.. at what age do you take accountability for your own actions.  I knew at 13-14 that sex with older men wasn’t normal for society. She was coerced no doubt. But still… there’s something that doesn’t set well with me.   We are not naive as people claim us to be. On the school bus these kids learn a lot of things and that’s just daily life for all kids / []
Why didnt her Dad report them or her Mother / ['you haven’t read the book, huh?  They weren’t any better']
I prayed for God to heal you and other women who suffered this abuse & God to punish all of those guilty.  As a mother, I am heartbroken that this goes on. Thank you for your courage to share. I am happy to know that you are living a beautiful life free of slavery. / []
Maxwell was like the aunts in handmaid's tale. / []
She didn't tell her parents because they were not safe for her. She was still a child without words to articulate what was happening to her. This is why they're so vulnerable and the predators rely on it. / []
Evil people sink to the depths of depravity, so nothing is surprising what they resort to.  Know leopards never change their marks!  These people are psychopaths and deny truth.  They will pay for their sins in the eternities not on this earth! / []
The FBI took all of the footage he filmed of lots of Sexual abusers from the World's Rich and they destroyed ALL THE FOOTAGE. They say there is no evidence of this but people who were there at the time and the security say different. The FBI are as corrupt as any other US police force. / []
This is just one of the most devastating stories of sex abuse my niece was 8nyears old when we found out she was sexually abused by her step father and of course it would be her fault if she told and the family would be destroyed the story goes on and so years later of drug abuse no self worth other things I choose not to say is a shams they are of all walks but Jesus knows he sees and knows it all .She suffers no more bless her Lord . / []
We all know powerful Israeli supporters have their fingerprints on this clandestine operation. / []
I have a 10 yo daughter and I am WATCHING EVERYTHING all the time. I always ask her what is happening. / []
I can so understand what Virginia is describing, especially when she talks about the numbness.  In my mind I would fly away to the treetops of the giant eucalypts that surrounded our property  When I think back now it seems my theory was if I can’t keep my body safe from them at least they will never get my mind.  I could sit up there and watch my body below and only return when they had gone. / []
51:58 Oh no, poor girl.  The son of the Queen, a prince who at birth was the second to the throne of Great Britain hugging her. How terrible, hahaha.... and I supposed to sorry her?  Yeah, sure, lol... / []
Has her death been investigated? / []
Absolutely despicable human beings who just treat innocent young girls n dehumanise them just for their perverted sexual gratification. Who brings these pervets into the world n what were their upbringings like? Can you imagine if Mafia had been around n this twisted perverted sick dog pulled a stunt like this to one of their innocent teenage girl. Mafia would have tortured n made sure he died a horrific n violent death. Mafia condones "twistered perverts". My heart aches for this innocent girl they truly destroyed. RIP VIRGINIA THEY CANNOT HURT YOU ANY MORE YOU ARE FINALLY AT PEACE. I CRIED FOR THE PAIN SHE ENDURED. / []
Her FATHER got her a job at Maralargoo. I have no words. / []
Naomi needs to be questioned / ['Agree.']
Enough! RIP, and stop destroying lives / []
Poor child … 🥲 / []
Well well well… what we have here? 22:00 mark… Mar-a-Lago… well welll well… interesting / []
For any minutes I can't believe she make, suicide!  she leave alone farmland In Australia.Isolated   ,no family ...after she die her family coming close.too late... / []
She is so incredibly brave RIP.  Ghislaine is not a human, she is an animal who preys on innocent girls. That man got off easy he deserved so much more pain and suffering. / []
There is alot more... remember Jon Luke Brunel also died in custody in France .. he was a terrible perp assossiate x married top model Kursty Turlington who eventually divorced him. How come all these people were complicit..all these models x their friends must have known. Why didn't she, as his wife know? / []
By the time any files related to Epstein are made official they would have been doctored to protect the powerful men in them. / []
Virginia talked about how Trump believed her and supported her… fast fwd we are being told there is nothing there and why are we still talking about Jeffery? I don’t want to talk about him I want to find these power pedophiles he was supplying children to and shattering their worlds. God will get the ultimate revenge on the ones who do evil to children. But on earth I want names confirmed and lively hoods taken away you shouldn’t be living the high life still,  after being involved in such disgusting acts. No one should get rewarded for doing evil. Like a child you punish for bad behavior & reward for good… I am trying to stay in my Christian mindset which is hard bc I love children and it truly hurts me deeply that ppl can abuse children in any shape or form … truly I know Jeffery was only one handler there are so many more and many of children being trafficked or killed. Makes me so sad. / []
She died by suicide at age 41 just this year. Although the cause is suspicious. / []
Nawit broke mt heart when she said she expected ir from men  but not women ( meaning ghislaine.) / []
She wasn't just vulnerable because she was young, but because she was raised that way, beaten by her mom and sexually abused by her dad. I really feel for her. I hope her kids are o.k. 🙏💙🌎💚🙏💜 / []
Clearly this is what happens when parents don’t guide and watch over their children!!!!!!!  VG was abused so many times from the age of seven that she never knew she could say NO!!!  She was so destroyed she couldn’t fight for her right to a protected life!!!  RIP VG / []
There is NO WAY that this poor woman "committed suicide." She was CLEARLY MURDERED to shut her up! Why is no one doing anything about it?! It's like she's been victimized AGAIN-- even in death!! / []
Former Prince Andrew needs to come clean / []
United States is number one expect trafficking throughout the world / []
This interview was something in her suicide… it was an execution ….rest in peace…Epstein and Ghislane are monsters… / ['😢😢😢😢']
She’s far too courageous to kill herself. She wrote in her book that she would be killed. If something happened to her. She would not take her life and leave her babies that meant the life to her. / []
I bet all trumps payoffs were from those who were involved ! He's taking the baton from Jeffrey / []
She breaks my heart, although her courage and sincerity are so beautiful.  No one should have to endure that much pain and degradation, but at long last she is completely free. / []
Dissociation would have helped hide away the pain but not everyone has the ability to dissociate. To remember all the abuse more than just in an intellectual way might have been quite destructive over time. She made a great contribution, however, that cannot be discounted. / []
Any questions NOW on why they won't release the files??? / []
Who are the people that worked in here house they should be turned in. They know what’s going on for there every day. / []
Wasn't Naomi a model at 14 ? So she used to be in those parties from a young age right ? / []
Virginia was taken out, folks. She tweeted about what eventually happened to her and said NOT to believe it if it ever happened to her. / []
Case right now in Ohio, where a doctor was allegedly keep doing sexual acts to his baby that he was not even married to the mother. She was a single parent, the mothers 10 to 15 years in prison for trying to rescue her child from being molested by this doctor. / []
I am incredibly sad for her. She had such a sad life. I wish she hadn’t taken her life, but depression is a powerful thing that people who are not depressed can never understand. may she finally have peace. And her family she left behind, find peace in knowing she is no longer in pain. 💜 / []
Nightmare. 😫 / []
I understand you my abuse started at 7 ended at 14 you went through so much more than me and I really understood  when you said you would tell the child to run sweet girl I would hug 🫂 you right this moment if you were here I would just hold you / []
Just like jeffie boy Virginia didn’t end herself. Rip so many childhoods stolen from these sick individuals / []
This is makes me mad about the father start this is own her book and now a lot people involve why she's don't wash dishes she didn't have education wat to spect when it's not education clean floor do cleaning like the rest of the people that don't have education. 😮 / []
Remind me of Rosemary‘s baby, where all these evil people in different occupations are involved in this evil / []
It was normal to us. Whatever evil takes place in our young life, we have no experience.  And remember these people are like running in a wolf pack. / []
"IT'S CORRUPT. IT'S CORRUPT TO THE CORE"  Virginia Guiffre / []
This is a revelation from the grave by this poor woman Virginia Giuffre about the depth of evil and corruption intertwined between billionaires,  British monarchy, professors, politicians. She is 100 % believable and has brought down the final curtains on the House of Windsor. It begs the question why the late Queen did not act and let this go on. Now it is too late. King Charles actions are too little to save the Palace now from the common British people. The biggest casualty will be the end of British Monarchy now. Beginning of the end brought by a poor dead white American woman from the grave. This is called Karma catching up for all the misdeeds. / []
To stand up and talk about sexual abuse trauma that has happened to you on a huge public scale and esp with powerful people trying to quiet you and esp when abuse is in your private life - she was incredibly strong ❤ / ['Imagine trying the words, but when you’re being a set up to get something crazy when she’s young and vulnerable without the tools']
she was 17.  she had choices.  sick of hearing about this. / []
Her parents should be arrested / []
Such a shame her trauma was just too much for such long time. Final straw was her separation from her family. Understanding her past affected ever aspect of her relationships if you failing apart u can lash out your closet loved ones. / []
And we need to teach kids that counselors, teachers, psychologists etc are mandated reporters so if the child tells a mandated reporter about abuse and nothing is done, the child knows they need to find help. / []
It’s easy to sell something you believe in or are okay with. It’s when you don’t believe in it that it’s hard to sell “it”. / []
It’s not be understood. It’s crazy. You can’t understand craziness / []
Rest in peace Virginia ❤🙏❤🙏🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦 / []
Rest in peace Virginia ❤🙏❤🙏🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦 / []
This poor woman lived through hell her entire life. All the perpetrators need to be brought to justice. She was a very brave soul. RIP Virginia, we will fight for you. ❤  Release the EPSTEIN FILES!!!! / []
💐 / []
She tried telling her family when her father was abusing her. The family is unhealthy and they want to keep the unhealthy family the same and so they go against the black sheep who tries to go against the crazy family and that’s what they did to her she got beaten up for trying to reach out to her family to protect her when she was being molested by her father Then 15% chance of continuing abuse after you were molested by her father and then her father’s friend and then her father sold her off to Epstein / []
Why do the American people and President Trump protect Ghislane  Maxwell and associates in November 2025? / []
6:55 She was a masseuse but she did not know what is the job of the masseuse.  Yeah, sure. / []
I am sure everyone involved was enslaved either as innocents, through black mail, or payoff. / []
That poor girl ! !   So many girls are in  and have been in this horrible situation    Boys too.  Much more needs to be done about this ! / []
This interviewer’s comments are to get Virginia to say what’s already obvious. / []
I pray she's at peace this breaks my heart she i do believe still was murdered accident????????? They needed her gone. Sending prayers to her children. Trump released these files. Trump you promised us, Trump are you part of Epsteins list?????????????? Her husband of 20yrs abused her too. She hasn't had a break her own father sexual abused her. I feel sick. / []
Very good you did the right thing! RIP Angel soul! / []
Because people 25 and under are vulnerable, they’re still young she was she was only 16 / []
Why don’t they offer tissues and water when someone starts to cry on their show? / []
I can understand Virginia when she followed instructions, but I still see her at that point leaving and going back to Mar a Lago. / []
Poor VIRGINIA abuse can paralyze  a yong child....i understand her completely. Rest in heaven little precious girl❤❤❤ / []
Six years and we don’t have the Epstein file and these pedophiles are not in prison / []
After watching this very well conducted interview, I am left with this one huge flashing question: why on earth would this young woman take her own life? She is intelligent, well-spoken, and speaks from the heart. And she is on a mission; people on a mission don't kill themselves. I hope she has peace, and that others pick up the torch and run with it. / []
Where were her PARENTS at this point??? / []
I admire the strength Virginia displayed in this interview. She served the entire world by speaking so boldly. Did she actually die by suicide? I can imagine her short life was plenty enough for anyone. / []
RIP / []
Interviewer verges on victim blaming at times, the look on her face is like a vampire feeding off Virginia's pain. Sickening. Why did she stay? Virginia had been sexualised and traumatised from an early age and like she said she thought this was how life is. / ['Media grifters like this 60 Minutes woman and Emily Maitlis used Virginia as a victim object in their fear porn. Fear porn is where the money is made. Emily has dined out on her interview  with Andrew ever since and 60 Minutes keeps reposting this interview, last one was just a week ago. Virginia needed to release the trauma she held in her mind and body but these bloodsuckers encouraged her to replay it again and again for their need for a story.']
Wow. I just realized what happened to her. I am so sorry. / []
If this interview is from 2019, why are you uploading it again? / []
I doubt a regular car crash got her.  🙄 / []
Well…….EXPOSE them already!!!! / []
13? / []
Thank you for keeping her name alive! One day her voice will get the justice it deserves 🙏 / []
😢😢😢did she say 12 yr old 😮💔💔 that's breaks my heart that's so sick 🤢🤢 how did Trump not know there's no way he had to of know / []
Thank you- your words express how I feel and it is rare to hear.  Keep finding your own joy. / []
And that wonderful husband ended hurting her too? wonder if he got anything too? Im so sorry. Rest in peace. / []
This young lady did not have a chance. Molested at seven and not protected. I bought her book, but can’t read it yet. I applaud her courage and fight. It hit hard when she expected some current traction from the Trump administration to expose the non redacted Epstein files. We know this is a dead issue- for now. / []
Why did her dad let her work at a spa as a child?   She had no decent adults in her life. / []
Ghislaine in my opinion as a woman doing this to a child is even more heinous than Epstein. This poor woman when she talked about being punished- now we know who she means about. May her soul rest in peace. May she finally be at peace ❤ / []
This poor baby❣️💔 / []
You will be in our hearts forever, Virginia. Sending love to all survivors. / []
What were her mom and dad doing to protect her?  They must have known she was abused as a very young child. / []
I'm sorry she's gone - my heart goes out to Virginia's loved ones. / []
Jewish people are so innocent. And I really, really mean that. Really. / []
As a survivor of child sex abuse and violence, and the aftermath, I do believe every word and feeling that Virginia expresses.  So sorry for what she suffered!  I admire her deeply, her inner and outer beauty, her sensitivity and intelligence!  Virginia’s dedication to survivors, to spare them— is exemplary and very powerful!  It’s also understandable and tragic that her vulnerability set her up for others to take advantage, probably her past husband, included.  I’m so very sorry this life took her at such a young age!  Lots of love to you now, in the spirit world, dear precious, Virginia!  ❤❤❤ / []
Leaders are more responsible than everybody else. I hope and pray for exposure and accountability now!! 😡😡😡 / []
Eloquent and brave / []
Her dad sounds clueless. / []
We generally teach children about dangers they may encounter…fire, for example. We talk about it in school. Police talk to school children about a variety of things to help them stay safe. We need to normalize teaching children about bodily autonomy and the tactics some adults use to lure children to them. / []
That interviewer should be fired. She’s clearly completely unsympathetic and very judgey!!  What a diabolical interview!!!  It’s very clear that she has no respect for Virginia. She’s diabolical. / ['\u200b@bruceeide5644\nMedia Industry has many suspect people working for them.', "The interviewer asked questions that many in the public are curious about, in order to give Virginia the opportunity to explain. She wasn't judging her. She was allowing her to reach those who did judge her. Very well done."]
Keep up the pressure. Our government is hiding too much stuff. / ['They would hide it, given so many of them are part of the horror.']
Virginia, I really hope now that you are at peace. I have always believed this beautiful soul and if we all keep speaking up she and many more like her will get justice. I am so sorry for what happened to you Virginia. / []
This needs to be seen by everyone.     But I will admit it is terribly triggering for a number of reasons. / []
Just absolutely f-ing heartbreaking! / []
The truth will come out!! We know trump involved too / []
In recent weeks this has now blown up and rightly so! Virginia and all of those vulnerable young girls need justice and those who are guilty need to be imprisoned and one of them should be Andrew Mountbatten Windsor! Maxwell can stay in prison for good! / ['Not young girls, young women and a few legal aged teens. All knew what they were signing up for and Giuffre was their recruiter.']
Ghislane Maxwell was a major contributor  facilitating the recruitment of both clients and victims which enabled Epstein to operate a scheme that appeared to provide business advice while in reality involving the sex trafficking of minors and the movements of funds in the millions. Ghislane needs prison for life! / ['😂😂😂😂']
Virginia was really a beautiful soul, I am sad she was failed, rest in peace sweet girl...I still don't believe she killed herself, way too many BILLIONAIRES out there, she was done in! / []
Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew etc / []
As a psychiatric nurse who has studied trauma and worked with young people who have been abused, I have to speak out. Talking about the trauma/abuse - over and over, retraumatizes  the victim. I fear that Virginia’s mental health deteriorated because she relived the abuse and reaffirmed her brokenness over and over. This interview is triggering for her and other victims of sexual abuse. RIP Virginia 🙏❤ / []
This poor girl.  The way she explains it is so obviously real.  I can't believe after all this time we live in a world where this is still allowed to happen.  The most powerful people are covering up for it.  Protecting the wrong people 😡 / []
I am not convinced she committed suicide! / []
What kind of father leaves their daughter at a stranger’s house by herself? / ['Both.', 'Where the heck was her mother? And why didn‘t she see what her own husband did to her wonderful daughter?\nAs a mother myself of a beautiful daughter my heart is breaking. Just imagining something like this could happen to her makes me sick. Luckily we don‘t live in the US.', 'The father worked at Mar Largo, he must have known what was going on \u200b@Sapere_aude-u3q', '@HappyOtter1 Why? Even this question is relevant. Don’t lecture others.']
she willingly attended these events she wasnt a child she has been doing this to other men long before andrew / ['"Willingly" 7 years old attended?']
This is so heartbreaking, and l am so sad that this beautiful young lady took her own life. You can see in the photos how young she was at those adult parties. It's sickening. RIP, sweetheart Virginia. I'm from the adult entertainment industry from 18 years old and this young lady was exploited and taken advantage of. Yes, she got paid - though that kind of situation, this young girl, underage, was brainwashed, had fear put into her and more....... Release all of the files. Justice will speak the truth. 💛💛💛💛💛💛 / ['Virginia was more likely murdered than a suicide.']
You should have seen what the UK corruption is, united korruption with k. They expiriment on human beings, violating human rights laws non stop specifically the most corrupt of all Labour Party. Its sickening what they do and how they do it. Truly sickening / ["It's worldwide.  The global crime cartel."]
You can feel her sadness and despair. Virginia was brave and tenacious. This is difficult to watch but very necessary to see. Those files should be released but rest assured, our Heavenly Father has those files and the perpetrators will one day answer to an authority they can’t fool or avoid. / []
How about she dishes the dirt on all the other men.   Why only name Andrew / []
They killed her. She didn’t commit suicide / []
She was very brave and went farther with her accusations than most. My heart breaks that the stress of it all finally got to her and she took her own life.  Rest in peace dear one. You were a champion and so brave!!! I pray other dirtbags will be brought to justice as your book gets out. / []
She was clearly a victim of 2 very big abusive manipulative NARCISISSITS. Total gaslighting how they maniplated her to think they were going to help her. They prayed on her  vulnerabilities. / []
This kind of stuff will be happening until the end of time. / ['Or until the end of the Luciferian crime cartel.']
Why do.  If she was disgusted / []
Malignant narcissism  demons predators that hurt her. Justice for all victims of predators. If her Dad and Brothers got Justice would be legit  should be rewarded as Heroes. Sorry sweetheart . 😭💔 / []
If she was going to name Andrew she should have put a name to the others. Not much doubt in my mind that Andrew is guilty but why just him? / []
She NEVER had a break... From being raped over and over by either her father then sex traffic twice and to find love with a wife beater for a husband. 🌹May you rest in peace🌹 No more suffering ... 🤲🕊 / []
After all that. Bleeding and hospital admission. Why did she go back  knowing what she had to do / []
This hurts my heart so bad! Poor poor lady! RIP brave Virginia ❤ / []
Old news and I only hope all perpetrators have got the message that you at some point will be made accountable , if not today then tomorrow / []
Monstrous behavior of Epstein and Ghelian Maxwell.   She told them of cruel abuse and they sent her back for more.  Evil people. / []
Where was the mother? ?!! Also this interviewer was weird! / []
Wow she literally never caught a break in life! Like wtf! This breaks my heart!!!💔💔 / []
Free USA from AIPAC hijack !!! Free American leaders from Zionist blackmail and bribes / []
Virginia’s explanation rings true in every way.   From surviving sexual abuse, numbness, being confused by adult’s intentions…it all fits.   Our society needs to understand how sexual predators work and victim’s are easily spotted by them and brought into their web.  Survivor’s understand how victims shut down emotionally, split off from themselves to make abuse by sexual predators normal.   Virginia memory is believed! / []
This is the problem with great wealth---once you have all the mansions and yachts and private jets that money can buy, what's left? Power. The power to subjugate people. The power to control politics and the economy. So much for democracy. No one should have that kind of power. / []
Sex sells 🙄🙄 / []
Use to be friends would trap friends and get cash now it’s older women ect 👿 / []
A sick Evil Society 😈 that’s been around since the early 70s when they first showed themselves to the daylight to the innocent they stalk the weak and go in for the kill and that would be the woman / []
Virgins go to the best of the best for a lot of gold and then they just get past around / []
Makes you feel like your a dirty bad girl at that age and younger and older you suffer that until you get help. These men don’t care neither do the Physco women involved this poor baby 😢 / []
She seems like such a gentle soul ❤ / []
How did she die. / []
I feel for her so much....I wish I could hug her....may she rest in peace forever / []
Do you think she really committed suicide? I don’t. / ['Yes I do. Don’t forget there was a restraining order against her. You can weather many storms in life and fight however being kept away from your children, you lose the will and fight', 'I think it was made to look like a suicide.']
Media? My God, anyone waiting for the Media to undercover anything is a complete JOKE / []
RIP dear VIRGINIA. So sorry that these horrible people abused you. Release the files name the abusers. / []
Horses are incredibly healing animals and it’s said that when you look into the eyes of a horse, they can see your soul. I was the victim of severe emotional neglect and bullying by people who were from 10-15 years older than me. If it were not for the horses in my life, I would not be alive today! / []
WHERE WAS HER MOTHER??? / []
😢R I P   you were taken from your children,  you beautiful soul,  and  thank you and all the other victims for exposing evil rich preditors. / []
They killed her, her voice was getting louder, silenced her before she started exposing others, And why has it taken the palace so long to remove Andrews title. The Royals are just as bad. / ['This seems the likely scenario to me.']
Her dad started the abuse, then she just ran. Things got worse & Epstein/Maxwell were the devils at the END,🥲 / []
The interviewer keeps smiling! It is sickening. What is the smile about? / ['Sympathy.']
Her husband was an abuser too. A mean human being who almost beat her to death / []
I'm currently  listening to her book on Audio and it's so heatbreaking the life she had since she was just a small child. RIP Virginia. / []
Aahw! This interview should be shown in secondary schools.  Virginia was manipulated like a puppet.The abuse she suffered during her childhood made her accept all these horrors. This is what abuse in childhood does… Virginia was on autopilot. She couldn't tell her mother because her mother didn't protect her then from her father. She was her fathers accomplice. And because of the abuse she suffered during her childhood she never learned to distinguish between good and bad people. The interviewer asks: Why go back?  A broken soul does.... Naomi Kamble's look on the photo, she seemed wondering about this very young girl… Why didn't she do anything?   Epstein shaking hands with the Pope !@#$%??! / []
WHERE HER MOTHER??? / []
Such a powerful woman! Such a brave soul! Time for real justice! / []
Drop Ghislane in the middle of a counry field or in a holler. Only let the women know. She won't leave. / []
Lord rest her soul. No one should have to endure those atrocities. / []
All your scars are no longer  yours. They are now in  the Hands of the One Who holds you now!! RIP  our beautiful brave  Angel the God who holds you now will make those who  hurt you pay for all the wrong they committed against you. I wish with all my heart that you had not suffered the way you did. My heart is so broken for you  💔💔😢😢. But I know the God I know will make them all pay!! I don't know what I would have done if anyone would have hurt my daughter, granddaughter, or great granddaughter the way they hurt you. No one can hurt you now, sweet angel.😢 / []
Virginia is gone, never forgotten. This is a teaching. Thank you, dear soul.  I hope that wherever you are, it’s beautiful, loving, peaceful and safe. / []
I believe her 1000% may she rest in peace ❤ / []
Where is Naomi Campbell in this discussion? / []
She cd have said no, stopped being paid in that ‘job’; her family cd have helped her to leave. / []
This poor woman 😢. So sad & strong. Losing her kids I’m sure did her in!!! / []
It’s astonishing to me that this was clearly a significant operation. And yet NOBODY mentions anything higher than events and personalities ‘on the ground’ so to speak. The people who need to be held to account go beyond the perpetrators and enablers. Those running the whole thing should be liable too. We know what this is, so why is it never mentioned?  Also, there are a few places in this interview where there’s subtle victim shaming. Some comments are similar. People need to be educated on the dynamics of abuse and how this kind of manipulation works. ‘Grooming’ is a real thing and so is ‘mind control’. One is heavily coerced to stay in such a compromising situation. / []
Why is the sound volume so low? / []
😢 / []
😂 You agreed to those arrangements. You had a choice & that was your choice. We don't need your crap story!!! Look at you!! / ['7 years old agreed and had a choice?? She was abused and did not have a choice as a child. She was already heavily psychologicaly damaged by the age of 14, 15.']
Virginia:  I know you are no longer walking this earth but you are in our thoughts and prayers and no one will let you down!  Your bravery and courage is an armore I wish to carry!  RIP angel❤️ / []
Virginia is a beautiful soul I wish she hadn’t experienced abuse sexual and emotional ever 😢😢😢😢 Virginia my heart breaks for you I wish you could have found peace safety and comfort happiness / []

It's not fair to her to say she killed herself. A time bomb was planted when she was 8 years old. When Maxwell targets her at 16 the clock started until it finally exploded as she was writing a book. Whatever chance she had for people to help her at the end, it never happened. It wasn't possible for reasons we may never know. She might or might not have known it herself. There are many protected people who caused this. And from the story she told, this group is continuing to murder these vulnerable people. Another kind of slaughterhouse. / []
I am so sorry. What a lovely, beautiful girl. Those guys were monsters both psychopaths because no normal person could ever do that to anyone! She was as bad as him. / []
Rip sweet heart your home now with jesus 🙏💗💗💗💗 / []
The most horrific sad part is her husband changed over time and he assaulted her. How can a living being take this much of a pain and heartbreak. She was separated from her own kids. This is an old interview when her marriage was good. May be he got sold out to the rich or they threatened him. Never know. But kudos to her bravery and the tolerance! Her courage is very motivating for who cry for small little downs in their life.🙏🏻 / []
Has it ever come to her mind that it was not her father's normal reaction to take her to a complete stranger's home? Hasn't she ever thought that her father sent that woman to her workplace, and her father was the PIMP who was paid by Epstain for his daughter's services? All this is so fishy, and it starts in the family. She should have investigated her father first. She was sold by her father first, not by the strangers who had her parents' permission, obviously, and did what they wanted without even being questioned by her family. Her family are ABUSERS NUMBER 1 to start with. / []
So sad she died / []
Virginia was extremely brave, and intelligent, and clearly she cared deeply about other people, but also, she was a person.  She was a human being.  They treated her like she was nothing.  As I listen to the audiobook of "Nobody's Girl", by far, the hardest part for me to hear, is when she speaks in glowing terms about her husband and family, because I know that it was her husband's actions who caused her to die by her own hand.  She went from being abused by her father, into the hands of others and eventually Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, to a marriage to a man who abused her.  I already knew about Epstein, Maxwell, Prince Andrew and others... but the fact that she wrote the book, talking about how wonderful her life was now, was the hardest thing to hear.  Rest in peace, Virginia. / ['We need to find out who the Prime Minister was, and who the statesman that was from New York to Florida', '@michellewahl4756 No doubt!']
maybe her dad got her in this trap.. knowing exactly what they were up to and who they were .the father agreed while she was so young...that's odd....just saying...because these rich people could get a skilled massage therapist  but they chose a young girl..no experience? come on makes no  sense to me...her dad never questioned that? sounds sus to me .. / []
Epstein paid with his life for all his evil deeds rightfully so , God Bless this woman who lost her life and whole future way before her time for the heinous crimes committed against her which Virginia could not handle any longer in life  .

I don’t get it, money is only a way to get food water shelter and security of those things.

She wasn’t seen as a human but now she’s without a doubt one of the most important humans that can reveal how much our society has failed. A lot of men have come around but I hope we do well enough to not allow such wealth gaps to even exist. People can’t be in desperation for food water shelter and security of those things. That’s what makes people so vulnerable to abuse.

And what do the Windsors do? They strip him from some of his 'Royal privileges". Not by having him locked up forever but by stripping him of some of his privileges, symbolically.

I really detest it when people ask an abused person why they didn’t just run away from their offender. When you’ve been abused early in life, your self worth is pretty low, and you tend to simply  ‘give in’  to the situation. Your brain says "here we go again, so hurry up and get this over with". After years of abuse your brain tends to associate sex with getting what you want. If you give in to the abuser, you will get to keep a job and maybe even get promoted, or hang out with the cool crowd for example. It’s a spiral. I was in my early 50’s and suffering awful depression and low self esteem before I took control of my life.  I’m so sad this woman isn’t here anymore. 😢 / ['I think that’s why she did ask her if she was being the devils advocate so people won’t ask']
Such a heartbreaking story. Release the files. This dead woman and her family deserve the truth. Her parents need to be brought to task too.

I know now that i am elderly and experienced a low income version of what she experienced and later worked with children in the foster system that it isn’t only predators but opportunists that even our facial expressions unwittingly give away clues to that we are vulnerable.  The Villages’ neglect is what gives the opportunists and preditors means and often also the motives for. We have not funded the foster system in this Country in forever. In late 1800s the San Francisco orphanages had baby bodies stack up on their back porches cause coroners couldn’t come quick enough (Gold Rush had caused population boom for one thing ). Abused adults not only have to learn we also have to unlearn like those with “Good enough” parents and/or community (the latter can offset the former..not in her case and moving children around a lot is one way they go under “The radar” which isn’t much radar anyway. / []
I'm so proud of her! ❤ / []

I honestly hate to say it, knowing what she went through and how sadly her life ended, but a big part of this interview is not convincing and in parts doesn’t make sense! 🤔 Seems a bit “over explained” and just “off” in a way! Maybe it’s just me… 🤷🏻‍♂️ / []
*1:18** In her book she says her father abused her and that he allowed his friend to abuse her.* / ['Yes, a guy called Forrest, apparently.']
I'm continuing to watch this. Virginia gets depressed about what is being done to her. Epstein is displeased and traffics her to somebody  who's physically cruel. This is a real horror story with real life wealthy and powerful monsters. How does this creature Ghislaine get pardoned? how about capital punishment being reserved for these monsters? / []
Every human being must stand up to the elites..... only way to save the mind, and the planet, is to delete elitism.

I'm really sick of interviewers starting with "How could you....?" If you've never dissociated in your life because of trauma, THAT'S how "could you." No media ever is mindful or empathetic enough to have a psychologist in the room when this line of questioning happens. And even then, I have been abused by a therapist who just wanted stories and had absolutely no interest in my well being or my road to recovery. All of you who ask this question in this same way are just "lookie-loos" who treat everything like it's a car accident. For every moment Virginia felt shame, I wish 1000 fold on every interviewer, every lawyer, every cop and every man/woman on the street who says "well, I wouldn't have done that or this or I would've run away!" It's called dissociation and it is a survival mechanism that is almost primal. There are no human words or language to make you understand. / []
The truth will come out brave girl. Rest in peace.🙏 / []
How does a little girl, 3yesrs old get up, get ready to be abused everyday. All day, Constant touching and grooming, also affection, special attention, gifts?  The entire school year, morning and night for years? U compartmentalized, u escaped, u made up stories and imaginary friends. U survived.

Why did she stay for 20 years with a husband who beat the crap out of her when she had enough money to escape completely?  No judgement, I am just wanting to know the thought processes behind this.

Virginia's testimony opens the pit of hell, which is what Epstein, Maxwell  were doing..An organisation catering to Satanists,  all wealthy,  poweful  men..As she said, these are our leaders,  our rulers, we are meant to admire & respect them. But they are Luciferians..Epstein was a Mossad agent, intelligence services have kept most offenders protected.  They probably killed Virginia. The baby they wanted her to gove them, would have been a sacrifice at one of their ceremonies. Global crime cartel of evil & wickedness of such magnitude. Ordinary people don't want to believe it is happening,  but those who supported it, the medical staff, the household workers, the drivers, they all knew. / []

When a little girl is abused by a loved one, she will be told "don't tell anyone". Then another abuse happens and she is told "I love you so much". Eventually, in her mind she expects the abuse and feels sad if it doesn't happen. She wonders if she did something wrong or maybe that person doesn't like her anymore. It's very sad, the abuse stays on indefinitely.😢 / []

These abusers have a network and people in high places they have compromat on to keep those people from ever telling others.  I hope all the names are released, but I fear it won't happen.  Nevertheless, we've got to keep pressing to try and get the Epstein files released.   Trump kept the FBI from doing a full investigationn on Brett Kavanaugh and the multiple women who had claims of his having sexually abused them.  The way it works is that, now Trump owns a supreme court justice and has lifetime protection. / []

I am so sick, tired, disgusted that these powerful men get away with abusing and/or trafficking women over and over.. R Kelly, P Diddy, Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and on and on.. this is still happening all over the world right now!! Women coerced or forced into sexual slavery or servitude.. CHILDREN!!!

I blame her stupid parents.  Are you kidding me? My 14 year old is traveling the world with two strangers??? Holy cow / ['They had already advised her.

Sad thing I knew that virginia would not make it ,thats the sadness either she would  unalive herself or someone would get to her,her passing came as no shock to me . the trauma she has carried from childhood to adult i pray she is at rest at last , May her children really grow up always being proud of their mum she was a remarkable ,resilient, Courageous woman. / []
Die monsters gebruiken de cognitieve dissonantie om zijn slachtoffers te misbruiken. De slachtoffers worden zo verward door de plotseling wijziging van de situatie dat ze bevriezen. Vreselijk.

This eloquent brave woman. RIP. / []
I do wonder what her parents were doing to let her travel the world at that young age after what had happend. / []
Wow! I hope Virginia is happily resting in peace! She did a heroic job in putting some of these sociopaths in jail, and kicking them out of “The Palace”! May the other guilty ones stop, and take accountability now! Thank you, great show!😊❤ / []
What a heartbreaking story how shameful and disgusting these people used such vulnerable person . The files need to be exposed whoever was involved need to be exposed for justice to be served / []
Someone killed her.  She is a strong women / []
Epstein was involved in a lot more than just abusing minors. What about the human cloning and supply of innicent people for ritual sacrifice by the the ones who run this world. Thats way above Australian police pay grades. / ['Police are the foot soldiers for these rulers.']
She was so brave and calm…I understand  her marriage was also abusive.  If that is true,  I am so sorry! / []
Justice for Virginia. 💜 / []
She’s so intelligent. What a different life she’d have had if she had born in a loving and supportive family. / []
What a life, what a great woman! Thank you also to the very good interviewer. / []
I feel every ounce of her pain, through her voice, her eyes, her reliving it! People just don’t understand the trauma!!! Imagine being a small 10 year old girl laying in bed every single night not knowing your fait. Every noise, a tree, the wind, the cars, is it him? Crying, drowning in fear, barely breathing just so you can hear. Making evacuation plans daily, telling yourself you are going to fight back, forgetting you have no chance against the beast?? It’s just a small part, from the eyes of a survivor, remember this is before being touched, 5 years, 365 days a year, some 366. literally trembling every single night!!! Then you are left to pick up the pieces alone!!! I will always cherish Virginia, her fight was real, her courage had no bounds, her bravery should be shared far and wide! Australia should have protected her with grace and dignity? WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO VIRGINIA ? JUSTICE FOR VIRGINIA!!!! / []
Virginia Giuffre is a case of very suspected suicide. Epstein was mordered. She was an employee in the property management of the Mar-a-Lago hotel complex of the later US President Donald Trump in Palm Beach. There she worked in the wellness area, where she is said to have been approached by Ghislaine Maxwell at work in 1998. Epstein and Maxwell ran a sex trafficking ring involving minors. / []
I have the same problem with times and ages.  I have to remember things by events, like what event came first, then,  to deduce an approximation of the  year, or age,  from there. / []
From this angle there is question in her expression. Why it wasn’t voiced or action taken is the question. / []
What a brave woman. I can't really imagine the horrors she must have been through. May her soul rest in peace. And may all these pedophiles all over the world finally get their just punishment. It is unbearable that the Epstein files are covered up again and probably that's just the tip of the iceberg 🧊. Virginia ❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Nice doesn't really mean Nice for these people 😊 / []
Utterly devastating. A stark warning to listen to and believe in people when they are alive. If justice had been served in time, she might have been saved. Ghislaine should never be free. / []

Where were the parents of these girls ?  I just can’t understand   The parents were just as guilty as the predators   They gave their children away !  I simply cannot understand how it could happen   One doesn’t normally leave a 12 years old out of sight ?  There is a missing link / ['The families are often complicit in it, because one or more of them are abusers.', 'Family abusers are prevalent']
People like trump and Epstein both heavily use and rely on NDA's Powerful people can use non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to hide illegal activity because they leverage threats of severe financial penalties, legal costs, and potential lawsuits, which can intimidate victims into silence despite NDAs not legally preventing someone from reporting a crime. Although an NDA cannot legally prevent reporting illegal acts, powerful individuals and corporations can abuse these contracts by making them seem legally binding and by making the consequences of a violation seem worse than they might actually be.   So explain, how is it that a NDA can still hold victims liable in this country even if they are breaking it due to illegal activity?  Make that make sense? / []
Thank you, 60 Minutes Australia. We must keep the pressure on. News and events can disappear amidst the constantly-emerging scandals and dreadful behavior from the US presidential administration, but we can't give up on justice for these women. These accusations encompass multiple countries and people, and already at least one victim will never get any kind of recompense. / []
This is so heartbreaking to listen to. This poor girl never stood a chance right from birth😢 she was so brave right to the end😮I hope there is peace and safety where she is now😢 / []
Poor girl, I saw a glimpse of this world of wealth and people who all crawl around worshipping money. Young beautiful girls are currency, it is disgusting. Value the normal, the everyday and the decent. If you have a normal life, people who love you and a decent place in the world you have won at the game of life. / ['Luciferians rule,  that world of glamour is actually evil beyond what ordinary people could comprehend']
Those Epstein files may never get released and even if they do there is no guarantee they aren't  "doctored'. And we may never know everyone on that list but you can guess the owner of Marologo knew what was going on and even participated. Thank you Virginia for having the courage to speak up. RIP.

And where on earth was her family, her parents? / ['Abusers in the family', 'If her father was an abuser, he was complicit with.what happened']
It seems that the only man who is being held accountable is/was Prince Andrew and that is being done by his brother, the King of England but not by any court of law.   I guess Bill Gates also has been held accountable  by the fact that his wife found out about his association and divorced him but not by any court of law. / ['These offenders own the law.

Virginia’s parents failed her more than once; they didn’t protect her from the family friend’s abuse starting at 7. Then her dad handed her to total strangers at the age of 16 to travel the world.  Her parents were negligent!  They are guilty too. Poor girl 😢 / ['Her own father started the abuse when she was a child.', "Yeah guilty parents for sure, I've never even had kids but if so they'd be protected from anything like this, how can adults let young daughters go do this kind of work in the first place, its mind boggling to fuck for me to imagine it, she's gone from this shitty life and hopefully she's in a happy paradise like place now.", '@Riviera1777did she mention that in her book?

I feel indescribable watching this. That it went on in public and that nobody stopped it. The girl, I feel I wish I could’ve saved. This world is such a mixed up place / ['Luciferians run the world']

It's more corrupt than most could believe, unless having had a personal experience from a young age until now of how corruption can damage lives .  Protecting names of  the wealthy & influtial ,That will make sure their victims lives are HELL / []
Very sad 😢 / []
The more decent people all over the world speak up about loud and clear supporting the amazing Virginia's courage, the sooner the Epstein files will see daylight and justice for victims of sexual abuse and sex trafficking will finally be done.  Keep the story in the media constantly by letting your cry for justice for the real victims of entitled billionaires and royalty be done. Support Virginia and her fellow victims.  Then Virginia won't have died in vain but celebrated  forever for her courage. She earned her right to be in world history books forever! ❤💪❤ Virginia! / []

When l found out Andrew got her SS#  l knew it was not suicide but Andrew  ! / []
A young female family member was abused by her cousin from when she was six years old until she was 12, the male cousin was 14 when it started and around 19, when it stopped, due to her being able to avoid him easier as she got older From a really happy well behaved little girl who was very intelligent in regard to her school work, she became a troublesome child and became very rebellious and ended up being excluded from two separate secondary schools, while her family had no idea why her personality had changed so much. After keeping her dark secret for some 20 years, and after having moved away from the area she grew up in, she contacted her abuser on social media in attempt to find some closure.  The abuser responded and pretty much admitted his guilt and apologised.   Some months later after careful consideration she decided to take this information to the police and he was arrested.  He was found guilty by an unanimous jury verdict and was given a custodial sentence of seven and a half years, which was later reduced to five on appeal. Some 10 years later, after having her life and educational opportunities lost and ruined, she's still waiting for a compensation settlement from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. / ['😢hope the young girl gets justice she deserves ❤', 'Thats devastating its hard to even imagine how it must feel for a young girl to have her whole life controlled like this,without even any parents to turn to, they should feel so useless and guilty about all this.

When someone is abused at a young age, they don't develop the power to say "no" and their ability to discern is stunted.

Here’s one person that I believes every word you’ve said, and you won’t tell it all for some reason probably because of who’s in office right now. The best comment that I can make right now is I’m glad that he’s not around anymore he can’t hurt anybody anymore and you stopped him whether you believe it or not it was you that stopped him and you’re stopping others on the list. I wish you Had put everybody’s name on the list before you passed away if we get one more off the street that would be great. I know it’s too late to say I’m sorry they treated you like a dog and they still are. You’re passing is really breaking my heart since you left but you’ll never get to see my words. / []

So tragic ,waste of what should have been a beautiful life .She went through Hell / []
Virginia's parents are very much to blame  for her situation. They did not protect their daughter, they did not question anything about her life!

And Maxwell might be out soon, this is a disgrace for the world. Rest in peace Virginia. / []
She was able to escape her abusers and regain her life.  I don’t believe she killed herself. / ['Not completely. Her husband abused her too.']
Why would she name Andrew but refuse to name the many others? / []
I was young once and was in questionable situations that involved money and my instincts saw the red flags and I got myself out of those situations. I had excellent instincts and I was not mesmerized by wealth unlike these girls  where money, wealth and impressions of these so called powerful people! / []
She said her contribution is one piece of the picture like a puzzle. I’ve read her book, her interviews, including this brilliantly conducted one. I have watched interviews of Andrew, who surely deserves to be behind bars. I have watched both of the Netflix Series “Filthy Rich” Virginia concluded her book by saying she hope she can make the difference in just one life,  make a small dent in stopping monsters.  I believe her story and her book are not one piece  but the framework, the border of the puzzle. She outlines the beginning of a horrific picture. Her life was riddled with horror, her children, her greatest blessing. There are a lot of people who should be in prison. / []
In her death, the general public and voter's can't throw that sacrifice to the side.  We all must demand answers and set a foundation so many others will receive protection, empathy and their abusers will be stopped. I hope she can RIP🕊️ knowing they all deserve justice.  Most of us don't realize it happens in our own communities. We all need to remove the blinders. / []

would like to see this interview viewed through the eyes of a psychologist.  some odd facial presentation.  Looking down and to the left while explaining can indicate an internal dialogue or self-talk, where a person is thinking through what they are saying to themselves.

Start from the bottom and they will speak the names out loud who touched them or visited that island.  There will be no hiding for anyone.  This has gone on long enough, the man is deceased no one to protect JUST SAY THE NAMES  the americans could demand her black book, send in the cia and collect it / []
Trump and Epstein are equally guilty. / ['lot of names you missed there']
Never! / []
Where were your parents ???? / []
Not a friend of the family in the first place. Her father... / []
What does it take to make these monsters pay for their evil inflictions ?  Even when there's stacks of evidence against them , they get away with it .  What message is this sending out to society , to victims ? to paedophiles? Makes my blood curdle I suffered many decades of abuse of all kinds , so I am feeling her every word  She was so brave to speak out against "giants" I just wish the justice system wasn't corrupt  I know of the courage it takes to speak out and the fear that stays with you daily for life Breaks my heart she isn't here,  her freedom came too late..........but she is free now / []
I don't find some of what she said in this interview to be believable. / []
So saddening. I pray she’s at peace now. / []
When is this from? / ['2019']
Oh so utterly disgusting how this young girl lived her life; started with the abuse of her father. How she never ended her life earlier; poor Virginia.  These beasts need to be dealt with. / []
She could say NO 😮 / []
The whole system from start to finish, failed this girl / woman. Such a sad story. RIP Virginia. / []
Poor girl. / []
Rest in power, beautiful angel. The fact that Maxwell is in a cushy prison for some of the most heinous crimes a person could commit, while mothers and fathers who have committed crimes of survival are given full sentences in the worst prisons - and never moved somewhere better - makes it very clear that the corrupt justice system has always and continues to support this particular trafficking ring (keep in mind, the first non-Epstein ring Virginia was trafficked in was successfully busted). How on earth does a monster like Ghislaine Maxwell get transferred to a prison that has art, yoga, community gardens, and puppies? Never forget that justice has not been served for the harm Epstein and Maxwell caused children - C-H-I-L-D-R-E-N. In fact, a woman has died (and one of the accused is allegedly* dead) since they began actually investigating this trafficking ring.  *Epstein did not kill himself, he’s still alive. / []

Why not just go to a regular massage therapist school?? I guess the money was the motivation. Very sad. In every way.

Where were her family when this sex trafficker had her in his presence? Was she abducted and held against her will? I honestly do not understand her family's behavior in her abuse. / []
It’s the same reason young kids join gangs. They usually have unstable, dysfunctional or non existent families, have low self esteem and want to feel needed and accepted. / ['I was one of those kids but I didn’t join a gang', '(no education)']
I don't understand why even here she doesn't name any names 😮 / []
I was sceptical at first she took her own life. Because of the suspicion around Epstein. But it seems she was just in to much pain. Which breaks my heart for the poor girl. / ['She fought harder dragons than family court. She didn’t kill herself because of family court she was killed.

59:10 A 17-year-old female is legally considered a minor/girl.  so what is your question here more specifically young women are 18 + she claimed she was 17 years old which legally she wasn't " young woman " as the interviewer asked the question.  She asked about what age? vague question why? / []
I’m sure Virginia was silent similar to Epstein whilst he was in jail (Epstein death was justified) but not Virginia as this was a tragedy / []

A party of grown ups, no one asked the little girl If she needs help what she's doing there? I'm glad I'm a poor humble man that helped every little kid I came across that needed help... / []
So much evil work that is happening in this world. / []
I don't get why she had ANY relationship with her father when he was working with her at Mar a Lago. Like "Just forget it all. You're my dad who drives me places and shows concern for me."   However, my sister was severely physically abused by my father ( I never challenged him) and always sought his love and tried to have a relationship with him. I just hated him and saw him as a weak bully, expected nothing from him and received nothing and was glad when he died.   But I did more foolish things at 21 than Virginia at 17 due to having no self worth and feeling powerless.   So maybe Virginia was just grateful for any crumbs from him..... and anyone. / []

"How is this not being talked about?. How is this even happening?"  This entire interview is just heartbreaking.  Adults who should have been protecting her failed her over and over again. To see this now, after she passed at just 41, is even more heart wrenching, because she is so full of life and carries the strength of her convictions, even after such horrendous abuse.  I just hope that the full truth comes out sooner than later and those responsible are held accountable. / ["Agreed, including the truth about her death. There's no way she committed suicide - after being in touch with Eblob Muskrat just before she died?!? She was likely murdered by Russian agents, just like Epstein and Jean-Luc Brunel. All suicides?

Part of me doesn't believe she took her own life. But, after getting paid by the Royal Family to shut up, I can see the disappointment, the "I don't matter". I know that feeling all too well. I battled an eating disorder most of my life. The one thing no one can control. The second time I was an in-patient, after a PNA stalked me for months, then showed up at my apartment at 12:30 am. The rest you know. The hospital wouldn't take me back, basically saying I deserved it. I was sleeping most of the time by then. A nurse came in, talked for a bit, and we shared a banana. He was severely overweight. I came to rely on him, and a couple other patients. He saved my life. / ['SHE SAID BEFORE SHE DIED.

If Trump released those files there would be a lot of vacancies in top jobs in the government. All those involved would definitely say it was untrue, inaccurate and be denied with years in the courts. Just like Trump statement of a hoax. These people think they are above the law and that it didn't apply to them. Trump and Epstein were best friends for decades before the falling out. With the businesses that Trump bankrupted were would he even get a loan? From a bank ? Maybe think about that last part. / []

My heart and spirit breaks for her and all the others. One of the hardest parts is that she took her life, after seeing her so brave in this interview, she must have felt betrayed once again. Her husband, such an abuser of her himself and not letting her see her children, let's us know how let down she was her whole life. I hope if there is an afterlife that she can see that we are not letting this go and hopefully soon all of the predators will be held accountable.

I believe Epstein groomed the people on his list, was probably working on some powerful  people for a long time, then he used the opportunity to exploite them.  I will say it's funny how quiet Hollywood is about this poor young women,  avictim of a Mossad operation in the US.  She died in odd circumstances too. / ['Why do you think it is mossad?

This interview is haunting.  Interviewer: “How are things now?” Virginia: “Life is good. Life is great.”  Then she commits suicide? I don’t think so.  She TOLD us if anything ever happened to her, it was because they finally got to her.  She’s right.  It’s a 100 billion dollar industry, probably more. Grown men crying because they WON’T be stopped from sexually abusing children. They will not be stopped and if you try, they will crop you out.  We need Jesus. / []
This is terrible, extremely disturbing.  I don't know how these evil people could abuse this poor girl and the others like this. And to think ghislane maxwell isn't in maximum security is disgusting.

At 17 she could have said "NO". / ['A normally healthy person could have said „no“, but believe me, when you have been abused as a child, the child is made to believe it’s their fault, that they deserve it, that they’re unworthy and this follows you all your life.

How stupid and naive she was. / []
My heart is breaking listening to Virginia😢. God bless her soul, I cannot imagine her pain and suffering.   Epstein, Maxwell and Mr. Mountbaton Windsor are exactly where they should be. / []
The way she describes reacting and feeling during and after being assulted rings true, its the exact same as what i did and how i felt when it happened to me. I was 15 at the time. / []
To simplify, she wanted to please them. Due to her childhood traumas that is how she found self gratification. It doesn't make it any less abusive. / []

Very sad that just when she had found happiness, she had built this great life for herself in Australia, she got roped into the scandal again and died so young RIP she is a very beautiful and courageous woman / ['Courageous she didn’t kill herself']
Every single woman who was abused by someone in power, but refuses to give a name, is a frecking coward. Seriously? Your personal safety is more important than bringing this whole system of abuse down? All these men abusing their power and you let this go without mentioning their name? If that is the case the one who was abused is just as responsible for the abuse going on. / ["Fiona Barnett in Australia,  has named names, including Antony Kidman,  Nicole's father. But no one gets charged,  because people in high places protect the evildoers & many of them are also Luciferians."]
I think if Epstein is actually dead whoever killed him knew there was no way he would face justice because he had to much blackmail on people & he had money to get him out of anything. They did the world a huge favor. Maxwell shouldn't receive comfy accommodations she should be in a regular prison like anyone else & do her 10 years for what she did to these girls. / []
60 Minutes USA should air this interview on Prime Time Sunday Evening and demand the Government release the Epstein Files. May this tragic story have a “Happy Ending” for all the victims.  God Bless our Heroine Virginia Giuffre.  SAY HER NAME.  Amen. 🙏☮️🇺🇸❤️‍🩹 / []
Sorry, but I do not believe that she took her own life.  This should be investigated as the murder that it was. / []

At this time, Ghislaine and Epstein were like parental figures to Virginia sadly.  At 16/17 years old she clearly thought she should do as she was told by these powerful people. / []
Watching this makes me sick and furious!! The Epstein files need to be released NOW!  The Monsters who participated (and probably continue to participate in sex trafficking). NEED TO BE EXPOSED AND PUNISHED! / []
Incredibly sad. RIP Virginia. However I’m unsure how Naomi Campbell could be expected to gauge that you were 17 and not say 21… / []

Such a truly amazing woman to have exposed the horrendous things she had to go through because of Epstein and Maxwell.  Such a sad thing to know what she and many other young girls went through without any pedophiles being prosecuted for their horrendous crimes.  Trump is not releasing the Epstein Files because he knows what happened and Trump is just as guilty as Epstein...

This is literally the tip of the Iceberg .... The children & women used by Einstein were treated well compared to the horror of the wider trafficking and underground tunnels and networks and what happens there .  The trafficking cartels are supported by government agencies and their money is processed by the main financial system...   If this interview and the idea of someone like Einstein shocks you... Learn about the power that rules the world & what they practice... The torture of millions of children per year is a part of the system you live in, work in, vote for and pay taxes for..  60 minutes is MSM giving you a distorted toned down version of the reality of this problem.. It's worse than you can possibly imagine...  But if you care - turn off the MSM and go and find truth - you will know when you find it... / []

I feel so terrible for her that she didn't live to see Andrew's fall from grace. I wish she could have kept fighting and pushing, but I will not begrudge her the choice she made, because abuse on that level... I can't even fathom the pain it leaves behind. My abuser died and I can say that all those emotions - rage, anger, sadness over the fact that they got out of a true punishment all came to me swiftly too. Rest easy, Virginia. I can only hope that we finally RELEASE THE FILES and get these men held accountable for their sickness. Hopefully we make it so uncomfortable that these disgusting pieces of trash never hurt another child again. / []

This story is heartbreaking. How Virginia live to age forty - one is a miracle, given all that she had been through.

such a touching interview / []
All of the files/evidence need to be released, because that is the undisputed documentation (videos, recordings, etc.) of the abuse these girls experienced by the men who abused them. The victims, if they reveal the names first, will be subject to lawsuits and threats which these men know the victims can't afford to endure or fight. Either threats to them and their families and financially. These men know this and so do their protectors. With this administration, I hope there are still files to be released. R.I.P.

I'm sorry, but who didn't abuse her in her life, apart from her brother? Some things she says don't make sense. A ''family friend'' who had access to her day and night?

Is there any explanation as to why her father was never charged? / ['No, but probably because it happened too long ago and nobody has reported him to the police.']
Posh now days means cruel , criminal , narcist, people users  At least in my view / []
What a disgusting and sad  life this poor woman had.  Her damn parents failed her and set her on this path for this abusive life.  And to think children all over this effin world go through this every day. / []

It’s absolutely horrific what kind of life she lived due to predators her entire life! Rest now beautiful soul ❤️ Thankyou so much for speaking out for all victims and may God bless you forever 🌸 / []
Can’t understand why her parents did nothing! / []
Justice for Virginia, justice for all other victims. Every single one of the abusers, from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to every single other she mentions politicians, scientists, actors everyone should end up in jail. All of this has to be finally stoped, all of the abusers prosecuted, and all this horrible s@x trafficking industry has to finally end! We all have to keep calling for justice, keep speaking about this, keep protesting! Untill not only the Epstein files are released but all of the abusers are prosecuted and end up in jail! This is monstrous what she went through, it's so heartbreaking and mortifying to hear and read about this. Poor Virginia, poor all the victims. She was so incredibly brave to speak up, to talk about all the trauma she went through, to take on all of those powerful people - the most powerful people on this planet! They think they won, because she finally couldn't hold it together and committed so@icide - poor poor woman so hurt, so undeservedly. But she will win in the end, every single decent person on this planet has to keep standing up for her, demand justice and punish all abusers and enablers involved in this! / []

Am i the only one here who wants to know where TF her parents were? She's running away constantly, traf- ficked to where the police came to get her and whomever else was in that first person's house, allowed to travel the world without their supervision as a teenager, and NOW they want to know what she was up to? NOW they want answers? Y'all were failures and caused this. / ["\u200b@DezzieJeeright, that's my point. They're not good parents and now they want answers. Its baffling to me.

QUESTION : HOW OLD WAS SHE AT THE TIME TO BUY A BOOK ABOUT THERAPEUTIC MASSAGE  ???😴😴😴 / []
It seems Virginia had a problem with discipline and abuse. She seems to have a problem wherever she was... Why is this. Was everyone an abuser?? It seems she chose the lifestyle Epstein offered her rather than be homeless or try to make things work with other family members... It is reported in another video she kept on going to Epstein every 2 weeks. / ['Peak victim blaming. Your lack of empathy is astounding.']

Sounds like she was a perpetual victim for some reason..why bring it all up only to commit suicide..What a way to make a final morbid impact 🪦 / []

Im listening to her book, I have to listen in bits, it's so traumatic, this girl didn't stand a chance. / []
This is very real. I believe every word. I remember being a teenager. This is real, this is Truth! / []
As sad as the outcome of this story is, and I only know part of it, not the entire thing, I'm just puzzled and wondering why didn't this woman try to make a run for it and seek help?? If she was being trafficked from one man to another and another, didn't she make any attempt to get away when she knew what all was happening? Was she held hostage and/or her life threatened if she squeaked? Why did she go along with it for so long? / ['She said they threatened her.

I read the book and it all makes sense now... God bless her. She is now a spiritual warrior from the other side. ❤ / ['💯', 'I just finished it, this was a perfect interview!😢❤']
Sexual abuse on the victims takes an awful toll. But I just can’t accept this report of suicide. For the sake of seeing justice done wouldn’t you want to live? Knowing the nature of these murderous self protective elites I wouldn’t be surprised if they engineered her murder in an effort to protect their ‘reputation’. There are scores of girls AND BOYS  here in 🇨🇦 who need to be rescued. Canada is a hypocrite. They act like they are free of this but it is widespread worldwide.  My adult son was recognized by Jayzee and wanted his beats & lyrics from Bandcamp & another social showcase - and he went to LA. He was approached by these absolutely soulless strange people that insisted he do their bidding in order to showcase his talents. He sensed an evil vile presence & refused. His life became strangely rough & violent & we had to rescue him as he ended up in hospital. LA is loaded with evil. No matter what someone says-don’t allow your loved ones there unless you go along with them & protect them. Trafficking is basically everywhere. / []
This woman as a young girl was dominated and abused by Epstein that damaged her within so bad she committed suicide last year but still managed to get the message out about being trafficked by Jeffery Epstein like hundreds of other young girls. / ['It started with her own father and other men who abused her.']

So let me get this clear. She was assaulted by family friend, then her father got her a job where trafficking was taking place? Are there any additional facts about that? This coincidence already is uncanny.  Such a shame there was no parental guidance. Seems like her dad was making money of her and consenting to it. Travel the world alone, approached by an adult and offered a job at 13? This didn’t seem right since the beginning and I’m only 8mins into the video. It is insanity to me that in the country with highest human trafficking rate, children are allowed to go to ‘work’. In most of Europe you can’t work until you legally become an adult which is 18yo. It’s not as much as vulnerability in children as they all are, it’s naivety of parents. Adults don’t get drove back after their interviews home, let alone children. / ['Read her book. Her father was the first one to rape her regularly. He started when she was 7 years old. Then he got one of his adult friend to rape her. The mom did nothing to her or protect her.

Wonder if the Queen saw this 60 minutes episode?  This came out in 2019… three years before she passed. / ['Like she would give a stuff.\n\nThe royalty think they are above everyone......']

Read Nobody’s Girl and commend Virginia for having the courage to come forward and letting the world know what happened.

I truly feel for this woman   But WHY. Did she stay????   It's clear it was NOT RIGHT   even to a 17 year old / ['The reasons for no escape could have been… she was thousands of miles from home, did she even have access to her own passport? Did she even have a home to return to? Years of abuse meant that this life was now normalised for her. Years of abuse meant that her self worth was at rock bottom.\n\nThere’s a reason why the abuse took place on island in the Caribbean or across the Atlantic. That’s how slavery worked for centuries. It’s easier to keep someone against their will when they are miles from home.', 'If you are raised in a supportive caring family you can’t begin to understand what being raised in a dysfunctional family does to you.', 'When people ask this question - it shows ignorance. Please educate yourself on victims and what happens to them psychologically - the dynamics that are involved are off the scale -', '\u200b@irenekemp70 listen I personally could have fallen victim to someone well known and powerful \nat an aven younger age \n\nI stopped it all on their first attempt.', '@sharoncommon4743 but did you already have a history of being attacked?

Thank you so much for this interview. Remarkable journalist. I can finally understand Virginia story.   So basically Former Prince Andrew was just one amongst very rich powerful clients.

All the comments here sympathizing with this demon's tall tales of victimhood confirm for me that this must be hell and we must all be fallen angels. This woman is pure evil.  no doubt in my mind that Epstein was a womanizer and user.  Maybe ghislaine served him in locating young female volunteers.  Probably.  But in no way do I believe she was abused.  Absolutely not. I see a volunteer in her.  A very willing volunteer. I was her age when she started volunteering to learn 'massage' as she calls it.  I was that age.  And I was dumb as a doornail.  And even I would have had the sense to speak and back out of the volunteer massage when it started to look creepy.  She continued to engage.  And did so hundreds of times.  Volunteered.  No chains. No jail. No guns. No duress.  She wanted to be around rich people, travel without having to pay,  get male attention and money , and marry a rich guy. Its that last thing she could never accomplish which is why she is attacking them.  She is trying to collect what she feels KS due her for her time.  A rich man should have married her in her opinion.  He didnt.  She was resentful in later llife and decided to spin the volunteer story into 'abuse' to pump the money out of it that she feels should have been hers through marriage to one of those old perverts she volunteered to 'massage.'. What a horrible person she is. A demon.  Its terrifying to see how many people in the comments want to believe her tales with no proof of abuse and  self-admitting recollection of what in her own words describes 100% willing participation.  My god people.are evil parading as some sort of self proclaimed saints.  Pure evil on earth. / ['💯 😂']
Oh Virginia, if only you had a true friend at that time,, I wish I'd known you sweet angel 🌹♥️ / []
Sweet Virginia 💔 same happened to me at 12 from an uncle that was 20. I looked up to him and had a crush but had no idea what he did to me. I was so embarrassed and could never look at him again. I had no idea how messed up I was until by the time I was 18 I was dating a man 44 yrs old who I later after months found out he was married. When I was young I thought I was special now at 58 I realize I was groomed. I didn’t have a normal relationship until I was 40. I had outgrown their attraction to me. / []

But, no--he instead decided to inflict  himself on other people. There was positive help for him.   The US has a long history of not exposing Johns & not holding them accountable. Now A LOT of people want to know who these deviant people are & want them convicted. There is going to be intense interest in this more than likely for the rest of this century. I don't think it's going to go away ever. I couldn't believe DT actually expected it to. DT must release these names, or he's going to look bad.

She is such a beautiful girl and to have had a horrendous life then to go on to kill herself and leave her children motherless - It's heartbreaking. There's plenty more men than Andrew.

When you are abused, particularly at an early age, you are shaped to endure and be silent. That’s all you know. You don’t know any better. You are not given the keys to handle such situations later in life. Her parents did not educate her to recognise and fight abuse. She didn’t stand a chance. She was like a lamb going to the slaughter.   With an upbringing of abuse, this innocent little girl was taught to be a docile victim.   That’s why the psychology of abuse is so destructive. She did was she had been told to do. Most kids do. For those lucky enough to have had parents who taught them how to handle bad advances, it’s an entire different story.   It’s a tragic story and they all deserve justice. / ['This is true I am a survivor and I was told to keep quiet and I was threatened']
If you think what this young girl witnessed as a massage therapist did not include "extras"... you are very naive!  🤣 Since when was it legal to hire a 13 year old for a full time job, and for a lockerroom at that- anywhere,  let alone Mara Lago, or however you spell it.  Things young girl most likely has ALWAYS been abused, which is edgy she was comfortable working in a lockerroom, and wanting to be a masseus!  This whole story is prob a,ruse and a lie, just like her death is!   Ive never heard (and Im not watching this whole thing)  but Ive never heard that she was kidnapoed on that island, or trapped... she WANTED to stay and live in that n lap of luxery. She also never talks about the EXTRA EXTRA YOUNG children that were a big part of Epsteins inventory. This was his JOB, to serve the ultra rich, and this is why he is NOT dead,  most likely alive and well fulfilling his beloved job/career on some other island... / ['You make NO sense🤯', 'Yes, I agree, it was his job to serve the ultra rich and powerful in order to facilitate lucrative business transactions and power plays.', 'You know nothing ,so why are you commenting.']

The answer to why did you go back is, victims feel like they're already dirty and cheap and not going back will not clean anything or make anything better.

Something is very wrong with this story.  Why was Virginia  Giufre living in the streets hooked on drugs and trading sex for food before she even went to Mar-Lago in the first place?  She was already a teenage prostitute before she met any of these "rich & powerful" people.  Granted, when she went to Mar-A-Lago, she actually thought she could get clean and start over.  She was actually doing fairly well there and treated right.  She was targeted by Gislane  Maxwell, because Maxwell was a predator and she saw her vulnerability.  My point is, where was her family, her brother's.  Now they come forward and show so much interest and emotion?   Some teenage girls used to get taken advantage of at that age in those days, it wasn't uncommon, that's where the term young and stupid comes from?  What has to look at the big picture and decipher truth from fiction.   I think it was a far cry from trading sex from for food to sleeping with a prince of England.  The story is very sad, not because she was taken advantage of, but because she was relentlessly trying to break away from that life, and somehow she was spotted by predators like Maxwell in Epstein.   My biggest point is, where was her family all along?  Why was she living in the streets on drugs and why did you have to trade sex for food? / ["Mother was an alcoholic from what I understand, father wasn't in the picture. He worked at Mar-a-lago. but they were seperated. and brother and sister were also at home. She went her own way, ran away. Got on drugs, ended up at Mar-a-lago to get a job. Ghislaine and Epstein were recruiting girls from her high school. Told her to go back to school and get more girls for them. She did. She left Mar-a-lago and went on to be with ghislaine and epstein. They were taking care of her after she left Mar-a-lago. Finally got an apartment for herself and left them. Had to go out of the country to get away from them.", 'Nobody from her family have mentioned what happened in their home growing up.

A number of years ago I heard a statistic and I wish I can remember where, sexual abuse victims often experience abuse by multiple perps throughout their lifetime.

However, I think that guidance even now is not always seens as applicable to situations where the man is rich (if he was poor it would have been different) and the woman is disadvantaged.

Somehow some blame their circumstances for the wrongs in their life while not owning up to the fact that their choices are a major factor too. Many have faced abuse but chose to from learn from them and become wiser. This shows that we cannot entirely blame somebody else for some of the mistakes made in life. I am sure she must have been told by someone close to her to not walk that path but she chose to do it anyway. When you play with fire you will get hurt even if it’s not entirely your fault. It takes two to tango. / ["You dont't get it: she had no choice!

When Virginia brings out the photos of Naomi Campbells B day party, wow. Virginia is just a baby then and look at how she is dressed compared to all the others. Talk about putting that girl in a position where she feels utterly vulnerable and out of her element. That is also a tactic used by abusers. What Virginia says over and over in this interview is correct; all the people who were around this and knew what was going on are just as much responsible for allowing such abuses to continue to happen. I am repulsed at how much this goes on and no one will speak up. I hope justice comes in a new fashion for all of these folks. Saving your own ass at the expense of the victims of these abusers is weak human character. These people who stay silent in the face of it all, allow these perpetrators and abusers in control to not only maintain it but continue to gain power from it.

I’m just curious if her parents ever knew she was abused. If they did and they never tried to help her, they are ridiculous.

Typical predators who preyed on a young girl broken girl. Rape victims freeze emotionally and mentally regardless of a age. They become subservient and robot like. I have met rape victims who have gone through the same thing. You shut down and repeat the same pattern over and over again. They mask their way way through life. That’s why you go back and it’s a downward spiral from there. Your defences are totally eradicated. Poor girl. RIP ❤ / []

I just wish she were here to see it all. What validation and sense of relief in knowing that finally one of her damn abusers would be held to account. Maybe that could have changed her trajectory in her life. Breaks my heart how hard she tried in her life and was not able to achieve the sense of peace in her life that was not only well deserved but necessary. I hope that the tides are turning.
