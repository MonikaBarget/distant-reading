I’m giving Code Switch four stars (instead of five) simply because the podcast is US-centric in its perspective. It doesn’t address the legacy of European colonialism around the globe. 

I’m a Canadian woman of Tamil and Sinhalese origin (my parents are immigrants from Sri Lanka).

2020-05-18 13:42:51,"Code Switch is my favourite podcast! I’m a transracial adoptee from Canada and an academic, and Code Switch has been a home for me, a place where I can hear and think about issues that feel relevant and urgent to me. 

I love the diversity of topics being brought up: the show tackles events that just happened on the news; it traces the history of a term or an issue; it covers the stories of BIPOCs of all stripes; it even recommends cool books! 

I’m also a fan of the ever nuanced, empathetic, and informed approach which this podcast takes. It isn’t afraid to leave space for ambiguity, grey areas, to show how complex issues are, and to let the listeners make up their own mind. 

The hosts, Shereen and Gene, are charming, smart, and easy to relate to, and I always feel like they ask the right questions. The issues are clearly well-researched and the guests, carefully picked. I’ve learnt a tremendous amount by listening to this podcast. 

Above all, Code Switch is a show with such a big heart. I can’t tell the number of times I teared up in the middle of the street because of something beautiful and hopeful that was said on the show. The episode on transracial adoptees hit me in the feels so hard, and it made me understand myself better. Thanks Code Switch!",5,"Thought-provoking, nuanced podcast about race",effet-catharsis

2018-07-15 11:00:56,"Most eps are about how non-whites (mostly blacks) are supposedly misunderstood and oppressed for not conforming to ""dominant culture"" (i.e. whitey), and how whitey should be ashamed of himself for not massively increasing spending by billions on free stuff for ""racialized"" groups. They don't invite any normal, rational people onto the podcast to debate their insane leftist identity politics - Code Switch is all about making its listeners more ""woke"". For example, they complain that the stories about the ""word gap"" (how poor black kids start school having heard several MILLION fewer words spoken to them) are guilty of ""deficit thinking"" and unfairly using whites as the norm to compare blacks against. It gets two stars for being fun to laugh at, but this is a bad podcast and they should feel bad for making it.",2,deluded identity politics echo chamber,Tartrazine

Right from the first episode I was hooked - the conversations that are being had by the team on Code Switch immediately made me uncomfortable, but in a productive way. I started to examine my own inherent biases, to explore how I can be a better ally and to confront what my privilege means. Being Canadian, it also gives me an opportunity to explore a lot of the issues facing our neighbours to the south - so I really appreciate a lot of the historic context and explanatory commas sprinkled into each episode.

2023-09-21 18:58:37,"This is pretty easy and has nothing to do with the conspiracy theories favored by the hosts.  For starters the Biden administration argued for a special exception to be made.  And Roberts in his opinion said that it’s as reasonable to exclude the military academies as they were not a party to the case.  In other words, if someone brings suit then there will be a better time and place to adjudicate the issue.  And then there is just the basic issue that the military argument bears no resemblance to college campuses. Given the controversies and violence on college campuses today that difference may lessening.  But even with that you have non state actors driving the violence.  With respect to Harvard and UNC you had the state actors as the driver of the racism.  And no mention of the simple fact that Harvard was caught dead to rights discriminating against Asians.

2023-07-09 05:36:10,"The day I stopped listening was during an episode on Black representation in film. They were discussing horror and how we always die first (so they were saying). Someone brings up Alien and says the “Black guy dies first in Alien.” Or something to that extent. The Black guy’s name by the way is Parker. He’s played by the awesome Yaphet Kotto, an outstanding actor and character in a strong ensemble cast. Spoiler alert: he doesn’t die first. Considering it’s Yaphet Kotto, you could just get this right. Revisiting this masterpiece, I had to leave a review.

This remained true with other members of the Code Switch massive—Karen, Kumari, et al, but something isn’t clicking anymore. Really like what Parker and Lizaragga bring individually, but it’s been difficult to understand how they had to the crew.

As it is even today 50 years later I find it amazing how Whites attempt to muddy the water by any means necessary to retain power. The “Browning” of America is a very scary thing to some White people.

The intersectionality of culture, race, and socio-economics is the true gem of this show. But here is the but. Over the course of subjects tackled, on several occasions, the host present themselves as typical millennials. They pretend as if presented with the same situation, they somehow would have risen above the calamities as a change agent. And frankly, and this is of course an assumption, I don’t think they would have changed the outcome of some of the more dire topics. It’s easy to say what you would have done over a mic and several years later. My suggestion, stop pretending and be the good journalist you’ve shown yourself to be.

I had Dominican friends and partners that lived on the island and they were basically treated like any other Puerto Rican. And is it really appropriation if they came to the Island and BROUGHT us their music and our musicians needed to compete to survive? (That was really just market competition) Also, how can you “appropriate” a culture that is so similar to yours?  Where you eat the same food and speak the same language?  This is like saying someone in Ghana is appropriating from Nigeria, although they BOTH are African peoples. 

We don’t have Black vs. white racism like America so stop trying to attribute your Mainland American social ills onto our Island. Does colorism exist? Yes. In every country you can imagine…But we Puerto Rican’s do not appropriate and are NOT racist like the whites of the US.

Sadly, I find most of the episodes stretching to find some logical thread between a completely innocent social interaction and race. For example, there is an episode that explores the possibility of racist dogs? Another episode covers a South American migrant and largely focuses on the discomfort she feels when she’s asked where she is from (understandable) but it was wildly dramatic and neglected to even entertain the possibility such question could be asked innocently. Mostly, I am bothered that this podcast has found its way onto NPR’s Weekend Edition (WBUR & WGBH).

By acknowledging the standards of expectations for conduct for most, which is rarely placed upon those in power, it validates the practices in a toxic relationship that I no longer wish to participate.

Moreover, they examine issues related to race from multiple POC and geographic perspectives; they never rely on reductive black/white binary narratives.

2021-02-21 16:11:52,"I’m a white 23 year old, and I’ve lived in a city of all white people for my entire life. Until I went to college, I realized how amazing it is to have such a diverse group of people and to learn about different cultures. I’m not ashamed of who I am as a person, but I feel a person can be more interesting the more they know about the world and other people including, cultural views! So I decided to make myself more interesting out of pure love for all people. 

Recently, I’ve been struggling with the right thing to say when my acquaintances say “BLM is a joke”, “black people aren’t oppressed”, “they’re making the division worse”, “to end racism let’s not talk about it”. Now, it boils my blood, but I never know exactly what to say because whatever I do say, I want it to spark something in that person. Like immediate change! I’ve realized it’s not so easy. Listening to these podcasts have been amazing because it provides me with situations similar to ones I have been in. It provides me with the ability to just listen and develop an understanding. There are a few ideas that I have not yet come to full understanding with, but that’s ok! Even if I disagree (not saying a disagree with any points made on here) with any point on any podcast, it’s not worth taking back a star unless those hosts do not back their statements up.

It’s a term mostly used by Americans to lazy to actually think about the gender they are talking about, but it doesn’t apply to everything. Countries, for example, don’t have a gender, so saying Latinx country is wrong and sounds ridiculous. The same can be said about Latinx music or culture. Drop the X or say Latin-American countries o music when talking about things and not people. It is really distracting. For most Hispanics this is not even an issue, like not all Blacks care only about criminal justice issues, but something they move away from, which explains Trump’s improvement among Blacks and Hispanics.",3,Interesting yet not surprising,"A reviewer from Socorro, NM"

2020-11-27 13:56:01,"I knew, as a white cisgendered woman, that I needed to find more diverse perspectives to listen to- at the time, my feed was mostly white and mostly science or comedy podcasts.  I went through the back catalogue of Code Switch and was pleased to get a good mix of politics, race relations, social commentary, etc.  I like that there is a mix- while I know I need the politics and race relations discussions and welcome them, it's also nice to have other episodes thrown in- ones that aren't necessarily about the current news cycle, but are more evergreen.  I especially like the episodes about racism in other countries- there seems to be this idea that American exceptionalism extends also to racism- that we are the only country that experiences it.  By showing that other countries also experience racism, we can see that it's not just an American issue, and it can highlight how odd, if you look from the outside, racism really is.",5,It's Great!,S.

There was a lightness and a sense of ( a bit of hope) in their conversation and their voices. I noted that their voice tone was higher, faster, with more giggles.  I now see what these past years of the Trump assault, the Trump wear and tear, the  Trump fascist ( insert adjective) can do to people. It wore us down, it tired out us, it changed us in tiny ( and large) ways. This is my humble opinion, I continue to be an ardent fan of the podcast and I pray for the healing of this nation.

2020-08-20 19:41:03,"I listen to racial justice podcasts obsessively, read books by Black anti-racist educators, and follow voices of the Black community on social media. All I’m ever trying to do is educate myself, recognize my privilege, and fight to eradicate white supremacy. Though this podcast hits on the issues I care about, I just can’t stand the sheer amount of snark and nastiness in relation to substance anymore. And after weeks straight of starting an episode eagerly but stopping it before the end in annoyance, I’m finally unsubscribing and writing this review. 

I realize white people are bumbling, careless, racist fools whose needs cannot be centered in race discussions. At the same time, no one who needs to learn about the realities of racial oppression is going to get anything from hearing the hosts high five each other for thirty minutes as they see who can make the most snarky comment about how awful white people are. I just don’t get the point of that in a podcast that is essentially “Intro to Racism 101” for white liberal NPR listeners who are clueless on race. Is it intended to be funny? What?

It’s perfectly fine for there to be spaces for bipoc to let off steam about white people and the idiotic, harmful things we do. I am in full support of those spaces, and of keeping myself out of them because they’re not meant for me! But if this is a podcast that seeks to educate, to change people’s minds (especially white people’s), you gotta have more than what amounts to a couple of friends trying to out-eyeroll each other about the annoyances white people wreak on the world.

Case in point: the episode about interracial friendships. Did y’all think it was funny when you dropped your little snark line about white people who call the Black person they see at the water cooler their friend and use that as proof that they have a diverse friend group? Did you really need to include that “you know who you are” as if this caricature is widely represented? Did you think that approach would REALLY open the mind of the kind of person who does that and who most needs to change? Or were you just wanting to score points? It’s really just gross, to be frank.

Again, yes, white fragility is a serious problem and I’m not in favor of centering white emotions in talks about race. That’s not what this review is. I am hugely interested in looking at myself and my privilege critically, to deconstruct everything I know about the world so that I can try to see it without the lens of privilege. And I can say wholeheartedly that this podcast has done basically nothing to further that, even for me as a person who understands that this work is not at all easy, who embraces learning painful truths about myself. If I’m saying this, imagine how turned off the average “but I don’t see color!” white person—who we truly need to engage in media like this—is going to be when they listen.

The hosts and producers need to reconsider who this podcast is intended for. If it’s for a white audience learning about race and injustice, they need to change the tone. Sorry to tone police, but yeah. You need to work on making it less about the hosts throwing anecdotes at each other. Still call us out—we need it—but you can do it in a really effective manner if you try a little harder. If this podcast is for bipoc who need a place to laugh and cringe and rage about white people, then that’s totally cool, but please make that more explicit in the marketing for this show so you don’t scare off people who don’t know the harm of their white tears. If you want a great example of how to do the former, look at the way the hosts of Pod Save the People deliver hard realities. They don’t mince words or tiptoe around white emotions, but they pack so much substance and truth into every episode that it is always a worthwhile experience to listen.

They don’t feel well produced (with the exception of the holy land episode which was one of the best of 2020). I’m currently listening to the episode about Kamala Harris and it’s terrible. The hosts have this terrible banter and very surface level analysis. The hosts are just snarky and don’t add a lot of substance. They use sound bites from interviews and make boring comments.

2020-08-05 01:10:07,"Some of my first listens were like, “this is great!”.  I may be wrong, but the overall sentiment does not address that racism, more over prejudice in my experience, is a two-way street…. A  four-way stop sign that is ingrained in all peoples, of all ethnicities.  People are raised, how they are raised by others; families, communities, schools, religions, and they either turn out good or they turn out  bad.  
Beyond the beauty and innocence of childhood, tolerance is taught, learned and practiced, just as prejudice is taught learned and practiced.
You cannot define me as ‘Gray People’, nor can you define me as ‘Green People’, for I am neither, yet if you saw me in person, you might feel that I am one, or the other.  I do not like that this show talks about ‘xyz People’ so often and sometimes in a callous disrespectful manner.  We are all just People.
I am fortunate enough to have been raised multi-multi culturally and I embrace many philosophies, many ethnicities, many religious beliefs and more importantly the fact that we are all humans of only two species.
It would be nice to hear a more diverse, inclusive conversation once in a while.  The subjects are intriguing and educational.  The show means well.  Don't stop.

2020-06-20 21:40:02,"Code Switch helps me understand people more.  I""m mildly autistic, so all people are largely a mystery to me.

The power structure (all white, back then, surprise, surprise) failed me from first grade onward.  White kids drove me to tears, over and over, and white teachers did nothing but blame me.  So I wanted nothing to do with them. To this day, all someone has to be for me to consider tham as my people is not be mean.

So I really hate bullies.  Racists are either bullies or bully enablers.  So I hate them, too.  Code Switch encourages me by going after ignorance and more particularly racism, with good information, good reporting, good interviews.  While I""m a very willing learner, I'm a slow learner, about social things, anyway, and Code Switch has helped me catch up. 

Please give them a listen.  Please listen for at least a month.  You may not think so, but if you listen that long, their criticism isn't  as much about you as you may think.

2020-06-18 12:51:19,"This is the podcast I’ve been searching for. 

From a white Kansas farmer who is striving to be better. It hasn’t been enough to just believe in the steady match of progress, to believe that the voices of a targeted group of people are enough for the country of liberty and justice for all to correct itself. 

When you’re surrounded by a culture that avoids the hard conversations and places the ones forcing them as antagonistic to the peace of the family. It was easy to feel like your influence for change is small, that your isolation makes speaking out like yelling at clouds.

Listening to this podcast brings the harder conversations I don’t have access to in my day to day. The reminder that we are far from done and that the anger fades. Though I am entering into a busy time of year, I lean on podcasts like these to keep me connected and motivated to keep looking for other voices to boost, other perspectives to read.

What is happening recently is making me and my children so disgusted. I don’t know what to tell my 13 year old son, who has fair skin and bright blue green eyes. How should he operate in this world?  He has only known ‘mixed’ communities. But that isn’t how he will be viewed.

Seriously though, the white male gaze does not live here and I'm here for it. Code Switch brings me life every week and I wouldn't know what I would do without it. 

The podcast touches on so many issues and experiences and Gene and Shereen are unapologetically bringing the truth and critique.

2020-02-02 17:24:03,"I’m so confused on what this podcast is trying to achieve. In the episode “Ask Code Switch: What About Your Friends?” it begins by explaining that white people only befriend other whites and that POC are less likely to have friends at all, with a possible connection between the two. One of the hosts, Gene Demby, makes a remark that he didn’t have any white friends growing up as a response and defense against the belief they didn’t like him. The episode goes on to have a guest who explains “when minorities segregated themselves it is in defense, while when white people do it, it is because they’re racist.” Which absolutely validates the hosts adolescent antagonism towards whites. What in the world is this podcast trying to achieve by constantly labeling whites as the devil??? The contradiction is clear within a single episode.

My siblings and I went to our neighborhood school, while some friends’ parents either moved, or sought boundary exceptions to go to the mostly white schools in the suburbs. Everyone was welcome in our home. Decades into adulthood, I realized that it was a disservice to grow up not seeing color, because if I didn’t see color, I also could not see the reality of the history, nor the bias and discrimination so deeply embedded into EVERY facet of society. I could not see my privilege.  I could not see. Listening to this podcast (and several others) has altered my world view. I work in government. I am constantly challenging myself to toss aside ingrained behaviors and systems to look for ways to eliminate biases. The night President Obama was elected, my lack of understanding was on full display. I sobbed with tears of joy, believing that our country had finally turned a corner. My age, my whiteness, my upbringing, my education, my income, and my access to resources all support my complicity with systemic racism. Changing how you think changes how you feel, and changes the actions you take, and then the world around you changes. Listen to this podcast. Embrace change.",5,Every Single Episode,Weather Amateur

2019-07-17 08:14:59,"""Code Switch"" = endless harping about racism. Every. Single. Episode. Indictments galore for anyone not like them. It's tiresome and demoralizing. 

One host tries to outdo fellow Spanish-speaking guests with exaggerated pronunciations of Spanish words. The other has chronic mushmouth. Both are officious, judgemental, resentful, and whiny. 

Rarely does ""Code Switch"" introduce listeners to anything novel, e.g., the latest academic insights about demographic change, or the daily lives of families new to America (families that don't have severe grievances to air, that is). It's all negative, all the time. In contrast, ""Nancy"" from WNYC has a healthy balance of positive stories, e.g., celebrating aspects of certain cultures, and other stories highlighting some problems individuals from certain backgrounds face. 

It's basically as if the Yale students screaming at Professor Nicholas Christakis (check it out on YouTube) now have their own taxpayer-funded podcast. Negative. Alienating. Repellent.",1,Grievance Central,ray210

I am a fan of the genre but the analysis provided by the professor on the topic was mind-blowing and made me think, ""Of course! It all makes sense!"" Now her observations seem so obvious. There are also others like the one about the explanatory comma. I enjoyed that one and didn't really think much about it and was surprised to hear how much some people felt strongly against it. It's really helpful when this kind of information is shared because even though it can be somewhat jarring to hear about backlash to something you don't think is controversial AT ALL, it helps you understand where others are coming from though this is also in large part to a great production team.

Great job uncovering the day-to-day impact of racism in America, and helping listeners understand how and why endemic racism exists and how its unfairness manifests in our society. Still, I think the podcast could take more risks. 

They should push the show toward a more open dialogue by inviting people with differing opinions. To give an example, there was an episode arguing that pitbulls are demonized as a byproduct of racism, proven in part by stories in Sports Illustrated. This is presented as fact and goes unchallenged. Why not have a conversation with the writers/editors of those stories? Maybe there’s something more to understand?

There’s a lot to learn from this show but there should also be some willingness to challenge the narrative with counter opinions. It would make for a more compelling podcast.",1,Good but could be better,Saro11215

2018-12-12 17:10:10,"I’m so happy this show exists. Some of the episodes are really rewarding and shed light on perspectives that don’t get much airtime on traditional media outlets. I loved the stories about whiteness, the series following the school for black boys in DC, and the many segments about the immigrant experience. I don’t subscribe to the podcast anymore, however, because a few too many episodes were too upsetting. One that immediately comes to mind had a segment comparing sound advice regarding sharing expenses based on actual finances to a cynical take on restorative justice (in my opinion) where the white partner has to pay more as some sort of white tax. More upsetting, the episode on Civil War monuments presented a “he said/she said” narrative comparing an opinion based on the actual history of the Civil War to one steeped in the Lost Cause narrative — the latter being a widely discredited attempt at historical revisionism that occludes the true motivations of the war. Some of the statements the source said — that the Civil War was not about slavery but conflict between Northern English Americans versus Southern Scotch-Irish Americans — were just clearly untrue and I don’t understand how the producers didn’t catch that.

All that being said, I’m really happy Gene and Shereen are able to do this show and I still download episodes from time to time. Definitely worth giving a shot if you haven’t already checked it out.",3,A POC perspective on race in America,thundershower

I don't know where Gene picked this up at, but he pauses at odd moments within sentences, and then speeds up the rest of the words and says them reallyreallyreally fast ALLATONCE. Is this a ""broadcast voice"" thing? Is it a thing he does to sound more knowledgable? Younger? Cooler? Aaah, please stop!

That’s all fine and good, I don’t really care about using white people as your punching bag, whatever - as long as it’s entertaining and informative, I’m into it.  But if a dog breed (sorry, dog “shape”) routinely kills and eats it’s owners - like Bethany Lynn, look it up - that seems like something you should mention in a discussion about pit bull stigma, no?

Also, if your dog doesn’t like black people, I’m going to throw out an alternative explanation - maybe it had some bad experiences with black people?  For some reason, this hypothesis was never even floated.  Wonder why...",3,"Okay, but factually biased",8ude

2018-01-24 21:22:44,"Codeswitch team,

I’m not sure I would never claim to be woke as a state of being but after listening to the “R-word in the age of Trump” episode I’m a little less sleepy now. Hearing racism discussed in terms of harm versus character, defining where terms like bigotry and stereotype exist in relation to each other, and how racial language creates tough questions in this age of journalism was really...intense? Powerful? I can’t find the right word to encompass the fact that I kept rewinding this episode over and over to hear it again. I feel better equipped to understand, discuss, and identify racism and racial animus than I was yesterday in a way that fundamentally changes the conversation for me. I admit that it had never occurred to me that using racism as a descriptor of a perpetrators character without discussing the context of harm was itself racist. I am truly happy to have been exposed to this and the codeswitch team has a listener fr life after today. Thank you for the work that you do here.
