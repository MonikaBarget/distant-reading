2020-07-20 00:00:24	Some of the greatest sins in history have been at root people treating others as members of groups rather than individuals. This podcast I believe misses this important reality	1	Flawed thinking	from where you'd rather be

2022-08-03 12:56:27	“Be easy y’all… hydrate!” I am stoked that B.A. Parker will be co-hosting. Their  commentary is some of the best in podcasting. The Codeswitch hosting (and content) has always been spot on, and the team is definitely going from strength to strength.	5	B. A. Parker!	Kit Storey

2021-03-22 16:09:07	I have learned so much from listening to Code Switch. I love the dynamic between the hosts and the whole team has so much to contribute. I live in Canada but our struggles with race and equity are not far off. It’s hard to hear a lot of the realities that this podcast shines light on but it is so necessary to understand why our current situation isn’t working.	5	So necessary!	coffee climbing and cats

2020-07-08 10:06:06	This podcast was recommended to me several years ago and it has been an excellent source of learning/unlearning. Although an American show, the issues investigated and reported on are ones which are also present systemic in Canada. By broadcasting their own work as well as the work of others, the team covers a broad range while imparting in-depth knowledge.	5	Listen and learn	pcturn21
2021-01-18 16:35:35	"I’ve been listening to Code Switch for years. I’ve listened to almost every episode! It has given me so much food for thought and has helped me be more anti-racist in my daily life. I love the whole team—when I listen to their voices, I feel like they’re my friends.

I’m giving Code Switch four stars (instead of five) simply because the podcast is US-centric in its perspective. It doesn’t address the legacy of European colonialism around the globe. 

I’m a Canadian woman of Tamil and Sinhalese origin (my parents are immigrants from Sri Lanka). I feel that the economic and psychological legacy of European colonialism is a burden that affects people of colour around the world. If the Code Switch team could include some episodes with more of a global perspective, the podcast would be even better!"	4	An excellent podcast that could be even better	Michelle_Daniel

2020-06-02 16:15:02	The most recent episode of the podcast was a difficult, but absolutely necessary listen. I cannot imagine the strength it took to work through and produce it.	5	Gene, you’re incredible	_alisega501

2020-05-18 13:42:51	"Code Switch is my favourite podcast! I’m a transracial adoptee from Canada and an academic, and Code Switch has been a home for me, a place where I can hear and think about issues that feel relevant and urgent to me. 

I love the diversity of topics being brought up: the show tackles events that just happened on the news; it traces the history of a term or an issue; it covers the stories of BIPOCs of all stripes; it even recommends cool books! 

I’m also a fan of the ever nuanced, empathetic, and informed approach which this podcast takes. It isn’t afraid to leave space for ambiguity, grey areas, to show how complex issues are, and to let the listeners make up their own mind. 

The hosts, Shereen and Gene, are charming, smart, and easy to relate to, and I always feel like they ask the right questions. The issues are clearly well-researched and the guests, carefully picked. I’ve learnt a tremendous amount by listening to this podcast. 

Above all, Code Switch is a show with such a big heart. I can’t tell the number of times I teared up in the middle of the street because of something beautiful and hopeful that was said on the show. The episode on transracial adoptees hit me in the feels so hard, and it made me understand myself better. Thanks Code Switch!"	5	Thought-provoking, nuanced podcast about race	effet-catharsis

2018-07-15 11:00:56	"Most eps are about how non-whites (mostly blacks) are supposedly misunderstood and oppressed for not conforming to ""dominant culture"" (i.e. whitey), and how whitey should be ashamed of himself for not massively increasing spending by billions on free stuff for ""racialized"" groups. They don't invite any normal, rational people onto the podcast to debate their insane leftist identity politics - Code Switch is all about making its listeners more ""woke"". For example, they complain that the stories about the ""word gap"" (how poor black kids start school having heard several MILLION fewer words spoken to them) are guilty of ""deficit thinking"" and unfairly using whites as the norm to compare blacks against. It gets two stars for being fun to laugh at, but this is a bad podcast and they should feel bad for making it."	2	deluded identity politics echo chamber	Tartrazine

2018-04-24 13:44:53	Code Switch was my first real foray into the realm of podcasts about current events, and I'm so glad I started here. Right from the first episode I was hooked - the conversations that are being had by the team on Code Switch immediately made me uncomfortable, but in a productive way. I started to examine my own inherent biases, to explore how I can be a better ally and to confront what my privilege means. Being Canadian, it also gives me an opportunity to explore a lot of the issues facing our neighbours to the south - so I really appreciate a lot of the historic context and explanatory commas sprinkled into each episode. Gene and Shereen have great on-mic chemistry and the entire crew is always great to listen to when they're producing a segment of the show. I recommend this podcast to everyone I know!	5	Uncomfortable but necessary self reflections	JJofHammertown

2018-02-19 07:15:12	"The hosts obviously enjoy each other’s chemistry, but that doesn’t translate into an enjoyable podcast. I did enjoy earlier episodes which felt like there was sufficient effort and planning put into prep for each show. Right now it sounds like people are rolling out of bed and getting on the mic, which doesn’t make for great or even good shows. 

We are spoiled with the quantity of quality content right now, and NPR and Gimlet media have so many great podcasts. For now, I advise you search for those and leave the Code Switch off."	1	Flipping off the code switch	rikidikitavi
2018-01-27 20:51:57	An interesting and great podcast. Topics are always covered thoroughly and presented well. Not only do I relate to many of the things that are discussed, but I also get to learn about the experiences and issues that other POC face.	5	A podcast that we need	Kwanzinator

2017-09-28 11:26:31	Code Switch is an incredibly when done podcast. The hosts, Gene and Shereen, go in-depth on topics about race, politics, and culture. The best podcast discussing these topics in the podcast world. I'm a Canadian, but I can definitely identify with what they discuss and I'm also always learning new things without experiencing burn out (something I commonly face as a woc). They're funny, everything is always well researched, and I'm always excited to hear what they have to talk about.	5	The most superb podcast	Kourtneyal

2017-08-26 22:40:00	Code Switch's Gene, Shereen and the rest of the team do a fantastic job of bringing up issues of race in ways that are accessible and don't focus on only one group of people. Y'all are doing a great job and thank you so much for this podcast.	5	So needed	prakris

2017-01-27 02:46:46	For the team who puts your shows together- thank you, your podcast is a bright light in a confusing and potentially dark time.

2017-01-21 11:51:43	I started listening to Code Switch after being a long-time listener of Pop Culture Happy Hour, where I always loved Gene Demby and Kat Chow's apperances, and wow, it's a great show: it always manages to have really honest, nuanced, smart conversations about race and identity, with a great range of topics.	5	Really great!	Quise R.
2016-08-30 17:08:39	I had heard about Code Switch on the Pop Culture Happy Hour (Gene Demby is an occasional co-host) but hadn't ever listened to it until the Nate Parker episode.

2023-10-25 12:14:33	I have many podcasts that I follow and loved many of them, but this is the first time I feel the need to rate a podcast because of how much it fills a void. Also I love the chemistry flow between the 2 hosts, their preparation, and the different perspectives they bring. I don’t always agree with what the experts say, but it doesn’t matter. The topics fill me like gonzo finding his brethren. I’m mixed-race, and multi-cultural. Special shout-out to the episode with Ada Limón on 10/24/23.

2023-09-27 14:20:16	This one hit me hard. Being a Black Hispanic American who retired as a US Army Infantry Officer, your guess was absolutely on point about the environment, access to the education, perception, and still small demographics for Black Combat Arms Officers.  I was fortunate to have gone the internal route to becoming an Officer as a “Mustang” but definitely didn't make it any easier and potentially made it harder because most of my peers and superiors knew my background.

2023-09-21 18:58:37	This is pretty easy and has nothing to do with the conspiracy theories favored by the hosts.  For starters the Biden administration argued for a special exception to be made.  And Roberts in his opinion said that it’s as reasonable to exclude the military academies as they were not a party to the case.  In other words, if someone brings suit then there will be a better time and place to adjudicate the issue.  And then there is just the basic issue that the military argument bears no resemblance to college campuses. Given the controversies and violence on college campuses today that difference may lessening.  But even with that you have non state actors driving the violence.  With respect to Harvard and UNC you had the state actors as the driver of the racism.  And no mention of the simple fact that Harvard was caught dead to rights discriminating against Asians.  Guess Asians don’t count.	1	The rest of the story	muni guy
2023-07-11 23:02:10	The “Honoring our Ancestors” episodes are so conversational, honest, and graceful. I felt that while learning from your story, I was also being formed by how you told it. Thank you. May you feel the embrace of the Ancestors…Well done.	5	Powerful!	Frizzle Momma
2023-08-08 05:32:53	This used to be one of my favorite podcasts. It had a really wide range of topics and there was a clear effort to include much more representation. Since Shereen left, it quickly devolved into a series of vapid stories that are poorly written, and the representation that was so refreshing has nearly disappeared.	1	I miss Shereen	ChakMe'ex

2023-07-24 15:16:47	Two less educated people I have not heard. Their take on world politics, and current events is tantamount to that of a fifth grader writing a report for his elementary school teacher..	1	Pure propaganda	djmason9
2023-07-24 13:44:05	There’s a reason people flee Africa to come to this country in record numbers. They seem to be unaware of how racist it is here given how well they do in their new home. However, for White progressives that listen to this nonsense my advice is to keep listening! There is always more work that needs to be done!	1	Racism has never been lower	NonPartisan_Reviews
2023-07-24 13:38:27	This may be the dumbest podcast I almost got through. At least get someone on this that you can understand. 🤪	1	Powerfully bad. 🤦‍♂️	noarminian
2023-07-24 01:15:55	NPR puts out this junk now? With these kids on mic who don’t even know how to talk or if they do they uptalk and vocal fry? Really? And the grammar - seriously?  It’s not worth 2 mins more of my life.  These kids need to find another profession flipping burgers and probably will be forced to.	1	What amateur reporters	Dogluvr72

2023-07-09 05:36:10	The day I stopped listening was during an episode on Black representation in film. They were discussing horror and how we always die first (so they were saying). Someone brings up Alien and says the “Black guy dies first in Alien.” Or something to that extent. The Black guy’s name by the way is Parker. He’s played by the awesome Yaphet Kotto, an outstanding actor and character in a strong ensemble cast. Spoiler alert: he doesn’t die first. Considering it’s Yaphet Kotto, you could just get this right. Revisiting this masterpiece, I had to leave a review. Alien and its place in film is far and away more important and more significant than this stupid podcast. I don’t think I’ve listened to an episode since.	2	I Remember When I Stopped Listening	doczhivago
2023-05-31 11:23:13	Have listened from the beginning…what made the show so great was Gene and Shireen’s camaraderie, openness, and their ability to play off of each other’s strengths in knowledge, experience, and journalism. This remained true with other members of the Code Switch massive—Karen, Kumari, et al, but something isn’t clicking anymore. Really like what Parker and Lizaragga bring individually, but it’s been difficult to understand how they had to the crew. So many solo episodes now, and the ones where they are with Gene or another co-host, repartee is stilted and the stories feel fragmented. Rooting for the team, but will take a break for now, hopefully to check-in again to see a major improvement.	3	Waiting for its groove to come back	Oahhhhhhhhhhh
2023-06-24 17:16:52	"Listened to one ep which was enough. The hosts were discussing an issue and positively tried seeing it from a LatinX, Black, and Indigenous people perspective. But as soon as they said “well what about Asians?” they immediately said no and implied that now essentially ‘it’s going too far and becoming ridiculous’ - when they literally were discussing the same issue with through the lens of other BIPOC! 

I don’t know why or how this show continues to exist. I had such high hopes for it."	1	Anti Asian	iheartmusic88

2023-04-12 06:44:33	Great episode but in Florida they (Hispanics) are still sleep. Hispanics ain’t woke as it pertains to the realities of how they are perceived by Republicans, and as it pertains to the positive impact they can have if they just WAKE UP and get involved. Wow! Once again you guys hit it out the park. I grew up in NOLA and lived that color thing on a daily basis. As it is even today 50 years later I find it amazing how Whites attempt to muddy the water by any means necessary to retain power. The “Browning” of America is a very scary thing to some White people. In a country that has such a strong history of people of color from its indigenous roots, to enslavement to migration it seems as though White people will go to any length to lessen the power, discredit and discriminate against people of color. What will they think of next? SMH.	5	Wake up Brown people	PurpkeKnight

2023-03-29 08:27:03	This is by far your most relatable story as a Nigerian immigrant in America. We don’t call it that but it’s generally expected that you chip in to help your family. My dad had dozens of children and by the time I came around he had retired and had no money to raise me. My oldest sister paid for my school fees. When I graduated and started working I had to pay my youngest brother’s way through school.	5	Utang Na Loob is relatable to this African immigrant!!!	Bart Ranger
2023-03-29 05:47:48	I learn so much listening to this wonderful podcast. It’s a must listen.	5	Love the switch	Mama Z kids
2023-03-26 12:54:58	I really miss the original hosts. It’s just not the same anymore.	5	Missing	leciajb
2023-03-28 10:37:58	If you look at everything through the lens of race and racism, you will find racism everywhere. Another reviewer described this as “a dark cloud of a podcast”. That’s pretty accurate. It’s really a shame, I remember when NPR was quality. Now we get propaganda like this. If you like Kendi and DiAngelo, you will love this, but really you should read John Mcwhorter first.	1	Woke propaganda for the far left	DrWeirdMan
2023-02-23 16:13:13	I truly appreciate the show. I love how much I’ve learned over the course of almost three years and the intentionality the host place on subject matters the show tackles. The intersectionality of culture, race, and socio-economics is the true gem of this show. But here is the but. Over the course of subjects tackled, on several occasions, the host present themselves as typical millennials. They pretend as if presented with the same situation, they somehow would have risen above the calamities as a change agent. And frankly, and this is of course an assumption, I don’t think they would have changed the outcome of some of the more dire topics. It’s easy to say what you would have done over a mic and several years later. My suggestion, stop pretending and be the good journalist you’ve shown yourself to be. Sorry, I don’t normally have such a visceral response, but BA Parker on the Black History’s Family Tree just brought me to this review.	5	Great show, but . . .	Al Dominguez III
2023-03-18 19:17:11	"The show would benefit from more guests to share their perspectives because the hosts have a confusing, narrow, and sometimes contradictory point of view.

Also Gene people email you bc you are a podcast host."	2	Personal opinions; should be broadened	cestmoichien
2023-01-12 18:17:31	"I am a Peruvian-American and was raised with the big salsa greats like Fania, El Gran Combo and later when Carlos Vives was on the scene I really took a deeper look into cumbia from South America. It honestly wasn’t my favorite because I loved te
He faster rhythm of salsa and merengue but I learned to appreciate cumbia through the humble lyrics cumbia has. Thank you for this informative history lesson!"	5	Love the episode on the origins of cumbia!	Veronikaloves15
2023-02-15 21:26:45	"I grew up in PR and I have to say that this episode was basically a smear campaign for Puerto Ricans. I had Dominican friends and partners that lived on the island and they were basically treated like any other Puerto Rican. And is it really appropriation if they came to the Island and BROUGHT us their music and our musicians needed to compete to survive? (That was really just market competition) Also, how can you “appropriate” a culture that is so similar to yours?  Where you eat the same food and speak the same language?  This is like saying someone in Ghana is appropriating from Nigeria, although they BOTH are African peoples. 

We don’t have Black vs. white racism like America so stop trying to attribute your Mainland American social ills onto our Island. Does colorism exist? Yes. In every country you can imagine…But we Puerto Rican’s do not appropriate and are NOT racist like the whites of the US.

2022-11-02 19:43:00	Sure, they cover very hard topics. But almost always help to point a way forward. I have learned so much, and am grateful to these amazing storytellers	5	Heartening and educational	El Hemp
2022-11-05 14:36:26	The concept of this podcast is great and sometimes it sheds light on racial issues that are typically overlooked. Sadly, I find most of the episodes stretching to find some logical thread between a completely innocent social interaction and race. For example, there is an episode that explores the possibility of racist dogs? Another episode covers a South American migrant and largely focuses on the discomfort she feels when she’s asked where she is from (understandable) but it was wildly dramatic and neglected to even entertain the possibility such question could be asked innocently. Mostly, I am bothered that this podcast has found its way onto NPR’s Weekend Edition (WBUR & WGBH). It fills the time slot once held by “Car Talk” (which was hilarious) and now this dark cloud of a podcast emerges from the airwaves every weekend.	2	Great concept but often searching for logic	Fupaflap

2022-09-04 22:11:30	Episode 366: as a POC who’s originally from SC, the SC state flag since 1861 did not have the stars and bars and was not one of the last states to lose that in their state flag. SC used to fly the confederate flag above the state house well into the early 2000s. Sorry to be so pedantic but it’s an error you all rarely make and I hate to hear historic inaccuracies when we’re talking about serious topics like racism.	4	Love you all but you got a fact wrong…	Leiterdk
2022-08-17 18:14:26	Love this podcast that always gets me thinking but also keeps it real. The episode about what is funny about race made me laugh out loud on a subject that I spend a lot of time worrying and thinking seriously about. Thank you so much for this episode.	5	Race is funny?

2022-07-27 18:42:58	This show is excellent! It’s has become one of my favorite shows for listening to informative and powerful discussions.

2022-07-31 16:55:14	I feel like in an effort to highlight other facets of culture in America, we end up unconsciously treating ourselves like “others” in the same way that mainstream society does. By this I mean that it is damaging to discuss code switching without highlighting why it exists in the first place and the damage that is caused across the board because of it. By acknowledging the standards of expectations for conduct for most, which is rarely placed upon those in power, it validates the practices in a toxic relationship that I no longer wish to participate. They code switch too. Every time someone accidentally says the racist part out loud, we’re reminded of their true feelings of the global majority of humanity. Let that sink in.	2	Lacking	QueenBB.
2022-07-26 22:26:09	"Thank you for this podcast. This is content they definitely didn’t talk about when I was in school (millennial, here). I wish they did. 

I see a small population of 1 star reviews, but don’t let their reviews deter you. The content is intellectually-stimulating, entertaining, social - justice oriented from the lens of journalists in a field which is saturated with pre-dominantly white reporters. Thank you. You make us non-white folks feel heard. 

I hope you do more episodes on those invisible groups that fall under ethnic  blanket terms, but may deal with more nuanced issues socially and systemically in the U.S. (i.e. Bhutanese, Ethiopians, Hmong, Native Hawaiians, Indigenous peoples by Nation, Samoans, Venezuelans, etc).

2022-06-25 15:29:34	This is one of the best episodes I have listened to that addressed pragmatic problems and solutions with safety in schools and beyond. The model that explained how to offer programs to assist folks to get training, jobs, and financial support to get on their feet is right on target. How does society expect people to get a grip on life by just allowing them to flounder when reach majority or are released from incarceration?  Everyone doesn’t have the luxury of the “pulling up by your bootstraps” philosophy. More like this is welcomed. Your guest was exceptionally good at explaining and providing solutions.	5	The Rethinking Safety Episode	Chicago Grandma Pat

2022-03-29 03:24:15	I stumbled upon this podcast mainly because of the artwork, but stayed because of the topics. The discussions talk about all the things I want to know about but didn’t know who to ask.

2021-11-27 17:58:31	I listened to the census episode and I’m quite disappointed with the lack of research and data behind the discussion. It appeared to be driven by personal opinions and ‘hunch’ rather than detailed research. At one point the host said that he spoke to two people about how ancestry data helped them. That’s not a big group to provide any kind of conclusion or concrete examples of how ancestry cost is impacting census data. NPR, you can do better.	2	Disappointed with the research.	46565dde

2021-11-17 18:06:37	If you have genuine questions about race and ethnicity and justice, you won’t find answers here.  The hosts are biased propagandists enforcing a media-narrative Woke POV only. Taboos are strictly enforced, nothing about black on black violence nor how vitamin D deficiency disproportionately affects POC, eg.   They are clearly trying to gain political power and sympathy (etc) by finding social injustice everywhere they look rather than helping alleviate problems from within their chosen groups.	1	Enforces very narrow point of view	The Shadow Nose

2021-10-14 14:51:18	Thanks for finally doing an episode that centers Native peoples. I’ve loved this show for a long time but have always been shocked by how little Native American activism, issues, and literature are discussed. There are so many things that intersect with core Code Switch topics that could be covered and big things happening in the world of social justice and environmental racism on NDN lands and beyond.

2021-08-28 11:16:33	I always enjoy Code Switch book episodes and the conversation with Ashley C. Ford about her memoir was exceptional (i paused it after a few minutes to get the book and read it).

2021-08-05 13:18:18	I’m a long-time listener. This podcast isn’t for you if you aren’t open minded. You will probably hear things you disagree with or injustices that make you angry. The reality is we live in a racist society and this podcast aims to educate about race. It does that in spades. I am white and live in a state lacking in diversity. This podcast is well worth adding to your rotation. It might make you see things differently.	5	Excellent	Reesie, the Archivist
2021-07-26 06:59:46	"Man. Where to begin. First of all, these two have amazing voices. I just love listening to these two hosts as a pure auditory experience. Then, the range of topics they cover on race and it’s interconnection to every day life on both the macro and micro scale is incredible. 

I love tuning in each week to see what topic they’re covering next. This show is interesting, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes maddening, and always honest. Add Code Switch to your library and give it a listen to, you won’t be disappointed."	5	Great, Fearless, Thoughtful Podcast	Wk2009@me
2021-08-04 14:57:21	I used to love this podcast, but they just released an episode that’s behind a paywall. I understand public radio needs funding, but this is a horrible way to do it.	1	I usually love this podcast, but now there’s a paywall	shfkcjrirhdkdkel

2021-07-20 06:32:01	Such a great podcast about the subtleties and non-subtleties of race in America and the need to stop brushing these issues under the rug. This should be required listening for anyone who truly wants to educate themselves about the very real and persistent issues this country still has with race. It’s heartening to know these types of nuanced, sophisticated conversations exist.	5	For Sophisticated Listeners	DecemberKid
2021-07-17 15:27:31	Code Switch is one of my top five podcasts. The recent episode examining the complexity of Latinx identity at the intersection of race displays why this podcast is so important to our national dialogue about race and American identity. The hosts always dig deep and demonstrate care, courage and humor in confronting hard questions about race in America. Moreover, they examine issues related to race from multiple POC and geographic perspectives; they never rely on reductive black/white binary narratives. As a Latina, I soooo appreciate being seen and learning about diverse Latinx experiences AND the experiences of Indigenous, Black, Asian, and multiracial folks in the U.S. and PR. This podcast is a great resource for educators.	5	Excellent & Nuanced	BX Educator

2021-06-29 02:11:34	"I wanted to like this podcast, gave the hosts SO many chances.  But this is just the most biased, narrow-minded, racist garbage I've ever heard. I don't like to throw around the word ""WOKE"" as a pejorative, but this podcast deserves it.  Black people insisting that everything around them is racist. Hey, if you believe that the answer to everything is ""racism""... then maybe you're the racist."	1	Gross.  Just gross.	Skeptical Lib
2021-06-28 20:06:13	"Their un-holy land episode unfairly targeted a Palestinian immigrant. They left out huge context such as, he had done nothing wrong. He did not send out the bad social media posts. They offered no defense of why an entirely family and business (working class people!) should be destroyed by privileged college education keyboard warriors.

I suppose it makes me feel slightly less embarrassed as a middle aged white man that these painful illuminations where obscured from plenty of non-‘white’ folks too. Dang. 

Still, I much appreciate yet another unique perspective on this story. I hope the local Tulsan residents were listening and that it creates positive dialogue there. Someone needs to give that original resident a parade of her own, and a fat kiss!"	5	Expansion team	kunlaou

I like the reporting and banter between Sheridan and Gene. However, would like to request that Gene try to speak a bit more slowly and clearly enunciate his words.

2021-04-20 16:17:52	Code Switch is such an amazing podcast. I love how they break down and contextualize history in a way that helps me better understand the present. I’ve learned how to see patterns within American history more readily and it has got me thinking even more deeply about race than before. As an south Asian American woman it has shown me the similarities among other minority groups as well as the ways in which I have privilege. I especially enjoyed a recent episode about the Hawaiian language and resonated with it as a bilingual speaker.

It seems to me the violence is increasing and bolder. We are split as a country. We must start to demand correct honest history be taught. If not In schools than in home or to our kids friends.

2021-03-28 17:10:54	I wanted to like this episode and I am always looking for new podcasts. I wasn’t aware of the rise in Asian hate crimes, which is appalling. I was disappointed though, because the hosts completely disregarded the topics of prostitution, the sex trade and sex addiction, & pornography in our society and how detrimental these things can be for women and girls of all races, and which may have been factors in the horrible shooting. No one ever wants to address those things, it seems like.	2	Intellectually dishonest	leeleemaymae

2021-03-15 21:51:09	This episode really hit home and moved me to tears. My parents were immigrants to the US  from India and didn’t emphasize me learning their native language. Now as a mom I struggle to pass it down to my kids. After this past year with white supremacy on the rise, I know no matter how American I sound, I will never be accepted as fully American. So I started to teach my kids and now have developed learning aids to help other parents who struggle to immerse their kids. @BhashaKids is going to teach that next generation.	5	Saving a Language You’re Learning	AnitaKSS

For a time I came to you guys to hear about important current racial issues, and now that things have heated up I just feel like you are avoiding the real uncomfortable hot topic to avoid possible hostility. I understand self preservation and all it’s just that I really felt you guys were brave enough not to back down or try to avoid bullet. Now I’m noticing you just trying to fly under the radar 😔. Love the show though hopefully you will have juicy stories (Reperation, BLM, Racial bias training, common core math, Asian American struggle, religion, how all people are feeling about all the external changes occurring) again one the dust settles.	3	I honestly wish I could put 5 stars	QH242

2021-02-21 16:11:52	"I’m a white 23 year old, and I’ve lived in a city of all white people for my entire life. Until I went to college, I realized how amazing it is to have such a diverse group of people and to learn about different cultures. I’m not ashamed of who I am as a person, but I feel a person can be more interesting the more they know about the world and other people including, cultural views! So I decided to make myself more interesting out of pure love for all people. 

Recently, I’ve been struggling with the right thing to say when my acquaintances say “BLM is a joke”, “black people aren’t oppressed”, “they’re making the division worse”, “to end racism let’s not talk about it”. Now, it boils my blood, but I never know exactly what to say because whatever I do say, I want it to spark something in that person. Like immediate change! I’ve realized it’s not so easy. Listening to these podcasts have been amazing because it provides me with situations similar to ones I have been in. It provides me with the ability to just listen and develop an understanding. There are a few ideas that I have not yet come to full understanding with, but that’s ok! Even if I disagree (not saying a disagree with any points made on here) with any point on any podcast, it’s not worth taking back a star unless those hosts do not back their statements up. 

Five stars here because it’s educational, well said, factual, and a trusted piece of art that I can truly listen to. I wish I could make a change by snapping my fingers!!!!! Thank you for such an amazing podcast that gets me up and moving every morning :)"	5	I wanted insight	Summmmmmmmmmmmmmmeerr

2021-02-03 11:25:17	The episode was provocative and I think the judicial logic of the Professor’s theory for providing reparations to some compelling but at what cost?

Atrocious acts took place. Murders. Millions in damage. Businesses closed forever. Flip the script and the government gets a taste of no protection. Immediately the entire national guard is called in to protect the government who ignored and refused to protect our communities.

I am incredibly grateful to avoid so many disadvantages by being white.  But I certainly don’t avoid meanness.  Everyone is mean.  I don’t think anyone sees that as much as white girls.  People being mean has nothing to do with racism.”  
Gene wrote back one sentence: “Why are you emailing me?”

2021-01-21 19:52:48	I have followed Ms. Rascoe since her first day reporting with NPR. And I knew she was assigned to cover The White House and that she followed the tweets and briefings coming from there. Good for her for calling out the lead-up language to the attacks of 1-6-2021. Thank you, Ms. Rascoe, for your analysis of the bullying tweets and for enduring the ugliness of the former regime. Thank you, Code Switch, for sharing this analysis with us. I am not certain we would have connected the lead-up language with the insurrectionist actions as quickly. Yes, that connection has been a slow one for the media. Great observation.	5	The Last Four Years	emma hopewell
2021-01-20 16:16:11	I just wanted to thank you for the episode about how race is discussed, or rather, how it is not, in France. As an Asian-American who has lived here for over 10 years, I felt relieved that FINALLY someone was talking about the inherent racism hiding in the French language. The guests on your show gave me hope that some of the good discussions and movements  that are going on now via BLM will find impetus here, to affect true change in French society.	5	‘We don’t say that’	c-lion in Paris

Until I heard the latest about black gun owners and I was totally disappointed and disgusted about their professionalism. Totally seems like they tricked that man into thinking they thought what he was doing was interesting just to speak on the episode and basically not only say he’s wrong but stupid. If they tried for one second to be a little unbiased, you wouldn’t even know... I don’t know why anyone would let them interview them after that.	1	Wanted to love it, ended up hating it....

2021-01-02 16:25:44	Imagine a world where the group you identify with endlessly accuses others of bigotry, never offering solutions or ideas that aren’t being tried already (namely welfare programs and critical race theory, etc.). Imagine America becoming more of a melting pot than ever, and people of color being elevated in every way possible, yet, economically and communally the country is dying. Imagine being so oppressed that your podcast is deemed podcast of the year by a company like Apple, and your media praised and pushed by every major Corporation.

2020-12-31 03:44:19	"“There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs — partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.”

2020-12-08 14:30:11	I enjoy listening to this show. I often learn a lot and find my perspective shifted. I also find the discussions non-heated, non-accusatory and calm - which is missing from discussions of topics today that stir a lot of emotion in people - which ALLOWS for the points made and the discussion to be really absorbed.	5	Great, Insightful Show	Alden8394

I could add NR Non Racist but appears that I have been disenfranchised from that because stupid white people just don’t know they are racist.
I listen to get other perspectives which I am finding very uncomfortable. Maybe good but if one sided diminishes the point. 
My side on who pays for what based on race or background is that is ridiculous. Just have some self respect and pay for yourself whenever possible no matter what color or race you are. Gifts are meaningful to the giver and taker only when they are given freely without asking."	5	NBWAASSNR	michkatel

2020-12-01 21:46:22	This is a podcast that makes you think about certain issues, but it deals superficially with other issues. Shereen needs to learn how to use Latinx. It’s a term mostly used by Americans to lazy to actually think about the gender they are talking about, but it doesn’t apply to everything. Countries, for example, don’t have a gender, so saying Latinx country is wrong and sounds ridiculous. The same can be said about Latinx music or culture. Drop the X or say Latin-American countries o music when talking about things and not people. It is really distracting. For most Hispanics this is not even an issue, like not all Blacks care only about criminal justice issues, but something they move away from, which explains Trump’s improvement among Blacks and Hispanics.	3	Interesting yet not surprising	A reviewer from Socorro, NM

2020-11-27 13:56:01	I knew, as a white cisgendered woman, that I needed to find more diverse perspectives to listen to- at the time, my feed was mostly white and mostly science or comedy podcasts.  I went through the back catalogue of Code Switch and was pleased to get a good mix of politics, race relations, social commentary, etc.  I like that there is a mix- while I know I need the politics and race relations discussions and welcome them, it's also nice to have other episodes thrown in- ones that aren't necessarily about the current news cycle, but are more evergreen.  I especially like the episodes about racism in other countries- there seems to be this idea that American exceptionalism extends also to racism- that we are the only country that experiences it.  By showing that other countries also experience racism, we can see that it's not just an American issue, and it can highlight how odd, if you look from the outside, racism really is.	5	It's Great!	S. Ankenbauer
2020-11-25 10:31:57	I adore Code Switch... I love every single thing about it...it’s smart, funny, enlightening and educational as it’s opened my eyes to so many issues.  What struck me after listening to the Nov 25th Thanksgiving, where there was a re-play of a previous  ( 2016 post election) episode re “ talking with family about politics”.  There was a lightness and a sense of ( a bit of hope) in their conversation and their voices. I noted that their voice tone was higher, faster, with more giggles.  I now see what these past years of the Trump assault, the Trump wear and tear, the  Trump fascist ( insert adjective) can do to people. It wore us down, it tired out us, it changed us in tiny ( and large) ways. This is my humble opinion, I continue to be an ardent fan of the podcast and I pray for the healing of this nation.  Thank you Code Switch for all you do and done, your hard work inspires me.	3	What 4 years Can Do to Podcast Hosts!	Marshee10012
2020-11-25 19:01:18	A show that focuses only on how different, separate, isolated, segregated, divided, and hopelessly NOT united in the states as human beings we all are, based on mostly superficial and non-nuanced criteria. If you want to feel like humans of different colors have nothing in common, listen to this piece of negative propagandized garbage. My soul cannot bear to hear only about what divides us as Americans anymore. This is truly ignorance at work and a force only for negativity. Nuance is dead. Congratulations.	1	Soul Sucking	Birdy0001

I’ve started listening to other race podcasts and Gene and Shereen got it goin on!! Their podcast is well organized, super well researched, just enough host/hostess banter and awesome topics all the time.

2020-08-27 15:25:53	I found the Karen ep interesting bc it started to recognize nuance about how shire women are marginalized. Then it completely negated the fact that the term “Karen” could have sexist undertones—which it can, even while aptly describing racist women. I think the instant dismissal was unwarranted and then the long talk abt white women behind the scenes telling white men to do their bidding was once again, not nuanced. Their are all sorts of power in this world, and dismissing sexism claims (esp bc it came from the male host) was trivializing.	3	Lacking nuance at times	news_reader77

I know this is different from my own learned racism. The similarity is that I am often told my experience is not true, that I don’t know what’s best for my boys or their experience is not valid.

2020-08-20 19:41:03	"I listen to racial justice podcasts obsessively, read books by Black anti-racist educators, and follow voices of the Black community on social media. All I’m ever trying to do is educate myself, recognize my privilege, and fight to eradicate white supremacy. Though this podcast hits on the issues I care about, I just can’t stand the sheer amount of snark and nastiness in relation to substance anymore. And after weeks straight of starting an episode eagerly but stopping it before the end in annoyance, I’m finally unsubscribing and writing this review. 

I realize white people are bumbling, careless, racist fools whose needs cannot be centered in race discussions. At the same time, no one who needs to learn about the realities of racial oppression is going to get anything from hearing the hosts high five each other for thirty minutes as they see who can make the most snarky comment about how awful white people are. I just don’t get the point of that in a podcast that is essentially “Intro to Racism 101” for white liberal NPR listeners who are clueless on race. Is it intended to be funny? What?

It’s perfectly fine for there to be spaces for bipoc to let off steam about white people and the idiotic, harmful things we do. I am in full support of those spaces, and of keeping myself out of them because they’re not meant for me! But if this is a podcast that seeks to educate, to change people’s minds (especially white people’s), you gotta have more than what amounts to a couple of friends trying to out-eyeroll each other about the annoyances white people wreak on the world.

Case in point: the episode about interracial friendships. Did y’all think it was funny when you dropped your little snark line about white people who call the Black person they see at the water cooler their friend and use that as proof that they have a diverse friend group? Did you really need to include that “you know who you are” as if this caricature is widely represented? Did you think that approach would REALLY open the mind of the kind of person who does that and who most needs to change? Or were you just wanting to score points? It’s really just gross, to be frank.

Again, yes, white fragility is a serious problem and I’m not in favor of centering white emotions in talks about race. That’s not what this review is. I am hugely interested in looking at myself and my privilege critically, to deconstruct everything I know about the world so that I can try to see it without the lens of privilege. And I can say wholeheartedly that this podcast has done basically nothing to further that, even for me as a person who understands that this work is not at all easy, who embraces learning painful truths about myself. If I’m saying this, imagine how turned off the average “but I don’t see color!” white person—who we truly need to engage in media like this—is going to be when they listen.

The hosts and producers need to reconsider who this podcast is intended for. If it’s for a white audience learning about race and injustice, they need to change the tone. Sorry to tone police, but yeah. You need to work on making it less about the hosts throwing anecdotes at each other. Still call us out—we need it—but you can do it in a really effective manner if you try a little harder. If this podcast is for bipoc who need a place to laugh and cringe and rage about white people, then that’s totally cool, but please make that more explicit in the marketing for this show so you don’t scare off people who don’t know the harm of their white tears. If you want a great example of how to do the former, look at the way the hosts of Pod Save the People deliver hard realities. They don’t mince words or tiptoe around white emotions, but they pack so much substance and truth into every episode that it is always a worthwhile experience to listen. The complete opposite is true of Code Switch."	1	Does nothing for me but grate.	shadycarp

2020-08-16 17:53:08	I’ve been listening to code switch since it started and used to really enjoy it. Lately, I’ve struggled to connect with the episodes. They don’t feel well produced (with the exception of the holy land episode which was one of the best of 2020). I’m currently listening to the episode about Kamala Harris and it’s terrible. The hosts have this terrible banter and very surface level analysis. The hosts are just snarky and don’t add a lot of substance. They use sound bites from interviews and make boring comments. Anyway, I hope this podcast gets better again.	2	The hosts are not great	jennj_bee

I just finished the fight for ethnic studies at SFSU and was so amazed that growing up in the Bay Area (my dad attended SFSU not too many years later) I had never even heard about it. I was constantly brought up with the idea that racism only happened in the south. I always knew there was more to it than that and I really appreciate stories like this. Thanks!	5	Thanks for the show!	AliMVrbas

Although the history was important, I would have liked if the hosts had presented conversations and perspectives from current faculty members, administrators, and students within the California state university system agreeing and/or disagreeing with mandatory studies.

2020-08-05 01:10:07	"Some of my first listens were like, “this is great!”.  I may be wrong, but the overall sentiment does not address that racism, more over prejudice in my experience, is a two-way street…. A  four-way stop sign that is ingrained in all peoples, of all ethnicities.  People are raised, how they are raised by others; families, communities, schools, religions, and they either turn out good or they turn out  bad.  
Beyond the beauty and innocence of childhood, tolerance is taught, learned and practiced, just as prejudice is taught learned and practiced.
You cannot define me as ‘Gray People’, nor can you define me as ‘Green People’, for I am neither, yet if you saw me in person, you might feel that I am one, or the other.  I do not like that this show talks about ‘xyz People’ so often and sometimes in a callous disrespectful manner.  We are all just People.
I am fortunate enough to have been raised multi-multi culturally and I embrace many philosophies, many ethnicities, many religious beliefs and more importantly the fact that we are all humans of only two species.
It would be nice to hear a more diverse, inclusive conversation once in a while.  The subjects are intriguing and educational.  The show means well.  Don't stop.
So please try to do well.  Improve and expand the delivery."	3	Peoples	Cargo Bike David

2020-07-02 13:43:48	Excellent episode on understanding why documents in this country matter. From finding the truth of one’s identity to understanding the historical nature of systemic racism, classism, and the established stature of white supremacy-even though her white relative knew sleeping with his enslaved was not only taboo but to have birthed an heir that needed to be challenged in court produces a legitimacy to blackness in this country. Chained, delivered, and thus reconciled through the acknowledgement of law, African Americans (now, Black) have an indelible legacy unlike any in this world. We are America! We are the race where moral righteousness kindles perpetually. And to know, through the years, that we have forgiven the most vile of assaults on our bodies keeps me ever thankful for the journey that is us!!!	5	Tracing History	Shenard R.

2020-06-20 21:40:02	"Code Switch helps me understand people more.  I""m mildly autistic, so all people are largely a mystery to me.

The power structure (all white, back then, surprise, surprise) failed me from first grade onward.  White kids drove me to tears, over and over, and white teachers did nothing but blame me.  So I wanted nothing to do with them. To this day, all someone has to be for me to consider tham as my people is not be mean.

So I really hate bullies.  Racists are either bullies or bully enablers.  So I hate them, too.  Code Switch encourages me by going after ignorance and more particularly racism, with good information, good reporting, good interviews.  While I""m a very willing learner, I'm a slow learner, about social things, anyway, and Code Switch has helped me catch up. 

Please give them a listen.  Please listen for at least a month.  You may not think so, but if you listen that long, their criticism isn't  as much about you as you may think.  They'd probably be happy to meet you.  They're good, positive people.  They're not haters.

2020-06-18 12:51:19	"This is the podcast I’ve been searching for. 

From a white Kansas farmer who is striving to be better. It hasn’t been enough to just believe in the steady match of progress, to believe that the voices of a targeted group of people are enough for the country of liberty and justice for all to correct itself. 

When you’re surrounded by a culture that avoids the hard conversations and places the ones forcing them as antagonistic to the peace of the family. It was easy to feel like your influence for change is small, that your isolation makes speaking out like yelling at clouds.

Listening to this podcast brings the harder conversations I don’t have access to in my day to day. The reminder that we are far from done and that the anger fades. Though I am entering into a busy time of year, I lean on podcasts like these to keep me connected and motivated to keep looking for other voices to boost, other perspectives to read.

To date this review the question that was posed this episode was why now. To ask myself that in the midst of this was a challenge I needed to confront. To the hosts of the show thank you."	5	Listening to some of the harder conversations	ThElectricbanjo

2020-06-15 05:48:25	This show tackles race fearlessly and with great nuance. The episode from a while back on Respectability Politics might be the best episode of any podcast I’ve ever heard, and I’m compelled to write this review about halfway through the more recent episode regarding outside agitators because it so effectively communicates what I wanted to say but couldn’t put into words, while running through some fascinating facts, history, and personal accounts I otherwise wouldn’t be exposed to.

Thank you for making a podcast that addresses the difficult and necessary issues and having the conversations we need to be having with ourselves, families, neighbors, and communities. You both have done an amazing job breaking down issues and language of race and gender identity; giving white people like me a way to understand and empathize with oppressed minorities and what daily struggles they face.

I am white. I grew up in the Bay Area in  various mixed ethnic communities in the 80’s-90’s. Most of my adulthood was in Hawaii, while raising children. Minorities are white children (ha’ole). 
What is happening recently is making me and my children so disgusted. I don’t know what to tell my 13 year old son, who has fair skin and bright blue green eyes. How should he operate in this world?  He has only known ‘mixed’ communities. But that isn’t how he will be viewed. 
I am so sad that today seems to be less progressed than ‘yesterday’."	5	So sad	christina lurendez
2020-05-30 14:52:48	Love the show! Thanks so much for your info and insight. I’m a 65 year old African American woman. We as a people have suffered America’s oppression for hundreds of years. Friday night was the first time I finally saw white Americans come out and really support us. We lived thru so many years of them accepting the way we were treated. We had to just live with the situation and continue to try to still survive. All we’ve ever wanted is to be able live a good life.	5	Finally	almentra

2020-05-20 20:09:36	"It's so refreshing to listen to a podcast that is by and for people of color that know and understand what it is like to be a person of color in the US. The racial lens is on point and so refreshing. No need to listen to a white person pontificate about our experiences anymore! Seriously though, the white male gaze does not live here and I'm here for it. Code Switch brings me life every week and I wouldn't know what I would do without it. 

The podcast touches on so many issues and experiences and Gene and Shereen are unapologetically bringing the truth and critique. They understand why its important to stay woke and are the breath of fresh air we've all been waiting for. I'm sad I didn't discover the podcast until 2017, but have been catching up on all the episodes slowly. If you need to dive into issues that are intersectional and layered, this is a great place to start!

From our start, at least back to 1619, race and racism has been a part of the American experience. It shaped our institutions and our society. 

This podcast shines a light on what’s been in plain view. It helps me understand my privilege and to act as a better ally.  I find some episodes difficult but they rarely completely crush my soul. Usually, I learn of activists fighting to create a level playing field and that give me hope."	5	An important topic are delivered by a solid team	citizenKahn.peterKahn

2020-04-13 14:24:30	In the last episode you guys referred to the Japanese being put into concentration camps. The Jews were put into concentration camps as part of a systematic way to kill millions of them through starvation, torture and being gassed. The Japanese were put into interment camps. Awful, no doubt and a shameful part of American history. But they were not concentration camps.

2020-02-16 15:53:11	"Well done podcast, interesting guests. I like hearing listeners’ anecdotes. It’s refreshing to hear people grapple with difficult things. And to get a wide range of perspectives. 

What I really want to understand is why a significant number of European or white Americans are resistant to, or even antagonistic toward, the idea of discussing race and how it affects people’s experiences. That seems like a very specific thing culturally to the US, where there is a big opportunity to grow, learn and mature."	5	Rad	Ms_AJD
2020-02-11 01:55:17	I’m so glad to have found this podcast. I am a white women, living in a less than diverse community. These are tough conversations that, at times are painful and upsetting, but we all need to be open to hearing and learning from. I love the different voices and perspectives that are included and the raw honesty presented by the hosts.

2020-02-02 17:24:03	I’m so confused on what this podcast is trying to achieve. In the episode “Ask Code Switch: What About Your Friends?” it begins by explaining that white people only befriend other whites and that POC are less likely to have friends at all, with a possible connection between the two. One of the hosts, Gene Demby, makes a remark that he didn’t have any white friends growing up as a response and defense against the belief they didn’t like him. The episode goes on to have a guest who explains “when minorities segregated themselves it is in defense, while when white people do it, it is because they’re racist.” Which absolutely validates the hosts adolescent antagonism towards whites. What in the world is this podcast trying to achieve by constantly labeling whites as the devil??? The contradiction is clear within a single episode. Please promote love!!!!!	1	I’m so confused on what the goal is	regularguy84
2020-01-22 22:51:05	I am a white woman who married a man of color whose mom did everything she could to strip him of his cultural heritage so that he would be accepted. I love the open and non-aggressive/defensive conversations about race. Everyone of every race should listen to this podcast. We cannot bring people together without understanding each other. Too often (including with my husband’s family) deep conversations are deliberately avoided. Not in this podcast!	5	Much needed conversation!	CieloSera
2020-02-01 14:36:07	"All these race focused podcasts do is sow the seeds of racial resentment and divide the country.

95% of White people don’t wake up each day and think about the color of people’s skin — and no it’s because we’re privileged, it’s because we were taught skin color is irrelevant. In 58 years I’ve never met a White Supremacists because there aren’t enough White Supremacists in America to fill a medium sized stadium.

2019-10-23 17:06:24	Code Switch is all about reminding us of our past and present issue with race in the United States. Sometimes it’s to celebrate the customs and traditions of people of color, while other times it sheds light on the current injustice against POCs. If you want to be informed and enlightened on how people of color paint the landscape of this country, listen to Code Switch.	5	Keeping us accountable	Guy202

They are telling things like they are, and like they were, often directly from the mouths of those who have lived with and through racism and it’s often unimaginable consequences. They also offer possible solutions and, importantly, hope.	5	Telling it!	SusanCooks
2019-10-23 11:42:15	I just discovered this podcast and I am devouring it. I so appreciate the range of topics and the diverse perspectives. It is full of compassion, humor, history and poetry. Thank you for an amazing and informative show.	5	My new favorite podcast	😀😀😀Kitty
2019-10-23 04:43:53	I am a mid-50s, middle class white woman whose parents essentially “didn’t see color”.  My siblings and I went to our neighborhood school, while some friends’ parents either moved, or sought boundary exceptions to go to the mostly white schools in the suburbs. Everyone was welcome in our home. Decades into adulthood, I realized that it was a disservice to grow up not seeing color, because if I didn’t see color, I also could not see the reality of the history, nor the bias and discrimination so deeply embedded into EVERY facet of society. I could not see my privilege.  I could not see. Listening to this podcast (and several others) has altered my world view. I work in government. I am constantly challenging myself to toss aside ingrained behaviors and systems to look for ways to eliminate biases. The night President Obama was elected, my lack of understanding was on full display. I sobbed with tears of joy, believing that our country had finally turned a corner. My age, my whiteness, my upbringing, my education, my income, and my access to resources all support my complicity with systemic racism. Changing how you think changes how you feel, and changes the actions you take, and then the world around you changes. Listen to this podcast. Embrace change.	5	Every Single Episode	Weather Amateur

Code Switch should be required listening for all Americans, but White Americans in particular (of which I am one). Thank you."	5	Should be required listening	Annie Marges

As of May 14, still having Code Switch pop up instead of Fresh Air, anytime I refresh Fresh Air.

2019-07-16 00:41:50	White girl from Seattle who works in tech, here. This is one of my all-time favorite podcasts. I appreciate how diverse the topics are — they cover everything from the racial politics behind the US Census to being a queer person of color. And it’s refreshing to hear perspectives from folks who aren’t privileged white men. Thank you, Code Switch Team!	5	Good breadth of topics and voices	M1kania
2019-07-17 08:14:59	"""Code Switch"" = endless harping about racism. Every. Single. Episode. Indictments galore for anyone not like them. It's tiresome and demoralizing. 

One host tries to outdo fellow Spanish-speaking guests with exaggerated pronunciations of Spanish words. The other has chronic mushmouth. Both are officious, judgemental, resentful, and whiny. 

Rarely does ""Code Switch"" introduce listeners to anything novel, e.g., the latest academic insights about demographic change, or the daily lives of families new to America (families that don't have severe grievances to air, that is). It's all negative, all the time. In contrast, ""Nancy"" from WNYC has a healthy balance of positive stories, e.g., celebrating aspects of certain cultures, and other stories highlighting some problems individuals from certain backgrounds face. 

It's basically as if the Yale students screaming at Professor Nicholas Christakis (check it out on YouTube) now have their own taxpayer-funded podcast. Negative. Alienating. Repellent."	1	Grievance Central	ray210
2019-07-14 03:43:55	I love this show. I’m so grateful for these perspectives. This is important work for everyone to hear for different reasons. I assume people of color feel it’s important to have shared space to talk about shared experiences. It’s definitely important for white people to just shut up and listen and allow people of color to feel like the won’t be interrupted for a change.	5	Thank you	Mrs & Mrs Bickerson

Even now I am afraid of doing or saying something stupidly offensive. I totally agree that it’s my job to educate myself so I read a lot. But this podcast, hearing ideas, issues, explanations, history, and traditions in the voices of many people different than myself is exciting! I am so happy to finally make sense of things.

Hard to pick faves but I especially appreciated the one about black characters in horror movies. I am a fan of the genre but the analysis provided by the professor on the topic was mind-blowing and made me think, ""Of course! It all makes sense!"" Now her observations seem so obvious. There are also others like the one about the explanatory comma. I enjoyed that one and didn't really think much about it and was surprised to hear how much some people felt strongly against it. It's really helpful when this kind of information is shared because even though it can be somewhat jarring to hear about backlash to something you don't think is controversial AT ALL, it helps you understand where others are coming from though this is also in large part to a great production team. As for some constructive feedback, use fewer academics. As good as they often are, there are other experts out there."	5	Always Insightful	nadi624

Great job uncovering the day-to-day impact of racism in America, and helping listeners understand how and why endemic racism exists and how its unfairness manifests in our society. Still, I think the podcast could take more risks. 

They should push the show toward a more open dialogue by inviting people with differing opinions. To give an example, there was an episode arguing that pitbulls are demonized as a byproduct of racism, proven in part by stories in Sports Illustrated. This is presented as fact and goes unchallenged. Why not have a conversation with the writers/editors of those stories? Maybe there’s something more to understand?

There’s a lot to learn from this show but there should also be some willingness to challenge the narrative with counter opinions. It would make for a more compelling podcast."	1	Good but could be better	Saro11215

2018-12-28 16:11:21	I pull up Code Switch frequently, and I appreciate the many ways the hosts dissect race, intersectionality, and go deep in a variety of ways. I’ve been known to share this podcast with friends and colleagues, and I appreciate the courage to tackle the ways race is lived, felt, and discussed in America and beyond. Keep up the good work.	5	Always a good listen	Jacqueline531
2018-12-27 01:23:13	I admire how they illustrate the complex role that race plays in our everyday lives and hxstories. I also appreciate the diversity of topics that they talk about in relation to race and that they bring people/professionals to talk about such topics. Lastly, I love how much I can relate to the the curators of the podcast and the way they facilitate the podcast is funny, critical, and easy to follow. Overall, this podcast is critical, urgent, funny, and loving.	5	Critical and caring podcasr	AlejandroES

2018-12-19 14:38:09	One of my favorite discoveries of 2018! The lens through which they discuss issues is truly refreshing, especially for NPR (which is a well intended organization but like everything heavily dominated by white male perspectives). I don’t agree with all their tales and I LIKE that. Growth comes from both challenge and affirmation. Do yourself a favor and make this a weekly download.	5	Always thought provoking and at times entertaining and cathartic	MPAnon

2018-12-12 17:10:10	"I’m so happy this show exists. Some of the episodes are really rewarding and shed light on perspectives that don’t get much airtime on traditional media outlets. I loved the stories about whiteness, the series following the school for black boys in DC, and the many segments about the immigrant experience. I don’t subscribe to the podcast anymore, however, because a few too many episodes were too upsetting. One that immediately comes to mind had a segment comparing sound advice regarding sharing expenses based on actual finances to a cynical take on restorative justice (in my opinion) where the white partner has to pay more as some sort of white tax. More upsetting, the episode on Civil War monuments presented a “he said/she said” narrative comparing an opinion based on the actual history of the Civil War to one steeped in the Lost Cause narrative — the latter being a widely discredited attempt at historical revisionism that occludes the true motivations of the war. Some of the statements the source said — that the Civil War was not about slavery but conflict between Northern English Americans versus Southern Scotch-Irish Americans — were just clearly untrue and I don’t understand how the producers didn’t catch that.

All that being said, I’m really happy Gene and Shereen are able to do this show and I still download episodes from time to time. Definitely worth giving a shot if you haven’t already checked it out."	3	A POC perspective on race in America	thundershower
2018-11-30 19:22:01	"The cadence of Gene Denby's voice is EXTREMELY difficult to listen to. I'd love to know if this bothers other listeners as well. I don't know where Gene picked this up at, but he pauses at odd moments within sentences, and then speeds up the rest of the words and says them reallyreallyreally fast ALLATONCE. Is this a ""broadcast voice"" thing? Is it a thing he does to sound more knowledgable? Younger? Cooler? Aaah, please stop! I can't even handle it when he guest-hosts on other NPR podcasts (Pop Culture Happy Hour, for one)."	3	Gene's Cadence is the Worst	SDSSTL
2018-11-29 14:13:39	"Just listened to the episode about dogs.  Lots of pro-pit bull propaganda, couched in criticism of white people.  

That’s all fine and good, I don’t really care about using white people as your punching bag, whatever - as long as it’s entertaining and informative, I’m into it.  But if a dog breed (sorry, dog “shape”) routinely kills and eats it’s owners - like Bethany Lynn, look it up - that seems like something you should mention in a discussion about pit bull stigma, no?

Also, if your dog doesn’t like black people, I’m going to throw out an alternative explanation - maybe it had some bad experiences with black people?  For some reason, this hypothesis was never even floated.  Wonder why..."	3	Okay, but factually biased	8ude

2018-10-06 11:04:15	I’m always impressed by thoughtful treatment of complex issues, the humor, and the intelligence that these two offer.  Because they bring on scholars and experts, I feel like I’m being informed, this is the true form of journalism.  Often when people talk about race they try so hard to be “neutral” that they end up being dishonest about the realities of race in this country.  I also love the “what’s bringing you life” music at the end of each episode, I’ve added several new artist to my list as a result of this show.	5	Gene & Shereen are amazing	Husl2014

Or, at least hold these opinions now, and actively participate in prison solidarity work.

One topic I’d like to hear expanded upon is the idea of racial justice.

To hear y’all explore the writings, teachings, and political activism of important PoC like Angela Davis, Caesar Chavez, Frants Fannon, or Malcolm X (or even important, more radical figures like Thomas Sankara or Emiliano Zapata), and frame those works/actions into how we achieve not just racial equality, but true liberation from colonial and capitalist exploitation of all working class people of color.

Even a brief introduction from a political activist/organizer currently working, would be incredible to hear from y’all!

2018-07-13 19:42:18	"I've been listening to this podcast since it's inception and have learned a great deal. The show teaches details and true feelings of individuals who are usually not represented in mainstream society. But sometimes I feel like there's a hidden agenda and even a level of unprofessional bias. For example, the episode ""Members of whose tribe?"" took the very strong opinion of one person and used that to express a false and biased reality for all Jews.  This was unprofessional journalism in my opinion and it was hurtful."	3	Thought provoking but often disappointing	Opussama

2018-06-21 04:57:37	I’m so passionate about these topics. Especially being black raised by white parents. I have predominately white friends/coworkers but I feel very different being black. I believe the world perceives me differently then the ones around me. This podcast has helped me see that the issues I think about are not just my own personal observations but true and legit situations. I don’t often feel as if I can speak freely about my opinions. This podcast offers affirmation and allows me to rant and stand on my soapbox in my car while I’m listening!!	5	Love these topics	Scuba Steph

2018-05-25 12:46:58	"I have tries to listen to the episode  “Of Bloodlines and Conquistadors”, and I was appalled at the racial insensitive and condescension of the two women who were chosen to narrate. Neither of them were respectful of the religious beliefs and traditions of the people interviewed.  They laughed, expressed disbelief in certain aspects of the Fiesta de Santa Fe, and didn’t even try to pronounce some of the words correctly.  This episode was not and is not worthy of your show and is a huge insult to the native peoples and to the Hispano of northern New Mexico.
For your information, I am an Angle resident of New Mexico for nearly 25 years, and your correspondents should have been more sensitive and respectful.  You should be ashamed!

2018-05-09 12:36:29	I can’t explain how happy I was when I found this podcast. It’s been a great oasis to retreat to and dwell more diverse American experiences, an experiences more like my own. I do have one hang up. The topics and guests seem to focus on the same general minority groups. I know the hosts’ personal stories and current events will in inevitably influence the stories, but can we mix up a bit? I’m sure there are stories from other less know minority groups that deserve the light. I may be biased, I’m Afro-Caribbean from a non-Latin country, but I thought Code Switch was about race and identity in general. It would be nice to hear about a wider range of indigenous, immigrant and diaspora experiences, and even more nuanced representation of the Black American experience. Otherwise keep up the great work!	4	Mix it up	Mimi Ak.

2018-03-06 07:17:44	"I love this podcast for its ability to be informative on topics/specific subject matter that is often overlooked by our pop culture. It's relevant, insightful, and extremely well researched. Such amazing production; the entire team clearly puts a ton of work into every episode, from the initial concept down to the editing. My mindsets have so often been challenged in the questions they bring up and the dialogue is succinct but incredibly in depth. I cannot emphasize enough how grateful I am for how this show has opened my mind-I start way too many sentences with, ""I was listening to this podcast the other day..."" followed by what I've been processing from Codeswitch. Keep up the fantastic work!"	5	Favorite Podcast	Heidie A
2018-03-05 20:39:20	Code Switch is essential listening for anyone seeking to understand and navigate the complex issues of race that we all — ragardless of race or ethncity — encounter daily. It's thoughtful, smart, accessible, never preachy. It's helped provide clarity when I'm grappling with something, and insight into how behaviors, actions, and culture affect others.	5	Making Sense of a Challenging World	mightyatom

2018-03-04 12:50:54	This podcast is essential listening. It is informative, searing, uplifting, thoughtful. The stories bring to life the nature of race in our country, reinterpreting history by decentering whiteness. Love it.	5	Necessary	Kappy1964

2018-02-28 20:50:21	A splendid podcast telling stories not told enough. Often find that way into a story that truly makes it accessible. For some, poscast is an affirmation - for others provides new insights. A lot of value added for each.	5	Code Switch	TobeyTTT

2018-02-27 20:41:09	Stay exactly the way you are I get plenty of CONservative voices on every other media I listen to. I add emphasis on the “con” because the current voices and leaders that are CONservative are con artists, they preach nothing of their original values and I’d rather not hear that on this podcast. Don’t change a thing.	5	No, don’t change a thing.	Ally Means

2018-02-20 18:39:02	This is a tremendous show for anyone interested in social commentary and social justice.  Gene and Shereen are both excellent correspondents.  I love hearing the scholars and experts that they have on the show.  And they are very responsive to their listeners.  Plus, they have fun so we do too!	5	Truly informative	PeacefulRuralDweller
2018-02-20 12:13:10	They’re commentary is amazing and each episode discusses another important topic. I have learned so much about topics that concern people of backgrounds other than my own and how our struggles in this country do not exist in a vacuum.	5	Fantastic	Borntoobeking
2018-02-19 18:46:19	"This podcast is an amazing way for ALL people who are interested in learning about perspectives and social causes that they may not feel comfortable or informed enough to seek conversations themselves. As a POC this podcast is SO validating. And hearing from my friends (esp. friends who are white) they feel engaged in the conversation without ""taking up space"".

2018-02-08 06:08:24	This was the first podcast that really grabbed me and made me want to be late to work. I appreciate that the episodes are around 30 minutes- perfect for my commute or getting ready in the mornings. I love the way social issues are discussed, in such a way that I have been examining my own biases as well as institutionalized racism. I always look forward to new episodes!	5	Code Switched	Jenny_W
2018-02-03 17:52:28	If Gene and Marisol decided to post daily, I'd be right there with them.  So happy to hear intelligent and emotional deconstruction, introspection and reconstruction of the hard stuff.  Stay courageous!	5	More, more, more	DereksMom99

2018-01-30 03:29:58	I may be too late for this review but as a 50 something white woman who lives in the south I listen because I believe I am never too old to learn and grow. I refuse to let my location or age or skin color define me. I want to be as aware and “woke” ( I hesitate describing myself that way. Seems more authentic if it came from a POC that knows me) as I can possibly be. Code Switch helps me see issues from the perspectives of those in which they most matter. Thank you for teaching me something every time I listen.	5	Why  I listen to code switch	Dinahfitz
2018-01-27 10:33:57	Code Switch has some of the best commentary and reporting out there when it comes to the intersection of identity, politics, culture, and attitudes. This is what’s needed right now.	5	Smart and Thoughtful Commentary	Sweetn230
2018-01-26 17:06:23	“I am a story.” It’s what we all are and it’s time to stop, ask and listen. Love this podcast so much. I am learning, leaning into the discomfort of having been complicit in oppression, and striving to become part of the solution.	5	“I am a story.”	Ocean's mama
2018-01-25 19:32:33	"So often melanin-deficient folx like me are told ""Hey, sit down and just listen!"" This is a fantastic place to sit down, just listen, and learn about the experiences of PoC in our culture. Five stars for quality of reporting, five stars for the thoughtfulness of the commentary - NPR is diverse, and they chose the best of the best for this. It's not the place to stop learning, but it is a must-listen."	5	A very important contribution	Devi-chan
2018-01-24 21:22:44	"Codeswitch team,

I’m not sure I would never claim to be woke as a state of being but after listening to the “R-word in the age of Trump” episode I’m a little less sleepy now. Hearing racism discussed in terms of harm versus character, defining where terms like bigotry and stereotype exist in relation to each other, and how racial language creates tough questions in this age of journalism was really...intense? Powerful? I can’t find the right word to encompass the fact that I kept rewinding this episode over and over to hear it again. I feel better equipped to understand, discuss, and identify racism and racial animus than I was yesterday in a way that fundamentally changes the conversation for me. I admit that it had never occurred to me that using racism as a descriptor of a perpetrators character without discussing the context of harm was itself racist. I am truly happy to have been exposed to this and the codeswitch team has a listener fr life after today. Thank you for the work that you do here.

-Dylan"	5	Important	Dilly5555
2018-01-24 18:57:40	Gripping and thoughtful discussions and reporting with great hosts in Gene Denby and Shereen Marisol Maraji, who bring warmth, wit, incisive analysis, and a necessary sense of urgency to every episode. I was particularly grateful for the recent episode “The R-word in the age of Trump,” and how critically it engaged with journalism in general and NPR in particular.	5	A+	lmr1977
2018-01-24 18:38:12	"Codeswitch is excellent and balanced journalism on issues of race and ethnicity in our culture. I love that they share opposing views to help bring broader perspective to issues that are highly relevant to our current culture.

PS, please do a podcast on the treatment of Puerto Rico historically and today."	5	Best Podcast on Race/Ethnicity/Culture	Jagzier
2018-01-24 17:18:53	Love Gene and Shereen's radio chemistry - always feels like I'm listening to two friends being honest and transparent with each other (even though I'm sure they have a lot more they'd like to say about certain topics that are not fit for NPR!). I especially enjoyed the multi-episode series about Ron Brown High, and hope that Code Switch can do something like that again to really dig into their stories. Never have come across a Code Switch episode I didn't like.	5	Always fascinating	Ototototo
2018-01-24 16:29:27	Finally something on NPR that isn’t so WHITE or washed down. (No disrespect Terry Gross✊🏾) NPR 2018 Do better. Let me hear from the Native Americans, Asian, Mexicans.Not just dominated by stories of white people	5	5⭐️’S +	Morgan313
2018-01-20 23:49:48	I love this podcast! The topics and guests are relevant and interesting and the conversation is honest, nuanced and fresh. I wish these voices and views were heard more often in the media. I wish they were dropping episodes more often. Can’t get enough!	5	Deep, serious, funny, real	Melissa6500
2018-01-20 17:41:21	I learn so much from each episode. The reporting and storytelling are top-notch, and I can tell that the hosts are deeply passionate about the issues raised in each episode. Thank you for your work in bringing these stories to the world.	5	Every episode is worth your time	ForTheLoveLover
2018-01-19 22:31:08	Episode 1 of this podcast -- on whiteness -- changed my life when I heard it my junior year of high school. I LOVE GENE and all the other contributors. I'd love a follow-up episode on whiteness since the first one was so good. Keep up the good work. As a college sophomore, I constantly reccomend this podcast to friends, professors, and family.	5	Been listening since episode 1	REF2020

2018-01-18 13:45:52	You guys are fabulous!!!! You manage to be both fierce and compassionate on what, for many, are such sensitive subjects. I look forward to every episode.	5	Amazing	papabear1737
2018-01-18 04:44:11	5/5 podcast. Only critique is that once a week isn’t enough! It would be great if you could do a mailbag/Twitter show once a week where you just answer questions from listeners and give takes on current events.	5	Stay Woke	krfire221242
2018-01-18 00:57:49	I dream of my (sociology) students growing up to sit around talking over coffee and their own brilliance, moving all kinds of discussions forward, upward, and down deep deep deep just like this. Tuesdays are my favorite day now, because while I cook dinner, I can think with Gene Demby and Shereen Marisol Meraji and their guests. I don't know how I would have made it through the last year without the Code Switch podcast.	5	Like the best class ever	joanilla
2018-01-17 17:00:16	"Love the conversations, love the thoughtful questions, and love the subjects that y’all talk about!! Highly recommended!

2018-01-15 16:07:54	Tackles important and at times heartbreaking topics with depth, sincerity, and candor. I always learn something new and occassionally tear up.	5	Incredible reporting	hella808
2018-01-15 12:34:01	I am a big fan. With both information sourcing and news selection criteria getting more difficult every day, this program reliably eases my anxiety by providing thorough reporting. Conveniently (for their proverbial reader), they seem to naturally be predisposed to considering their stories responsibly. Make no mistake, they are giving voice those who have no voice, but not without scrutinizing it as well.	5	Advocacy versus Bias	FrankPrewitt
2018-01-14 06:37:10	Thank you for this show. Every episode opens my eyes to something I have never considered fully, and I am grateful for that.

2018-01-13 22:42:05	"Thank you.  Thank you for your dedication.  Thank you for your patience.  Thank you for the times you’ve allowed us to see you losing your patience. Thank you for connecting me to the humanity I’ve been blind to.
I have much more hope for the world my girls will share with Soleil because of the time I’ve spent with the code switch team.
Thank you."	5	Thank you.	jpmurton
2018-01-13 16:14:20	As an older, white American, one who believed he was aware of America’s racism problem, Code Switch has shown me I had no idea of what it really means to be black. Some episodes are funny, some not so much, but all are entertainingly informative. I especially recommend the episode “This Racism Is Killing Me Inside.” We all, but especially white Americans, need to become aware of, awakened to the reality of the continuing racism in our culture and in our country, and the devastating and corrosive effect it has had and is still having on black Americans and on us all as Americans. Please listen.	5	Code Switch is a MUST Hear	NickCHPA
2018-01-13 13:19:55	Code Switch has it all: charismatic hosts, thoughtful research, superb editing and storytelling, and surprising angles on important topics. Code Switch is my model when I write podcasts and articles. The weed boom article, the article about Mary Hamilton, the school of kings series - each episode raises the bar for other podcasts. NPR, I think you should invest whatever resources are necessary in this team so they can produce episodes every day.	5	I want this podcast every day	Amihatt

2018-01-09 14:18:20	I love the way this show has incorporates news items and the social impact of these new motions. If more people saw how the bills and laws that are being passed actually effect our daily lives we might actually see progress. The stories are brief but in-depth and I love hearing the hosts personal take, though they still allow space for other opinions.	5	Hope through the continued diminishing of humanity	Brad Silk
2018-01-09 13:08:07	Sometimes I find it hard to listen to Codeswitch because it’s real journalism, real peoples lives, real struggle. I let my queue fill up with fresh episodes until I have the heart (until I feel brave enough) to dive in, and I’m glad when I do. Codeswitch is the media I wish I had access to growing up, instead of the polarized general tv news media and angry, liberal radio. I’m grateful to have access to it now. Sometimes, when I’m not even listening to it I hear, in my head, the hosts signing off: “peace, be easy.”	5	Vital and Heart-full	Phobean
2018-01-08 22:34:28	Re-experiencing my childhood AND adulthood with these entertaining and thoughtful reporters from a perspective that was not carried by the Networks. Change the world, never stop learning. Great show.	5	Love the lens	Monkeyman13579
2018-01-06 22:12:30	I've just finished listening to every episode of Code Switch, and it consistently confronts me- a white, upper-middle class, Republican-raised woman- with questions that make me uncomfortable.  I have twinty-nine years worth of historical and cultural catching up to do and Code Switch not only introduces those ideas to me, but is unapologetic about the fact that they are not necessarily for or about me, and the culture I grew up in cannot be considered the norm.  That's difficult for me, and I value Code Switch deeply for it.  You have a listener for life.	5	It's good to be uncomfortable	maryrburns
2018-01-05 23:24:34	I enjoy all the topics they speak on, not just mainstream issues and topics from social media, but problems and issues that I can personally relate to. Thank you for having an intelligent program that’s also entertaining and relatable!	5	NPR for me	Jennymcelle

So discovering Code Switch, I feel less alone. Hearing stories of other People of Color or Mixed-Race hears gives me a place in the world. I love how Gene and Shereen approach stories with an empathetic and participatory voice. It just makes me so happy that this podcast exists. And if you haven’t heard the year of love and struggle in a new high school episodes, then please go listen, they were great.	5	Gives me life	MixedGirlMane

2017-11-09 20:20:36	Thanks for collaborating to create these excellent discussions! I love many of the show topics, but my current favorite is the coverage of Ron Brown in Washington D.C. This show has a great approach where many minds from different backgrounds come together to contribute insight to really important current events. Please keep making the magic.	5	Great, relevant discussions!	cmandolin81
2017-11-09 18:56:46	Gene Demby, Shereen Marisol Miraji, Kat Chow, and company are always on point, always on fire. Code Switch examines themes on race, ethnicity, and culture and the ways they impact our lives and communities. It's a must-listen.	5	A must-listen	HopefulLeigh
2017-11-07 23:08:26	I absolutely love this podcast. Literally every time an episode ends I think “already??” I want it to be twice as long! I feel like I’m hanging out with warm, funny, incisive, friends. The main hosts gene and shirin are incredibly engaging and intelligent. Their reporting manages to be focused and far-reaching. The explanatory comma episode (I know, sounds boring) has stuck with me and I think about it regularly. It was mind blowing. I learn something from this show regularly, but it doesn’t feel in any way “educational” or “explanatory”. I can’t recommend this show more highly.	5	SO GOOD	amirjoon

2017-11-02 12:46:14	"I just got done listening to the 3-part series on the D.C. school, Ron Brown College Prep High School. The series impacted me so much, I actually shed some tears. The quality of the reporting and all-sides immersion of the day-to-day work and challenges in the school really shed light on how difficult it is to bring about change within institutions, especially schools— even when certain policies directly affect generations of black and brown students. The best of NPR is this podcast. If you haven’t subscribed, you should."	5	Phenomenal	T-McD
2017-11-01 15:21:10	I love the topics they cover and share this podcast often with my students.	5	Great topics, conversation	Ottusch
2017-11-01 11:24:29	Code switch is the finest and most provoking podcast I listen to each week. This latest series challenged so many of my biases about public education. The reporters did a great job of laying bare the challenges of educating young men in unstable, often impoverished circumstances. I became so interested in the students and staff/teachers.	5	Magnificent coverage of the Ron Brown school	Ardrigh
2017-10-30 18:39:52	This is my #1 go-to for people who aren't living the code switch experience trying to understand race in America.

2017-10-03 18:48:42	This podcast has been one of the best experiences for me as a black man in my adult life. It equips me with some really great tools and knowledge for how to go talk to my friends and family about issues important to me, and keeps me informed about issues others don’t report on. Being able to have a direct line into issues concerning people of color with a top notch team is an amazing experience and I thank this team for that.

They don't need to say ""it sounds simple, right?"" anymore before breaking the news that it's complicated though. We know that it's complicated.

I like this show and the hosts a lot. It's great when Adrian Florido is on to. NPR should have these guys on all their shows instead of people who cannot pronounce non-white things. Until then, keep up the good work y'all!"	5	Short and sweet	TheRealKatherine
2017-09-27 14:53:13	I always look forward to a new episode of Code Switch. They provided a needed perspective and I often learn something. This podcast has helped me to recognize when my world view is skewed. Thanks!	5	Love	NTinSF

Thanks for that ""Code Switch""."	5	Mo newz	Mikky D
2017-09-21 14:43:45	This is by far one of the best NPR podcasts out there. The reporting is thorough, timely, important, and incredibly interesting.

2017-09-15 01:19:14	The show is engaging and contains interesting and necessary conversations.  I feel like it could use more input from white people, as they are often a subject but not well represented.  That being said, overall it is a great podcast.  I am a white male.  I  am interested to hear the input and learn how I can better myself and my interactions with others.	4	Interesting conversations!	Mfrancic
2017-09-10 04:47:11	I've been listening to this podcast since episode 1, and it always challenges me to learn more about each topic. Depending on the episode, it might make you laugh or cry, but you'll definitely leave each episode thinking about the world we live in.	5	My favorite podcast ever	Apo1026
2017-09-09 19:15:21	The subjects that this podcast tackles are not easy ones, and -- as some of the comments below reveal -- may trigger defensive reactions from those who have difficulty seeing the experience of 'the other' as legitimate. I don't always agree with everything that is said in this podcast, nor should I expect to. My experience as a must-ethnic person of Asian and European background is undoubtedly different than that of some of the guests or hosts, but it's important to hear the diversity of perspective that's out there. Thank you for challenging me at times, affirming me at others.	5	Consistently thought provoking	LA Hapa
2017-09-09 05:02:38	I love this podcast. It's has interesting stories that I don't hear anywhere else! The history of hispanics in the census changed my life. I recommend this podcast to everyone.	5	Best Podcast ever!!	ValdezMarissa2018
2017-09-07 17:02:28	I'm a white dad to two adopted black sons, both of whom are now young adults. Honestly, I started listening to this just to get a better perspective on BLM, but it quickly showed me how much I had to learn and how deeply entrenched I was in (and ignorant about) my own white male privilege. Now, a couple of years later, it is by far one of my all-time favorite podcasts. I listen to some podcasts (S-town, Ted Radio Hour, On Being, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text) for entertainment, but Code Switch actually helps me be a better dad, better American, better world citizen, and a better human. Yes, sometimes it's challenging and uncomfortable, and sometimes I even sob uncontrollably when I'm confronted with something especially hard. Plus, the hosts are just phenomenal. How often do you get such genuine transparency and authenticity as the hosts grapple with their own issues too?  This show and its contributors are a treasure.	5	Code Switch makes me a better person	EnerSanctum

2017-08-27 17:58:43	I'm extremely grateful for this show. The staff are passionate and dedicated. Each episode is interesting. Sometimes I'm shocked or flabbergasted with the views shared in their reporting, but then I'm relieved because that's why I choose to listen to this podcast. I'm white, and while there are people of color in my life, I never get a chance to be a fly on the wall and listen to their concerns as they share them with each other. More often than not, I find myself on the same page or at least sympathetic to the views expressed on Code Switch, but when it is uncomfortable or disruptive it's a healthy, educational discomfort. Thanks to EVERYBODY on the team. Be easy!	5	Grateful for This Show	Curtis216

2017-08-27 00:27:53	And honest, fresh way to learn about cultures other than my own, and to hear answers to questions I might never have asked.

2017-08-25 17:58:07	"The word ""conversation"" gets thrown around a lot for how to educate more of us and constructively progress on multiculturalism. Code Switch is actually having these conversations, and it has inspired me to have a lot of real conversations with my family and friends as well. I'm white and I enjoy at times feeling challenged, even angry at what I hear. It means they're doing something right. I acknowledge that educating white people is not always their mission - it's on me to supplement their reporting and interviews with other research and life experience."	5	Code Switch is having the hard conversations	dinobren

2017-08-24 00:11:57	"This show makes me, a 60-year-old white person, work hard. And I often feel a little beat up after I listen. And I keep listening. Every week. Because I need to learn. 

As a woman, as a lesbian, I know how it feels to want to be seen and heard. I know how important allies are. I want to be the best ally I can to people of color. So I listen.

I don't agree with everything. Since the show is produced by people much younger than I, I don't even understand some of it. But I listen. Because we, white people, need to hear these voices. And these strong, vibrant, committed young people have so much to say. Thank you for sharing your wisdom."	5	School of Hard Knocks	sharoncita2000

2017-08-19 13:48:49	"Code Switch is incredibly important for our society today. As someone who learned the term code switch when I was a white teacher in an all black school in DC, I am personally very passionate about the importance of being able to authentically and safely exist in various spaces in our society. (No, it was not TFA. I was not ""assigned"" to this school. This was a job I chose and loved.) For me, it meant valuing and respecting my new community in the same way I would any new culture in which I chose to live. Learning the language, the customs, the history, and the value system. For my job as a teacher, to get linguistically nerdy, that meant I taught my students that learning standard American English (SAE) was about adding a language to their fluency in black english vernacular (BEV) while also learning about and honoring the beauty and rich history and importance of BEV. I wanted them to learn the skill of code switching without internalizing the linguistic and cultural oppression society tries to put on them.

Now that I'm in corporate America in predominantly white spaces, I find myself struggling to put the experience I had and the lessons I learned into words. This podcast provides a perfect primer. When I'm explaining that health, safety, neighborhood access, and education are tied to skin color, it helps immensely to be able to point folks to Code Switch's first episode as a place where colleagues can explore their whiteness in the safety of their homes before re-engaging in the discussion.

So grateful to Gene and Sherine and all of the Code Switch Team. Hope y'all bein easy too."	5	A Must Listen for All Americans.	BlancoBen
2017-08-19 03:03:41	I've enjoyed this podcast for a while now, and the commentary on Charlottesville was some of the best I've heard.  As  white teacher in a super-diverse classroom, I've been able to use some of the content to deepen my own and my students' understandings of race in America.  I continue to be grateful for the way this team grapples with a multitude of different issues.  Keep it up!	5	Insightful	Wagnearo

2017-08-12 17:44:10	"As a Spanish teacher who builds curriculum and themes around social justice themes I have to give huge props to Gene and Marisol as two of the most valuable curators of topics that affect my students and my greater community, global and local. I i've been listening to your podcast since it came on the scene and I would encourage anyone in education to listen to all its episodes and inform their practice from the crucial conversations that take place here. Especially if you teach AP Spanish, US, or global history courses! 

I started donating to Code Switch and Latino USA monthly because of the many deep conversations inside and out of class, as well as meaningful projects, that have come from the topics and perspectives these two bring to the fore. It even informed my classroom management, and now he say""code Switch!"" In my classes to remind students to reframe their self talk or talk to one another. 

My latest example comes from Code Switch's concluding ritual: they ask show participants to share a song that is ""giving them life"". After talking about what are often painful and fraught subjects, sharing words and melodies raises the vibration and reminds everyone to keep moving forward. I asked my students to do the same thing to kick off the new semester and we play those songs as they walk into class. Music is just one more way to affirm people and their experiences, helps me get to know my students, and creates a bridge for all of them to talk about why their song raises their spirits. 

Thank you for asking the difficult questions and addressing harsh realities with candor and grace. They educate me about the language and lenses needed to examine social iniquities in a culturally responsive way (without losing sight of our country's myriad of racial, linguistic and social ASSETS!

At times it is uncomfortable, at times it gels something I knew, at times it is funny.

2017-07-09 15:27:30	This podcast features well told and fascinating stories. As a suburban white guy I've learned tons about the experiences of others from Code Switch that I might not have otherwise been exposed to.	5	Highly recommend	BTGoldberg
2017-07-08 22:32:49	The Code Switch team is doing important work with this podcast, and doing it ~very~ well. This podcast is a multifaceted exploration of the way people experience race and culture in their lives, and the journalism and storytelling is consistently solid.	5	High-quality journalism	MoonySBCB
2017-07-06 23:54:54	I'm white. (And more than that but still, white.) In the past I found it hard to talk about race. And I sometimes found it uncomfortable to talk to folks who were not my own race - all these elephants in the room. This podcast has helped me talk about race and reflect on complicated identities including my own and the contexts we live in, historically and day to day. It's also really well structured and voiced. The hosts ask great questions, and offer super solid reflections let it end the way it started: Complicated.	5	Helps me talk about race	DianaNeptune

2017-06-30 18:34:08	I can't get enough of Code Switch. As a white woman, I spent most of my life submerged in the myth of a post-racial America, and it's taken me far too long to awaken to the reality of so many of my fellow Americans. Resources like Code Switch have been absolutely invaluable in the journey of deeply listening, deeply seeing, and learning to mourn with those who mourn. I'm so grateful for their work and the high-quality material they produce. Thank you!!!	5	Top-notch journalism, eye-opening social critique	Kay ben-Avraham
2017-06-30 23:19:48	"I've listened to this podcast from the first episode and enjoy several other podcasts that focus on issues of diversity, race, gender, and generational differences. 

Although I don't relate to or agree with the opinions in every episode, I appreciated hearing the different perspectives and felt the show was trying to inform and promote better understanding and unity across all groups of people - until the anniversary episode. 

They spent the entire first segment berating, and even mocking, one of their listeners who had written in.  It was retaliatory and rude, alienating people who are actually seeking to be more inclusive and informed on issues of race and culture.  This cast prefers to exclude anyone who doesn't know what Nollywood is or doesn't get every ""Roots"" quote or obscure pop culture reference. ""What is wrong with these people?!?"", they say, ""Just google it!"".  Thank you. I will."	1	Judgmental	Heidi8380
2017-06-28 17:20:45	As a first generation Indian American this podcast has discussed issues I've never heard the media. Its been amazing to hear stories that relate to my culture and identity. You can tell the hosts and creators are trying their best. Sometimes they may make a mistake and in my book that's ok. At least they are trying their best and open to being told they messed up. (example: episode on tupac where they alienated some of their audience/ they tackled this head on) I've also enjoyed hearing the episodes that I don't relate to directly.	5	Issues I've never heard diss used elsewhere	Skeshav
2017-06-28 16:42:45	After a year of listening to the Code Switch podcast, I find that the topics the team engages in are usually extremely thought-provoking, and challenge my own way of thinking, which I really value. I love the varied perspectives, and the way they promote critical thinking.	5	Challenging, Thoughtful Stories Told by Voices You Don't Always Hear	FoxieJD

2017-06-27 05:46:11	Excellent, even in its imperfection. Most of these bad reviews are ridiculous/show little understanding or appreciation of structural racism.	4	Strong effort	CecilFarker
2017-06-22 14:49:57	Race is one of the most difficult conversations to have, but also necessary. Sorry white people (of which I am one), race is still an issue in the US and open discussion is essential.	5	Of course it's hard to listen to sometimes...	Chef LizzyO

2017-06-16 18:46:52	Code switch chooses really interesting and engaging stories to dig into. The follow up on those stories has the team talking to informative and often entertaining people who are either experts on the topic or have first hand experience. The production of the show is great and overall I would recommend it strongly.	5	Interesting and entertaining show	Artistanal
2017-06-16 00:56:20	I really love this podcast. It's interesting that because the first episode was about whiteness, a lot of the reviews have focused on that- especially the negative ones. I have found in subsequent episodes rich conversations about multiple aspects of race and how it intersects with other experiences. I have found reflections of my own multiracial experience that are hard to come by in the media. I have even enjoyed the discussions about pop culture, like television shows, which I sometimes get bored with.	5	multi-faceted	L_inmotion
2017-06-15 14:19:41	Really coming into its own. A great episode to start with is Gene Demby's interview with Moonlight director Barry Jenkins.	5	This show keeps getting better and better.	Motttt
2017-06-14 23:46:51	Found this one when looking for interesting conversations about Get Out. Since then, I've gone through the back catalog and remain subscribed. Great pieces on so many aspects of cultural and racial conversations--multi-racial identity, the explanatory comma, the wider meanings of the US flag. Thanks to this whole crew who makes such an engaging, thoughtful and vital contribution to the world.	5	Quickly became a fan	Weems
2017-06-14 03:08:07	"I love this podcast!  So much of what I know (or think I know) about race comes from white people.  This podcast has given me the opportunity to learn about issues affecting people of color, from people of color.  My opinions have been challenged in so many ways since starting this podcast, and it's allowed me to view issues from a different perspective.  I highly recommend it!

As a side note, Scene on Radio's series ""Seeing White"" (ep. 31-) deals more with the history of whiteness in America.  That's another eye-opener I'd recommend, particularly for other white listeners, like me."	5	Thanks, Code Switch!	ambolm
2017-06-06 20:14:22	I'm a white, straight, female listener. While I don't always agree with -- or even understand -- what's discussed on this show, I have listened to every single episode and shared several with friends and family. Being exposed to these viewpoints is so valuable, precious even, that I find this podcast necessary in the current political and artistic environment. Agreeing or not agreeing is really not the point: this is a podcast America needs.	5	New ideas	vanguard16
2017-06-10 13:34:32	Having listened for a while now, I can honestly say that the podcast has been pushing my ideas about race and culture in today's society, in such a positive way! I appreciate the honesty and the candid conversations happening and glad I can share in them through this podcast. My only wish most times is that the episodes would be longer! Most times it feels we only scratch the surface of a great conversation and cut it off too early!	4	Pushing good conversations!	sarahh0101

2017-05-27 19:32:25	"I am so glad that this podcast exists, and is available to a pretty ""mainstream"" audience of podcast listeners. It brings up critically-important topics and conversations that our society needs to be having much more widely. 

Sometimes it feels a little too much like you're tiptoeing the line in terms of trying not to state things too forcefully or offend (presumably white) listeners who aren't comfortable with a more frank analysis of racism and institutionalized racism in our society...but I understand the challenge you face, and I think you're a really important source of information and awareness for that audience. 

I just wish there was a ""Code Switch 2.0"" for those of us who would like to hear a more advanced or nuanced, less tentative/apologetic/gentle version of these conversations. It feels like on the current show, sometimes you dance around flat-out stating the obvious conclusions, and thus the show misses its punch.  

Nonetheless....keep up the great work you're doing, it's really really important. Thank you."	5	Very grateful for the existence of this podcast	Arizwa

2017-03-07 06:57:43	"This was a very enlightening podcast. Most of the 1 star reviews are from people who listened to 1 podcast, saw the words ""white people"" and racial fragility made them give it one star without even listening. Very weird, as Code Switch routinely has White people delicately speak on their first hand account of whiteness and performances of it, but still other white identifying people erupt. Compare that to the  400 years media-based of racial essentialism and disparagement by members of the majority  yet POC only remonstrate this much if someone says racial slurs, not just say the word ""Asian"", ""black"", etc. Also, I see a few POC giving it low stars because it's racialized. Sad. Robin DeAngelo is a genius because she crafted a theory of social defensiveness (""white fragility"") that is applicable to all raced and sexed categories. That is, some POC exhibit more fragility (usually white fragility) than white-identified people themselves. Listen to Code Switch so that you can deconstruct race and stop letting it govern your life. Racism exist. See? I said and didn't spontaneously combust."	5	Ignore 1 star comments	Nietzsche-Preacher
2017-03-09 18:35:18	"So on the latest episode there was a panel discussion on ""allyship."" The women on the panel proceeded to disparage the motives of their white friends and allies for a solid half hour. One women even claimed that white people cannot even be allies to PoC, because doing so only reinforces their privilege. These kind of moral purity tests could not be more uncharitable and self defeating. I can't imagine going about my life with this level of suspicion and resentment towards my fellow human beings. The people on this panel may indeed be victims of societal oppression. But more than that, they're victims of their own cynicism."	1	Cult of Victimhood	WhiskeyKnight
2017-03-06 22:46:59	Great podcast that brings up sometimes uncomfortable (as evidenced by the salty reviews) but necessary topics about race and class. My only complaint is that they don't upload their pods more frequently! Good stuff!	5	Especially relevant!	GarlippKnot

I'd argue that this issue is not about race. It's a little hipster to say, ""if you don't know who this is, I'm not going to tell you."" As culture gets bigger and more segmented, I think the explanatory comma will be even more necessary to ensure that everyone is warmly welcomed to the discussion. Terry Gross (no comma needed) always introduces her guests. And, even though I'm way white dude, without her explanations I'd generally have no idea if she was talking to an author, painter, singer or politician."	4	Explanatory Comma	LifeInPhilly

2017-02-22 02:14:23	"I was very hopeful about this podcast from the 1sode. Then...-It has become 'mainstream 'about race. The opportunity to open a  real analytical, self-reflective conversation among races got lost pretty quickly. A white host voice is missing, for a round table on equality. ""whitness is elastic"" (from ep 1) so true, but elasticity is not among whites only. Where is your reflection  on that? - (on Black Oscar ep) FACT is:Van Jones went on and interviewed AA that voted for 45. (so did latinos, and other ethnicities) were is the self reflection on race on these realities? - Again. You went mainstream. The issues are way more complex. You are sticking to your comfort zone.3 stars for effort. -  P.W."	3	Sticking to the comfort zone- not good enough	Petra46
2017-02-20 19:32:15	This is the show I've been waiting for NPR to produce and now that it's here it is so much better than I thought it would be. NPR is often easy listening, and this is not. It's challenging, civil, and voicing perspectives that aren't readily heard. Constantly introspective, and with my own explanatory comma - This is because the editorial decisions appropriate for this show are not canonized. Euphemisms are outted. Keep up the hip hop interstitials - make me feel at home.	5	I am so thankful for these conversations	mp707
2017-02-17 23:57:27	I started listening to this at the end of 2016 because it was obvious everyone needs to have more empathy for everyone else, and some need to work on this more than others.

2017-01-28 17:55:57	One of the best podcasts to come out of NPR, ever... Thank you!! Don't change the format ever - always have this show be done by people of color, and keep it as candid and real as possible.	5	Excellent! About time!	C Rattat

Yes, I do a lot of Googling after the show to find out more about topics (or artists/activists/etc) they discuss, but I think that's good.

Unforturnately most white people have no idea what it is like to navigate different worlds/cultures as people of color must do.

2017-01-06 04:57:19	I'm so thankful for this podcast - in a recent episode, they explored the 'explanatory comma' explaining who or what non-White people or culture are - but I'm grateful all the podcasters & writers on Code Switch share their thoughts and reactions. Leaving a review here to thank them for this work!	5	Thankful	Flammifera
2017-01-04 20:49:57	"Long-time listener, first time review. The Real Talk episode on Obama and race is a treasure, in part because it looks back at the reactionary and counterproductive forces set loose during the past eight years.  It reflects the kind of daring and thoughtful talk on race and culture that has made Code Switch a part of any well rounded podcast diet.

For all of the reviews crying bias or racism, the reviews seem to have come from a place that has either not listened to NPR over the years, had a very pedestrian understanding of race and racism, or just haven't cared to listen.  Because any of these tasks would require the listener to stop thinking that s/he is not the center of the universe."	5	Urgent, provocative, and thoroughly needed	Bicoastal_pocho

2016-12-29 23:24:17	"These guys (note: they will cry bloody murder to me referring to them all as ""guys"") are analogous to the tea party's relationship to moderate republicans. Code switch is a podcast that is actually a support group for overly sensitive hacks who preach about respect and freedom and repressing oppression by repressing freedom and respect for anyone who says or thinks differently. For example, they complain as nauseum about the Other, yet claim to be Other-ized.  This podcast is in desperate need of a reality check."	1	Code switch = what tea party is to moderate republicans	173764ehsbd
2016-12-26 12:29:35	I subscribed to Code Switch a while ago and listen to the episodes periodically but have accumulated a bit of a backlog. On a long drive a couple days ago, I went through the episodes back to back. As far as I'm concerned, there is a ton of value/perspective in these episodes...listening to the topics and contributors back to back and juxtaposed to each other was even better. There are so many themes that emerge over and over again...one of which was simply the importance of thinking about people as whole, complex beings not the oversimplified versions that are portrayed so often. Like other reviewers, I was surprised and not surprised to see some of the other reviews here and I agree that many of the reviews capture why the existence of the podcast is so important.	5	Thumbs Up	Aviself
2016-12-21 01:05:36	Love this show! Makes me think about issues in a way that I normally wouldn't think to, given my background and experience. We need to have more conversation like this as a nation.	5	Excellent podcasts	Devlinjade

2016-12-20 02:46:22	I want to start this off by saying I have listened to every episode they have put out and will continue to listen to every episode they put out to gain a better understanding of the regressive left. According to NPR audience demographics listed on their site, they have an overwhelming listener base of wealth whites living in affluent cities and suburbs. This particular program is clearly market to their main demographic as well as affluent POCs living in mostly white areas. Their views on the reality most white people experience can easily be disproven if you have ever ventured an hours drive out of your major city. They have no problem trying to tell you about your own life experiences but would be all to quick to call you a racist if you did the same. They have this notion that white people are uncomfortable talking about race. I have to agree, but this is because it is not a conversation. We are expected to listen to how horrible we are and when we bring up a time a crime was committed against us that we felt was due to the color of our skin, we get labeled a racist. This podcast only focuses on how white wrong other races and never tackles bigotry between ethnic groups other than whites. Unfortunately, because they have been so successful in gaining listeners within their target market their bigotry will never be exposed.	1	Bigots preaching to a white guilt ridden audience	Ilsickness
2016-12-15 19:29:31	"I may have a misconception or two regarding the premise of the podcast.  After a number of episodes I'm coming to feel that the show is comprised of people of color speaking about various aspects of living in a white-media dominated society.  The conversation is between individuals who identify as people of color, but I would reiterate one listener email which said that it doesn't feel like everyone is invited into the conversation.  The hosts have a tendency to reflect on their experiences against a backdrop of white interpretation but leave a lot on the table in regards to interpretations of various ethnic groups by other groups. Or how about addressing the sliding scale of cultural awareness?  I'd like for there to be white participant in the conversation as well as maybe a person openly acknowledging that they don't fit the mold of their skin color.  There just seems to be a missed opportunity to touch on cultural nuances.  I want to hear about life in between the lines.  Not just from one side about he other.

I have hope for this podcast but i feel it needs to grow."	2	One-way code switch	WhoCares1980
2016-12-15 13:16:34	"Perhaps because it's an NPR podcast, I've seen feedback that criticizes Code Switch for making white people feel ""left out."" As a white person, I'm very frustrated when white people expect themselves to be centered in every conversation. I have never felt left out as a Code Switch listener. When topics come up that make me feel confused or uncomfortable, it encourages me to interrogate *why* I'm uncomfortable or research so I'm no longer confused. I hope that the hosts, producers, and people who make funding decisions for the show recognize that provoking this sort of discomfort is a strength of the show, not a weakness.

Gene's recent interview with Barry Jenkins, the director of the film Moonlight, is a good example of how centering black experience generates higher quality content. Jenkins's comfort with Gene and Gene's interview style seemed to provoke a much more insightful conversation than I would have heard if they had spoken to each other explicitly with a white audience in mind. It reminded me that I felt the same way when Gene interviewed Ezra Edelman about OJ: Made in America. I'm tired of hearing people of color justify their art, and their existence, to white gatekeepers. I am much more interested in what they say when they're given a platform to speak in a space where the validity of their experience is taken as a given. Code Switch is that kind of space, and I continue to fascinated by what I learn from hearing them speak from it.

And Gene and Shereen are great. I love their easy rapport with one another and their willingness to ask each other, and themselves, tough questions."	5	Important Conversations from an Important Space	Edprst

2016-12-10 17:04:33	While not every episode is (I think) long enough or dives deep enough into the issues at hand - some are more like footnotes than full chapters - it's nevertheless been great to hear commentary from a specifically minority perspective. As a white woman, I don't necessarily even need them to go deep on everything - just hearing their non-white perspectives on bigger and smaller things alike - expands my own.

I wanted to know more about what people of color where experiencing and thinking about and the first  Code/SWitch podcast I heard was ""whiteness'. That was not the first motivator in my journey to support racial justice and equality, since I had previously read, with shock and disgust, that extreme racial injustice, for the most part, has merely changed its form since post civil war times. But this podcast adds a new level of understanding that increased my desire to learn more, participate and support those in the midst of this continuing and worsening crisis."	5	Code/Switch	Pogonap

2016-11-23 22:28:15	It would be great to have more racial diversity/inclusion in regards to the topics covered. It's not bad, but it's not great. Example: DAPL has been a topic of discussion for 8+ months and they haven't covered it. Just like the rest of the mainstream media, native issues go unnoticed, pushed beyond the general public's concern. I was hoping for better than the status quo, but alas...	2	Meh	👁❤️👁

2016-11-15 22:17:25	"This is a great podcast. Especially if you're white and you'd like to be more educated and informed about race... because as a white person, you really don't have to know this stuff. So you have to try! Just read through some of the negative comments on here... almost all of them are from white people who really should listen to this because they honestly have no idea what they're talking about... they didn't learn anything because they obviously weren't listening (or were so offended by being called white or privileged (which they are) that they just didn't pay attention). If you're white and you care about ""helping the world"", listen to this podcast and others like it (listed below).
I think you'd like this podcast if you like any of the following: Another Round, Hidden Brain, Latino USA, Politically Re-active, Stuff Mom Never Told You, This American Life, Dear Sugar, Death Sex & Money, Intersection, How to be a Girl, Mater Mea, or Revisionist History."	5	Awesome!!!	Csmochilera

Its uncomforatable to challenge preconceptions, especailly if they're well meant.  No one wants to talk about race or diversity or change but the biggest let down of the generation that gave us a real shot at civil equality dropped the ball by pretending the conversation was over.  Untill we get it right, untill we can spend every day taking for granted that our brothers and sisters are being treated with the same respect (or equal disrespect) as we are then we all have a lot of work to do.

2016-10-15 16:15:28	The moment this podcast lost it for me was when Gene recounted a conversation with a white uber driver. He says the driver tried to engage him about one of the unarmed black man police killings, explaining views that differed from Gene's views as well as some misunderstanding. Gene says at this point that he basically checked out of the conversation and gave the woman the cold shoulder because she wasn't worth his time. This stunned me, here you are a -representative of the extremely socially progressive NPR, from a radio show about engaging in talks about race..... really?? Wouldn't the better option have been to engage with the woman and explain your views and try to help her understand how you see the event as a black American? Maybe direct her to your OWN podcast so she can gain a new perspective?!

2016-10-11 20:51:21	"I'm a white guy who's trying to get better at understanding race in the US, so I checked this out. I've listened to about a dozen of the episodes, and there's some really good thought provoking stuff in here. Sometimes its uncomfortable but probably that's good for me. I think there's a real value to being a fly on the wall of people talking openly about their experiences with race (since I always make the conversations I'm in whiter, just by being there).

Two downnotes: there are some times I feel so unprepared for the conversation going on that I don't even have a grasp. I'm not quite sure how much of that is just how much of a novice I am on this topic. It's also pretty dry, even by NPR standards, which makes me gravitate more readily to new episodes of the far more openly-left and openly-funny Politically Re-Active."	4	Pretty solid conversations abotu Race	Lankysam

However, for the ones that are not good (and I listen through the whole thing waiting for it to get better and usually end up disappointed), I feel that the commonality they have is that it sounds like the people are just venting. Some examples of this is the episode on people not saying names correctly and the ""Guide to handling casual racism."" I'm a mujer of color that also experiences racism and other isms, so hearing other people talk about the microaggressions they suffer is boring.

2016-09-21 19:04:46	This podcast is excellent and covers a broad range of issues, all of which are equally valuable and interesting. This podcast is done in such a way that it feels both educational and relatable, meaning it brings to light issues that are necessary for white America to listen to and develop a greater understanding of, while, it seems, also being something that people of color can listen to and feel as though their opinions, thoughts and voices are being represented.  As a white woman married to a man of color (specifically a black man), and who volunteers with a social justice organization where I am inside California prisons, serving predominantly populations of color, it is always valuable for me to hear direct, honest perspectives and experiences from people of color. Thank you for this weekly slice of greatness.	5	Educational & Relatable	bsbs19

2016-09-09 02:00:13	"Conversations about race are never easy. But this podcast's way of doing it is incredible. It's thought-provoking, yet safe (for lack of a better term). Those who don't have to ""code-switch"" in their day to day life would enjoy it if they put aside their immediate notions. It isn't really about race, it's about the intersection of it in our daily lives. I love this show, and the critics who are so quick to judge it based on their fragile feelings of criticism  are not seeing the point. Keep up the great work Code Switch team!"	5	Remarkable, Thoughtful, Necessay	Crissydv

No matter what bad reviews say, this is worth listening as long as youre humble enough to take others' POVs	5	great podcast, despite the rating	anazards
2016-09-06 15:24:34	Especially valuable if you are interested in thinking about issues for underrepresented groups. As a privlidged individual myself I find that their tone is always very upbeat - never offputting. At the same time, they dig into ways of thinking and viewpoints that I have not been exposed to. And it challenges my thinking  - definitely worthwile to keep up with this evolving show	5	Valuable listening	Brtyu7775457
2016-09-07 02:30:25	Some episodes are absolutely searing and so well done--everyone in the whole country should listen to the episode about Philando Castile's driving record. Others are a little more slight and feel unfinished. Overall though, a worthwhile listen most weeks.	4	Great usually, sometimes uneven	hwpw
2016-09-06 01:03:43	This podcast should be required listening for white people. I felt the same about Tell Me More. Good writing. Good topics. Keep this on the air and get rid of the old stuffy programs.	5	The best thing since Michel Martin	Carolsummit

2016-09-05 05:38:46	It started out as a pretty good and interesting podcast with an objective take on race issues and infesting topics pertaining to race, but it slowly seems like they are aiming this towards minority audiences exclusively. I'm a twenty something white male who considers himself to be really open (I started listening to this from its inception), but this podcast makes me lose a little hope in the country ever having a truly objective look at race. Not sure it's possible. Have fun listening to people whine about their names being mispronounced! There's plenty of other great npr podcasts to check out.	1	Not as objective as it may seem	Grantos
2016-09-03 13:14:30	I'm so tired of hearing about racism. If anything it's made me more hard-lined  and intolerable!! It appears that most of the issues in our society are poverty issues not racist issues.	1	If I could give zero stars, I would!	1980Polly1980
2016-08-31 14:04:45	This podcast does a great job of making me pause and think about how race touches life in so many different ways. The episode on Nate Parker really highlighted how difficult race and art and criminal justice can become intertwined - and it brought forward the hypocrisy that we as society seem to have towards famous people and rape culture.

2016-08-23 18:30:05	It's a very good show and it's challenging to listen to because it comes from a perspective that is very different from mine. Yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable at times, but I feel like anything smart will make you uncomfortable from time to time because it's pushing you.	5	Really Challenging and honest	Wookie299
2016-08-24 23:45:19	I listened to the first full episode.  Privileged Americans podcasting their jealousy of privilege white Americans.  We ALL live in the most prosperous's culture in the history of the world.  Instead of encouraging people to embrace the opportunity you encourage people to continue hate.  You are creating more of what you're acting like you are trying to improve.  I beg  you to open your mind to this possibility.	1	I beg your pardon	drewarney
2016-08-22 18:34:06	"I love this podcast. As a white person from a southern state I do not feel berated or abused or ashamed by the presenters and their guests, as some reviewers do. I recognize that I benefit from white privilege but do not feel like anyone is trying to make me feel guilty about it. Instead I feel empathy and try to right wrongs, even if I am not responsible for them. 

This podcast is an attempt to bring up issues of race (and to some extent class), which is awkward and sometimes unpleasant for many white Americans. I applaud any forum that makes an honest effort to confront race head on. I hope that the naysayers will one day calm down enough to truly listen to what is being said, confront their own biases, and open their hearts."	5	A much-needed podcast	Tigerbunny342

2016-08-13 03:23:07	"Let me start by saying if you are white, you may have a tough time listening to these interviews unless you're open to hearing some harsh truths. Full disclosure: I'm ""yellow."" For me it's easy to blend into society without thinking about my race until I am confronted by a slip of a racist comment. These stories are welcome because they remind me of my identity, especially since it's so difficult to talk about these topics when you have non-communicative, first generation parents. I even had to wipe away some tears during the letter read by the Vietnamese girl in an attempt to explain her support for the black lives matter movement to her first generation father. Thank you for all of the work and thought you put into each episode. One suggestion is to do a show on how people handle random racist comments, particularly when they come from friends or coworkers."	5	Hones conversations about race	Rouxdevie

2016-08-12 16:42:55	Liked the idea of this podcast but execution not so good. The 1st ep. was surprisingly mediocre for an NPR show but I listened to a few to give it a chance and they only seemed to get worse. I felt like I was watching a cable-access show of NPR interns talking about their opinions, with very little research or facts offered. The hosts are not particularly informative, entertaining or interesting and it sounds like a bunch of 23 yr olds who think they're informed but are just spouting off subjective opinions, and know very little about life, but are narcissistic enough to think it's compelling. Do us a favor and put them back at research desks and let them learn and 'earn' their way up rather then handing some young-uns a podcast so NPR seems more diverse. I learn more by listening to 2 Dope Queens AND I get a laugh. There has to be more compelling AND experienced diverse voices out there. Give them a shot.	2	Schmeh	Plasticanimalz

At a time when voices of color are being silenced in national media, it is so gratifying to hear these voices speak out about the experiences and frustrations that ""we"" experience.  Since the voices are multiple, I don't always recognize my experience, but that is the insight that I crave.  NPR is centered in the northeast and now California.  I just wish they had more geographically diverse voices on this show.  Keep pushing!"	5	a voice for the voiceless	makeda42
2016-08-07 17:54:01	This show provides a much needed focused discussion about race in the US and equally well serves as a starting point for conversations with loved ones. I'd like to see some more engagement with the conceptual underpinnings of each topic.	5	Excellent show	Alecmt

2016-08-05 20:20:20	I appreciate the space that writers of color have made for themselves in this podcast. It's honest, spoken from their personal experiences and reactions to current news and even reflects the small micro aggressions in daily life. I find it validating to hear these well accomplished people tackling some of the same issues with race, gender and sexuality that I face. I can't wait to hear more.	5	Don't Believe the Hate	Chuggface
2016-08-06 14:27:21	But not what I thought it would be. There was 1 really great episode after Dallas. But the other episodes were seemingly young journalist taking about their personal lives and interviewing their friends. Meh, I I subscribed.	3	Listen for yourself	Angelstar260
2016-08-03 20:45:44	Every Code Switch episode I listen to gives me greater insight as to what it means to be a person of color in this country. This episode was such an eye opening lesson for me as it reminded me once again to always keep an open and questioning mind while listening to anything from the media. To question who their sponsors are, who they think their listeners are and what are their reasons for the report. Thank you for your excellent thought provoking podcast.	5	"What does ""Objectivity"" mean to Journalists of Color"	CCRedmond
2016-08-05 04:14:22	"I love the concept behind this series. We should all seek out different perspectives and experiences. The hosts are likable and don't pretend to have all the answers. However, that's what's often most frustrating: the episode concludes with the hosts admitting they don't have answers to our current problems and while that's fair, it somewhat mitigates the point of the podcast. If every hot button issue concludes with ""I don't know"" it doesn't inspire more confidence to tune in each week."	4	Good, but room for improvement	LoveisintheStars
2016-08-03 20:20:27	This is quickly becoming one of my favoite podcasts.  They have the guts to talk about things so many of us tip toe around.	5	Great podcast	Jifflefly
2016-08-03 12:11:51	Code Switch takes on the nuanced aspects of conversations on race that other media doesn't. What is objectivity in reporting? How do people talk with their family members about current social movements? This podcast has challenged me to think critically about some of the underlying issues that inform the way we discuss race in the US.	5	Covers Difficult Topics in Approachable Way	Ashlitas F.
2016-08-03 18:34:45	The first couple episodes tried very well to delve into complicated subjects. Has since went down hill. We get it vote democrat, trumps a racist, and there are inequalities. Why not discuss the issues and how people have solved these issues on a smaller level perhaps. But seriously this show went to crap.	2	Came out great, burnt out fast	BackcountryCam
2016-08-03 12:07:51	The hosts are very professional and the segments always have great guests. It's short so it never drags and the podcasts leave me feeling better about whatever racial issue they're covering.	5	A nice discussion on real issues.	Yosoyleche

2016-07-25 18:02:56	This is my favorite podcast. I listen to each and every episode - and I'm so happy when I see that I have a new one waiting! The topics are on point. Yes, they may push boundaries of race, history and context in America but the subjects are explored in such a way that makes you think and feel something.  Seek understanding or do your own research but it's always interesting and thought provoking. Never dumbed down or boring! This is food for thought. Please keep the episodes coming!	5	Insightful Podcast!	KoryJaxn
2016-07-20 20:29:03	I wondered what kind of podcasts this would present and was pleasantly and surprisingly engaged by the show. I watched the one on OJ and the more recent podcast on Philando Castile which was a simple presentation of his history with police stops. Measured and thoughtful. sometimes challenging. Keep them coming.	5	Interesting take on America	DarthEvil7289
2016-07-21 00:13:02	It's great that this podcast started out with the whiteness episode because it came out strong with what we will see to come from this podcast. I enjoyed that episode and every episode afterwards. Constructive criticism: the direction of the show is confusing as each episode has a different staging from the prior. It needs to keep a somewhat consistent pattern, like popular NPR shows like Invisibilia, TAL, Planet Money, Hidden Brain, etc. Other then that, they talk about the issues that I want to know about, especially recent news which is informative but feeds the emotional need. Please don't let these haters on the reviews sway your opinion of this great podcast. They are just white people (maybe even just mentally) that haven't realized that not everyone is white - says a white millennial woman.	4	Telling reviews on here	peinkypanna
2016-07-20 19:31:15	I love the point of view of this podcast. I have started looking forward to it every week. The episodes following the Philando Castile and Alton Sterling murders were especially healing and cathartic.	5	Great addition to political podcast landscape	Cmtlang
2016-07-20 17:48:59	Finally! I am so happy that this podcast finally exists! It is absolutely amazing, I can't recommend it enough.	5	The best!	Annietheknitter
2016-07-16 18:00:06	Refreshingly empathic journalism bringing thoughtful analysis with a dynamic and diversified team of young professionals.

2016-07-18 17:11:43	"I wish this were a regular NPR show instead of just a podcast. My guess is that older, white listeners would defund NPR if it were on the air. 

They do a great job of dissecting how race works in America in ways that are often common sense to race scholars yet I have not been divulgated to most Americans. I am glad that it is finally available in more than just one minute segments on NPR. Understanding race is especially needed in the time and the age that we are in now. Many whites are uncomfortable with acknowledging they are the beneficiaries of a US apartheid system. That is to be expected. It is still good for us to understand the world, even if we don't agree or like it. That is true for both POC and white people alike. This podcast does a good job of helping us to understand the world that we live in.

That said, they are neglectful of actually looking at or talking to empirical work on the topics that they discuss. There is a lot of work already done on the topics that they cover and for some reason, they don't use any of it. They could use statistics or speak to social scientists who actually study a lot of the things that they are talking about. Instead, they rely on ""history"" to make a claim. What about contemporary work on race? They tend to ignore that."	4	Great show, much needed, needs work	Chin Kim

2016-07-15 14:26:50	As a young white man who came from a very white household and had all white friends it was a shock when I first went to college and finally began to become close to people of lots of different races. By the end of school though my best friends were Indian and black, and my girlfriend was Hispanic. I learned so much in conversations with them that I never understood before. This podcast is another fantastic way to expand your perspective. It challenges me to think more about how I act and what I say and informs me more about aspects of race I never understood.

2016-07-15 02:36:36	"otherwise, the marketing for this podcast is totally misleading..It's basically like NPR made a podcast to show white people what it's like to have every race represented except your own, delivering content & opinions from their personal views/perspective on what you think, believe or do. experts on white people &  the bias and mishaps they cause.. This isn't a bad thing, I just think it's better to not mislead in the description & own it. people will listen no matter what because it's an NPR podcast, but i just wanted to comment because while I don't disagree with the views represented, I think they had a platform to engage a broader audience & establish a more ""balanced"", realistic  dialogue focused on making progress & missed that opportunity.."	2	2 stars because it's NPR & well produced	Ehodges05

2016-07-11 04:30:02	"From what I know, every physical body has color regardless of race.  Here are some questions I would like to ask the journalists of this podcast.  Can you tell what are the different races of the human soul?  And if we have souls and there is a creator as in God who created us, does God then identify us according to race?  I say that if the creator sees me for who I am then why should I not see myself or others that way?

I know that there is more to my existence than the illusionary part of myself, i.e. my body.  I am spirit with a body, not a body with a spirit.  Race is a made up identity based on the physical body - it is an attachment to something that the mind clings too.  Race only matters when we place emphasis on it, i.e. when our minds our attached to the idea.  If we want to be free of racism then we, as in all humans, need to first be free of this attachment of so called ""race"" and the level of such freedom achieved will be in direct proportion to our freedom from the attachment to our illusionary selves."	1	We are all colored, but does it matter?

2016-07-10 18:47:22	"It's taking a moment for this podcast to find its feet--understandably so, it only just began. A few episodes have had little to add to the conversation about race in the US, others have been interesting but still mostly regurgitating ideas that can be easily found elsewhere. 

The extra this week, however, was the best episode by far. In addressing the shootings of this last week they found their voice. If they are able to maintain that level of rawness and vulnerability while discussing race...this podcast could be a game changer."	5	Possible game changer	l.Ellison

I am a White non-Latino person who is eager to hear about the different perspectives that are part of our diverse American community.  I have listened to all the episodes so far and don't feel that they are ""making White people feel bad"" (like another review said).  I feel like I am a fly on a wall where really smart people of color are talking about current events and pop culture and mixing those current events with historical events and their personal experience.  Keep up the good work!"	5	Fly on the Wall	Maestra Wilson

2016-07-04 18:53:58	For me, this podcast is still trying to find its footing. Focus on those untold stories such as the one on Margaret Cho's breakout show for Asian Americans. As a black women, the similarity in experiences of seeing people like yourself, you forget that it exists for other races as well. Those or the type of stories that will help to unite listeners. OJ Made in America was a unique story as well, because of my age I didn't realize that he had manufactured his image in that manner. Thanks and I look forward to your continued growth and success.	3	Not Quite Their Yet	Nita.B.Brown
2016-07-03 18:57:19	I enjoy listening to podcasts where I am not the target audience. Podcasts that speak to life experiences I don't know and never will in a first person sense. It helps me better understand the world around me and gives important context to US events. This podcast is part of my effort to know more and I hope they continue to navigate what is a task.	5	Interesting & varied	KatieM&$6
2016-07-03 23:18:54	As a white person, I have found this podcast interesting because it helps me to see how other parts of the country might be percieving me. I am a white male and I am better able to see my privledge with help from shows like this. I do wish the show also had a white voice to help give their perspecctive as well, though. Without that, the show feels less like an educational program and more like a protesting one. Let's find solutions together.	4	White people might not like it but they should listen anyway.	DougSarver
2016-06-30 18:36:09	Actual listener here. I appreciate your approach with the first episode on whiteness. I first heard of the host on Another Round so I knew he would be great! Thank you for covering some Asian-American issues, I'd like more on the model minority myth. Especially since a lot of times AA like to keep their head down on issues of race and racism.	5	Great start, don't mind the trolls.	Cichor
2016-07-02 20:20:00	"At the time of this review, there are 6 episodes out and I've listened to them all. This podcast does s great job of raising questions, but falls short of answering them. However, I do think that this show is a step in the right direction for representing people of color on public radio.

If you are white, don't take this show as an attack. These are conversations that do need to happen and are in no way trying to paint all whites as evil monsters."	4	Doesn't finish well	Sleevesmcfly
2016-07-01 21:08:50	I see this more in the realm of an intelligent discussion about culture - and pop cultuer - with a focus on the ways we categorize ourselves and others. Still early to tell how this will endure. BTW, I'm a white guy and never felt targeted or unfairly represented in any of the episodes.	3	Interesting cultural journalism	westontt
2016-07-01 13:54:47	The topic is interesting and the production quality is high but the content is weak.  Simplistic views of large groups of people based on their skin color neither elucidates nor gives us a path forward to make the world a better place.  If the call for social justice consists primarily of feeling guilty for being born with a certain color skin don't expect it to be answered by many.	2	Reductive and tired examination	Mechblue

2016-07-01 04:26:37	Wow there is a lot of anger on here that is completely uncalled for. This podcast's discussion about whiteness was just that - a discussion. No white-people-bashing at all. But people's anger over this podcast is exactly what the hosts were talking about; It is hard to talk about the American white identity because people don't have the tools to do it. We as a country have never learned how. People either ignore it or get really defensive. Anyways, the podcast discusses interesting topics in a casual tone. I found that it sparked discussions in my own life...and, yes, it made me think about my own white identity...but I wasn't angry about it.	4	Interesting topics	Lfreeman00

I don't know if they've quite hit they're stride, but it's early yet. And yes, people will get very wadded up over this stuff, big deal- keep going!	4	Thought provoking, hasn't quite found its voice.	Teddyboyforever
2016-06-29 17:07:42	The fact that so many people aren't comfortable listen to a podcast like this is exactly why you wanted to continue to do it. Thank you for bringing on multiple people to discuss their experiences in relation to personal history and current politics. I will continue to listen so that I stay open to other perspectives and experiences different from my own.	5	A lot of the reviews are why we need a podcast like this	Laurita B.
2016-06-29 14:52:10	I have been waiting for this for so long. White people who are sad and hurt, don't be. It's not designed to make you feel guilty. Race is just a reality for many of us. And we need space to think and discuss about it.	5	Amazing	Another person here
2016-06-29 00:10:08	People saying this is racist or giving it 1 star, you guys have a lot to unpack about racism obviously (as do we all).

2016-06-27 22:42:15	Smart, well-produced conversations on important topics with great interviewees. I hope that some of the defensive one-star “we're post-racial, stop trying to make me feel guilty for being white” reviewers will stick with the show and see how much we can learn.

2016-06-27 20:12:22	"First I would like to start by saying the podcast has little content, and no storytelling.  And while I enjoy their topic and feel they made some valid points they seem to focus solely on faults/differences of white people.  Making it feel less of an attempt for racial equality, more like a rant or even dangerous propaganda. 
Good conversation but directed poorly"	2	Meh	Under20andlistening
2016-06-27 15:21:03	Very disappointed, this podcast is racist again whites people. A bunch of non white people talking about what it's like to be white. Saying non whites don't go to national parks, obviously you have never been to Yellowstone!!!	1	Racist	Singram9988
2016-06-27 14:13:44	"I'm sick of these ""discussions"" on race and ""whiteness"" that are one-sided. That's a lecture not a discussion. Don't tell me what I think-ask me what I think."	1	Horribly racist	JTaaa

2016-06-25 05:22:20	Thoughtful, interesting and sagacious dialogue on race in mainstream that has come at an optimal time.

2016-06-24 03:23:52	As a white woman, I really enjoy this podcast. It is really interesting for me to hear issues explored that sometimes I have never considered.

2016-06-23 15:34:28	I never write reviews, but after reading through a bunch of negative ones felt compelled to urge everyone to listen to this podcast yourself before making a decision. As an academic, I think this podcast is extraordinarily well done: open-minded, constructive, thorough, and respectful. As a human being, I think this podcast adds an essential element to the contemporary conversation surrounding racial, ethnic, sexual, gendered, and religious equality and mutual understanding. The discourse of whiteness is a fascinating and complex one, and this podcast is a stimulating means of exhorting us to question our underlying assumptions and unconscious biases.	5	A Must Listen!

Guess what - there is a lot of pervasive racism in this country that white people never even see. That doesn't mean it isn't real or isn't having an impact on people's lives - it means it's way past time to pay attention. I really enjoy this show - I'm learning a great deal in an approachable, conversational style. Keep it coming, Code Switch.	4	This is an important conversation...	AMCinDMV

2016-06-22 07:05:40	Race is uncomfortable to talk about. These discussions are respectful, approachable and give appropriate steps for action. The panel is diverse and so are the topics. It's not in depth on many topics, which I'm sure annoys people with more advanced understanding. But I would point people here for a good starting point for racial conversations. The basics are hard to get right and I think this podcast does an excellent job.	5	Good beginner conversations	u3drive

2016-06-22 03:29:39	"Content from NPR has been getting worse for a few years now but this sets a new low. Code Switch examines race in America with with such a microscope that the podcast could be passed off as a parody of NPR. Was told it would make me laugh, and it would make me think critically about race. Didn't expect it go have me laugh at their critical thinking on race.

Listened to just one episode and heard that blacks don't like hiking because of slavery and that 'no Jean shorts' allowed at pools is racist. Not sure where they pulled those theories from but the complete lack of data to back up such claims was baffling. Instead of going straight to the slavery card you could have looked at if lack of hiking interest from blacks was possibly driven by the large proportion of blacks who live in urban areas, and compared their park participation to those of other races who live in major urban areas. But that would require - you know - actual research and effort."	1	Oh god this podcast	Youcandobetterbuzzfeed223

Looking forward to seeing how this podcast develops."	5	Promising but awkward	Roachie D.
2016-06-20 14:24:54	Awful show. They are trying to find racism or connection where there is not. They need to do their research right and come with an unbiased point of view	1	Awful waste of time.	Khanal13
2016-06-19 13:15:37	"I have been waiting for this for years! A dedicated space for the amazing Code Switch team to explore race, culture, politics and the intersectionality of modern American life. Yes, whiteness should be discussed explicitly. Yes, as a young white lady, I needed to hear the different impact that Muhammad Ali had in communities of color. And yes, raising up queer voices of color is essential for understanding and healing after Orlando.
A brief reminder: At the center of sharing experiences or lifting voices, is a subjectivity that not resonate ever time. However, those stories DO resonate with many, many folks - and that's the point of acknowledging the act of Code Switching. Lift the veil and listen for yourself!"	5	Yes, please	Pnwfan
2016-06-18 18:54:59	I am really surprised by the negative reviews. This is insightful, provocative, important stuff. I think they are doing a great job and I am hungry for more episodes.	5	One of my favorite new podcasts	Tifa6513
2016-06-19 06:59:14	Are you white? Do you hate yourself? Are you perpetually apologizing for being born white? You should be. If you're not always apologizing for the great privilege of being born white, you're a horrible person. It is impossible to care about racism while white without feeling ashamed of the great shame of being born white. Never mind that you have absolutely no control over being born white. Apologize, you're an oppressor. Do NOT, whatever you do, say that a person of color talking about your whiteness might be wrong. You cannot talk about people of color, but you better be open to listening to their life stories. Ugh. Get out of here. Such dishonest discourse.	1	White people are the worst.	eandonova
2016-06-19 05:29:49	"I get what these people are trying to do, and I understand that they have the best intentions, but it seems like they are mired down in acceptable language and popular (mostly) leftist ideas. 

They are wholly unable to have a frank and truthful conversation about race. They delude themselves by thinking that this is in any way going outside of an echo chamber. 

If you want to see these types of discussions done better and with more meaningful exchanges of views and ideas, check out any episode of Race Wars with Sherrod Small, Kurt Metzger, and the rest of the gang."	2	Well, it was a good try...	Ed Hominem
2016-06-18 12:36:20	Great show!	5	Great show	Bearfkr
2016-06-18 04:14:47	"I have  mixed feelings towards this show.  I think the topics are important but I haven't found the insights particularly engaging or original.  Granted, I'm in an an academic community, so these concepts are pretty well-trod.  On the other hand, if this show is trying to communicate to people other than people ""like me"" (e.g., progressive NPR-ites), it seems that they are failing based on the reviews on this page.  There is a great chasm in this country between two PC mainstreams: the race-aware, race-sensitive and the ostensible ""color blind"" majority.  This show does nothing to bridge that chasm, but only to highlight it.  I think other shows have dealth with this subject matter in a way that provokes less instinctually defensive reactions, which is maybe the key to attracting and keeping listeners?

That said, some of the reviews on this page are totally off base.  If this show embraces some kind of double standard, it's because that standard is a necessary response to the double standard that exists in our society at large."	3	Important but without focus	krs617
2016-06-17 13:30:56	This podcast has the ingredients necessary to produce a home run.  Unfortunately it is hosted by unsophisticated millennials who either lack appropriate life experience or are being filtered by a politically correct NPR corporation.  I will soon unsubscribe if they do not dig into more juicy content.	1	Great potential, lacking execution.	brx12345
2016-06-17 12:43:01	"Yet another NPR outlet for shallow liberal ideas. The underlying theme is ""if you are white, you just don't get it"". 
I like the concept of the show, but was disappointed with the lack of intellectual rigor. The content is something you'd find at Oberlin or Sarah Lawrence. 
Perhaps they should consider Thomas Sowell's comment:
""The word racism is like ketchup. It can be put on practically anything - and demanding evidence makes you a racist""."	1	Whites need not apply	Eric the Stoic
2016-06-17 02:18:14	Actually a pretty interesting listen - it took them forever to actually start up the podcasts. Sadly lots of negative reviewers for a podcast about non-whites talking about race…not surprised to see that when white identity is starting to be a conscious thing as the minority share of the country increases and pushes whiteness, eventually, into one of many types of people rather than the absolute clear majority. Keep going on and improving! I doubt most of the negative reviewers really listened to this all that much for an honest review.	5	Interesting	Marked Twain
2016-06-16 18:58:04	I learn a lot from this podcast and enjoy listening to it. The first podcast about whiteness was thought-provoking and pushed me beyond my current understanding of the topic. I'm partway through the podcast about the Orlando shooting. The attack is tragic along so many dimensions. In the media to which I am exposed, the fact that most of the victims were Latino has been mentioned but almost as if in passing. This has been one more level of pain on top of so many others. I appreciate you highlighting this aspect of the tragedy and helping me understand more about it. Thank you.	5	Good podcast	SooBooBooSoo

2016-06-16 05:27:43	I'm surprised, though I shouldn't be, at the negative reviews. I think this Podcast is wonderful in that it talks about race unapologetically and about many different groups. Yes, I know most people don't want to talk about race. We were taught not to. But we NEED to which makes this podcast very timely and important. Don't be behind the curve by avoiding talk about race or worse- demonizing it.	5	Push through your discomfort	Team Izzo
2016-06-16 11:45:37	"Whenever NPR debuts a new podcast, I at least listen to the first few episodes.  With so many quality shows out there, there just isn't enough time in my day for this one.  Some of the hosts speak so quickly it is hard to follow.  The topics come across as opinionated rants rather than well-researched point of views.  I also find it quite disappointing to hear race addressed with such clunky stereotypes in a podcast that is supposedly an intellectual conversation.  For me it is borderline comical that the phrase ""persons of color"" is en vogue in public discourse as if ""white"" somehow presupposes some absence of any color.  I also think it is lame that the term ""brown"" is being used in this podcast for all non-black minorities.  It would never have dawned on me to label Koreans as ""brown"" and to think that minorities don't like the outdoors until this podcast put those ideas in my mind.  I will be unsubscribing from this one."	1	Not worth the time	Reverend Prof
2016-06-15 22:55:54	I'm white and I love this podcast. Be open minded and accept that talking about race can be uncomfortable but that's what this podcast is about. It takes a lot of discomfort and courage to look deep into your life and the system you live in to see the balance of power and privilege. Give it a chance.	5	AMAZING	Girl on a budget
2016-06-15 22:17:32	The first podcast I've heard that addresses the topics of their podcasts with a critical lens, taking white privilege into account. A great podcast to listen to if you want to challenge yourself and broaden your tool box.	5	Great Courageous Conversations	NetflixUser827364
2016-06-14 20:11:36	I don't know why other reviews are being so harsh. I'm white and enjoy hearing from people of color about things I may not have otherwise thought about. It's a well produced podcast from NPR. I've really liked the 2 episodes I've heard so far. Great job!	5	Interesting	Funny & Addicting
2016-06-15 15:37:03	It may be unfair to compare it to a show like Embedded or Invisibilia - wonder how the budget of this show compares to other shows NPR has rolled out lately. I really hope this show gets plenty of attention from NPR and continues to improve.	3	Pretty good so far!	Blirwin
2016-06-14 15:01:19	I am glad to hear this conversation going on. It is in our discomfort that we advance a discussion that has been LONG overdue. Race, racism, whiteness, Latinos, language, merit and privilege are things that as ethnic minorities and majorities we do not come to grips with in any meaningful way. I will say that I hope that they can refine their messages a little better but it's an important start and we should all be able to acknowledge that we are more ready to fall into our stereotypes and assumptions instead of constructive and difficult debates.	5	Happy to listen to it	elshaman
2016-06-13 23:24:05	"Anyone who dares to talk about race, identity politics, social issues, and the like had better be ready to hear a lot of criticisms, coherent and otherwise. For example, anyone laying claim to a fraction of a definition of blackness will catch flak from others for whom the experience of blackness (or whiteness/non-blackness) differs. Codeswitch dares to talk about these issues. No one's ever going to ""get it right"" because the words that comprise much of the subject refer to wildly different experiences among the listeners.

That's why this program gets 5 stars from me. The ""goal"" of perfect representation is impossible. I'm Caucasian. I don't have many close black friends. So I immensely appreciate hearing the panelists discuss their impressions of racial issues, social issues, their personal experiences relating to being people of color. Maybe another podcast could do it better, but I haven't found any. The negative reviews I've read fail to suggest any. Most of the fragile responses imply they haven't listened to the first episode. Please don't stop making this show. Get more perspectives. Develop it. It's important."	5	Imperfect but essential	Mose__

2016-06-10 23:56:27	CodeSwitch proves itself right with the vitriol in these reviews. It's mostly white people griping about a dissection of white people—proving that you're uncomfortable having these conversations and proving that CodeSwitch and open discussions about race matter and should be had.

2016-06-10 22:09:15	"NPR is seen is the bastion of progression, and it's no surprise there are people angry that there's a conversation that attempts to be more inclusive. I love code switch; I love the conversations. I'm learning and listening and enjoying this podcast. There 1 star reviews are a constant reminder of how unnervingly common and acceptable being closed minded is. I've yet to hear anything ""racist"" or prejudiced (which is actually the term to use) in this podcast."	5	Surprise! White people hate when they're not the center of the conversation	YoYemiO
2016-06-09 14:48:32	"I just listened to the “Made for You and Me” episode.  It was amazing!  I am a brown person who loves the outdoors and I can relate so much to the experiences of the people described on the show.  I was so glad that this episode presented our country’s history of exclusionary laws in a clear manner and tied them to usage of outdoor spaces by people of color.  Jim Crow laws, housing restrictions and the numerous other exclusionary practices that endured well into the 20th century are areas that deserve journalistic exploration.  It is my sincere hope that topics like this will be better understood in the future.  Airing quality shows like this that tie current topics with their historical context can only accelerate understanding.  I, for one, was inspired by this episode.
The Spanish language version of the song “Made for You and Me” just drove home the point that we must think of our public land as places for all people to enjoy."	5	Made For You and Me	Friar Francis

2016-06-10 19:28:03	"I really wanted to be able to say that the NPR-haters, political wingnuts, and white folks who can't stand a story that doesn't end with them being god's gift to the planet are all wrong about this podcast and are just looking for something to dislike.  But . . . that first episode was really not very good.  

I'm a 30-something black woman and I found just about everyone and their contribution to the conversation annoying.  The premise (whitness as a cultural identity and why we don't talk about it as such) was interesting, but the producers didn't do much with it.  No historical or political context was provided, and the very little social context that was provided was so incoherently expressed as to be virtually useless.  And then they interview a college student!  It was so painful listening to the young man try to talk about race that I had to turn it off.  This is mean and I'm sure college students have great and valid ideas about the world (I used to be one!), but listening to ANY college student talk about issues like this or politics in general is like listening to cat's nails on a blackboard.  NEXT! 

But, I'm hoping things get better over time since I had the good fortune to listen to the second episode first, which was an improvement over the first."	3	Growing Pains . . . ?	jspeyton
2016-06-10 14:06:47	Poorly executed. Hosts offer superficial perceptions and commentary on the complex issues of race. I listened to the episode about whiteness and I can say for certain that I will not be tuning back in.	1	Not a fan	Arezee89
2016-06-10 13:46:40	Would give tremendous perspective on being a white ally, understanding white privilege and how to make actionable changes towards abolishing institutionalized racism.	1	Should have Tim Wise as a guest or host	BKbrah17
2016-06-10 07:23:59	"I'm a white male and I was pretty excited to listen to this podcast to learn about my race and others and how it impacts society and the culture behind it. I never thought I see it be so well put to not be ""racist"" like they are just disgusting and find certain things interesting and compare each other's thoughts. 

For example the first episode called whiteness the hosts pointed out how ""whites"" really never think about they're race at all while the other races living in NA think about they're race daily. It's interesting to think about. 

So it's interesting to discover the way other races or cultures think and do certain things that is different from my own. It's a great step in the right direction in helping each other put us in different shoes."	4	Race is a hard topic!	Mattatakiss
2016-06-09 22:48:27	The presenters are manic and need to slow down. Their voices gave me anxiety. The substance is not there yet. Unless the show changes drastically, I won't be listening.	1	Don't bother...	DannyP1224568
2016-06-09 17:27:33	"Was an interesting idea for a podcast... Until episode 2. I feel many of their tangents and inputs are quite out of the scope of what the main theme could be focused on. ""You can't play soccer so you are racist against Latinos"" but that would also mean no cricket, no football, no frisbee, no GAA, etc...?"	2	Was a fan until Ep 2	aspen856
2016-06-09 04:14:26	So far I love it. I'm so glad NPR is tackling these issues that many of us have experienced our whole lives in a smart, approachable way. I only wish this podcast existed while I was growing up.	5	Awesome	kzhang88
2016-06-08 13:59:27	I thought this podcast was really interesting and touched on a topic that really needs to be discussed but usually is not. They took a tricky subject and were able to explore it in an honest way. As a white person this podcast made me uncomfortable at times, but thats a GOOD thing. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people who can't embrace that uncomfortableness. This dilemma is exactly what this podcast touches on and it's so important to explore. It's really interesting how the topic of this podcast is exemplified so well in the reviews section.	5	Comments Exemplify Topic of Podcast	sss320sss320

2016-06-07 23:45:18	"Not surprising that college professors would talk about whiteness.  Why is their no discussion of why ""white"" is the only box you can click at schools, colleges or the federal government. Instead of your ethnic background like German American. You like the divide to be continued. You are not unbiased when you teach. Why not teach a class on how to value all our backgrounds and work together instead of continually hammering the same drums and dividing us further."	1	Cliche	Dwight Kurt Shrute 1
2016-06-07 17:10:04	"So, listening to two people of color tell you what it's like to be white, is exactly as un-entertaining as it sounds. As someone who is half Japanese but is ""lucky enough"" to be considered white by the general population, this show so far is ridiculous. The article they continue to reference, ""Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack"" is not current enough to use as a reference in a research paper today, yet it is a cornerstone in this podcast. The authors of this show must think that all white people have yachts and summer homes in wine country, because all of the white privilege indicators seem to line up with the lives of politicians' sons. Do yourself a favor and just Google ""stuff white people like"", it's funnier and less nauseating."	1	Whiteness? Ok sure.	ElizaGrass

2016-06-07 11:29:43	"Was not ready for the conversation. These reviews look like trashy YouTube comments. As a ""woke"" white man and former diaspora studies student, this is a good crash course into understanding whiteness through a lens that isn't mine. All this negativity is from people who still don't understand this concept, so please consider listening before you decide. If you can't handle ""the invisible knapsack,"" then you all won't handle what's to come."	5	Everyone who panned this...	Hellawont
2016-06-07 00:56:19	"NPR's new show where journalists of color talk about race is divisive and split between 1 and 5 star reviews! WHO WOULDA THOUGHT!

Just listen to it. Whether you're white or not, you owe it to YOURSELF to hear these viewpoints. It will help you think more deeply about race and culture (and politics!) in 2016. 

LISTEN TO IT. Rate it and think about it whatever you want, but please listen."	5	Oh hey lookit that	izi_sbk
2016-06-07 02:21:29	I was open to this and came into the first episode willing to learn (disclosure: I'm a white male). They touched very few issues of whiteness and when they did only discussed them briefly. The entire episode was them talking about TALKING ABOUT whiteness and how difficult it can be to those who are white. Okay I'm ready, can you please talk about it now rather than dance around the subject for 35 mins? My only take away from the first episode was that white people have a hard time talking about whiteness; but apparently, so do these hosts.	2	Let's talk about talking about race	Thecreamofsumyoungguy
2016-06-06 14:58:18	So glad you all are having this conversation. And that is the way I listened to the podcast, as a conversation. There are no simple answers but there is so much to talk about and discover about ourselves no matter what our race. Please ignore the unhelpful negative comments and keep going.	5	LOVE IT!!!	ERAY Comstock
2016-06-06 12:51:40	Just listened to the first episode and it exceeded my expectations.  Those two professors you ad on the first ep ruled.  Keep it up with the really interesting stuff, guys!  I want to hear all about and from Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, John McWhorter, and all the other writers you mentioned, too. I want to hear about navigating the world as a black woman vs. a white woman.  I want to hear about President Obama's code switching modes of speech.

2016-06-06 05:38:21	A poor attempt to instill guilt in white people.

2016-06-06 01:22:46	I have only listened to the first episode so far, and I thought it was well thought out and made some great points. The transition to the ads was a bit awkward, but I am sure as they do more that will get better.	4	Great start	secoles
2016-06-05 15:29:01	"I've read the negative reviews and come on, it's the first show.  Isn't it  intended to be an informal conversation?  And it's one that we really need. White privilege is hard to see when you're white and surrounded by it and you take it for granted. I think the hosts did a very good job defining this. If you want more fire and anger (as justified as this is), this probably isn't the conversation for you. If you want a reasonable discussion and the ""conversation about race"", here you go.  I'm so glad it's here."	5	We need this conversation	Chnvaldez
2016-06-06 01:17:00	"""Whiteness"". So, they're going to talk about culture and self identity right? Wrong! Even if you're all about white guilt and privilege, you will probably be disappointed. It was that bad."	1	Fail	Fezziksrock
2016-06-05 22:45:44	I got my degree is secondary education and one of the required classes was a class about race, it was taught by a black lesbian woman to a mostly white college. Everyone warned me that I would hate this class!! They would say that the professor had a huge agenda. She really didn't, she was just trying to get us to think about race and how it affected our teaching practices. She started by having us talk about our own culture and what that meant. All of us white kids did not even think we had a culture!! Seriously white people spend a lot of time pretending not to notice race, and pretending not have biases but we all have them! As a teacher I need to be self aware if I don't want to continue the pattern of ignoring race and not actively trying to sort out the biases that I have and fighting against them.	4	Race at a white university	barbieK14

I expected the propaganda, I expected to be talked down upon, to be told every race has the right and is expected to be proud except for us evil white folk. Got it. That's why I listen. It entertains me.

That's where this podcast left me. It's not funny, not enlightening to rational ideas. Just a bunch of elitists spewing the usual in a terribly dry way.

I can refute many of the ""experiences"" they say whites have/don't have. If I were to address my personal experiences and those of family and friends in regard to being white, this post would be too long to read.  As goes with race and the double standards skewed against whites, I am constantly reminded I cannot know their struggles because I am not their race. However, I'd like to point out, non-whites cannot dictate to me, my struggles because they are not my race. Why does no one ever address this?"	1	First episode	Mozlvr

2016-06-04 02:37:35	I liked the first episode -- I'm looking forward to hearing the crew come up with more thought provoking takes on race (perhaps beyond the academic, critical studies approach).  And one thing -- I can tell Gene Demby is a really smart guy, but he talks waaaaayy too fast.  I found myself missing things he was saying at times.  Maybe slow down a little?

2016-06-03 22:53:19	That wow is on multiple levels. First wow for all the way harsh reviews. The first episode wasn't by any means perfect, but I liked that they chose an uncomfortable subject and spoke to a variety of individuals. Race is never easy to talk about, but I liked the approach they took to open the door to future conversations. You can't talk about everything in one podcast so I would expect that future episodes would tackle some of the things others thought were missing. I really enjoyed listening to this and it made me really think about privilege I experienced based on my own ethnicity and race identity. I look forward to the next conversation and am excited to see how this show evolves.	3	Wow	Mehvash

2016-06-02 15:13:37	"Enjoyed the first episode. Looking forward to what's to come. The negative reviews are not surprising given the topic and given that people have difficulty discussing race. Also, it seems as if people are judging before listening. For example the review mentioning no ""Anglo"" voice when one of the professors was a white woman. I would encourage people to listen all the way through and if you feel angry or uncomfortable challenge yourself to think about why. We have deep racial issues in this country as evidenced most recently by the rise in hate crimes and Donald Trump. I am glad this podcast is creating a dialogue."	5	Enjoyed the first episode	actfilm
2016-06-02 15:09:44	Learned nothing from listening to this except for the fact that white people feel awkward about talking about being white.  And, most of the 5 star reviews were given before the podcast even came out which should not happen.	1	Awful	EricFig
2016-06-02 15:07:06	"The token white guys: an academic who earns his bucks explaining why white people are ignorant (but at the same time calling that ignorance stupidity); and a brain-washed white kid. Hey team, I don't want to embarrass you, but...your bias is showing! Of course, this is NPR. 

I will leave you with this: the hosts talk about opening up white people's world view. But what they are actually discussing is white American's view of their (and other's place in America. I am pretty sure that white people don't run China, Kenya, or Mexico...or do they?! Our savvy professor doesn't think whiteness should be limited to an idea of skin color. So if you are white, you are part of the problem. If you have certain political and moral views, you are ALSO white, regardless of 'race' or ethnicity. And don't forget, it is very, very, embarrassing to be white;probably even not worthy of being part of the conversation."	1	Academia is the only opinion that counts	josuecarolina

2016-06-01 22:56:23	"But then my expectations were kind of low. At least for the first show. I expect that this isn't the show for me because I am black and pretty jaded when it comes to efforts like this. I know that it is hard for white people to talk about being white, unless they are virulent racists, then they can go on about it forever. 

I didn't care to have statments they were making qualified so many times before they made the statement. At the end of the show, I don't feel like I was able to take anything away from it. I imagine that there are people who are able to take something away from this effort, and I am kinda sure that they are mostly white people. 

I am going to try and listen to a few more shows, despite the annoyance I find in the sound of their voices. If they read these reviews, I want them to know I am not some gung-ho, hotep type or someone who is hyperblack or anti-white. I'm not. I know it is a struggle to even recognize racial issues, and twice that to talk about them. I accept that it is some line to walk to not offend listeners as you try to put ideas out there that may challenge the way they see or don't see the world.

Go and talk to people at NPR who have pretty much done their work and continue to do so,like Brook Gladstone at WNYC or even Terry Gross of WHYY."	2	Meh...	WisdomSeed

If they find it so hard to talk about a certain subject, maybe it's because they aren't very ""woke"" (to use their term) and have no idea what to say that might be insightful or true. So much arrogance and academic hubris, so little intelligent discussion.

All of the bias presented just goes to show how now much of a stumbling block and hindrance one's own race can be. Own it, be proud of who you are, but by no means make others feel guilty about their own racial makeup. 

As with anything else, if your sole identity as a person becomes your race, you will never be truly satisfied in life.

2016-05-13 01:12:51	Okay I heard the trailer & it sounds like the program has great potential HOWEVER why is no Anglo voice also included? Shouldn't this voice be included to see how this large group reacts to the revelations of the other ethnic groups or is the white voice not wanted? This suggests to me the POSSIBILITY that the program can lapse into a discussion of 'political correctness' & 'microaggresion'. I shall try to listen with an open mind without superimposing my personal biases. I will review again after a few shows. I'm looking forward to learning.	3	Segregation	G_dforsaken
