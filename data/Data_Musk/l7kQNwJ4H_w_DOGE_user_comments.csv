"Thank you for sharing your life with me Elon.  Our lives are so different but still feel we have become friends.  Just met a man who will take Tesla and me to the vet after I tried to cancel his appointment and the woman at the vets called me back and gave me his number.  Just called him and told him the vet gave me his number because someone in office had his information and thought he could help me.  After we chatted and he agreed to get me there on Monday, July 7th by 8:30am, I had to call vet then we could talk a bit.  I confirmed date with vet and called Rick back.  He retired from army, lives on West side of Kingsport, I'm  on the East side, and is single with 2 aged cats and 2 dogs, one is older and he took in a puppy after his other older dog passed a year ago.  Tesla needs some friends to get him moving.  He would do well with the puppy, and would be kind to the old ones.  Now I'm  anxious to finish your video and learn wh e re your son is.

"Both Elon and Trump got the gullible and naive, oh so happy to see them ""fall apart"" losers exactly where they want them to be right now - assured and celebrating their ""victory"" (in reality they did nothing, Trump and Elon did, would;n; that itself be telling and suspicious s to anyone with a little bit of brain).. 
nope, Dems jumped right away in joy, as expected... they lost that privilege called the right-to-use some common sense, have some backbone and the brain to use - long time ago, when evil took over).

How many times have I seen these sore losers loving the evil ways to achieve their insidious goals through lies, accusations etc... like the eyes of that crazy Clinton witch right before she lost that election, scared me.. for real.. 

Only to result in Trump getting bigger and stronger... this is because most REAL Americans are no dummies and have not been for a while now... 

Dems would want them to be and still believe they are, which shows their true faces AND CONTEMPT FOR THE MINORITIES THEY CLAIM TO BE HELPING AND ""ON THEIR SIDE"" WHILE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE all along.. 
Of course, the ""minorities"" growing up in the ghettos for decades in all these Dem ran cities, are street smart, if nothing... 
So they see BS from a mile away and have been sick and tired of it for too long now.. they are now of course, preferring the other side, Dems are killing themselves every timer they open their evil lying mouths..  without even realizing..  the hole gets deeper..Soliciting for votes through cheap subsidies etc..! Shameful...

Obviously, dummies are and have always been the crazy, loud and ""for the people"" bs lefties, while the silent and the wise choose accordingly and get things done. 

Musk and Trump NEVER fell apart, its all part of the show they put up just for shits and gigglez and in which they will of course make BILLIONS in just a a few days,why do you think Tesla shares fell so low... time to buy .. and they are(or will be soon), back up now, and about to go over.. 

Bedsides, why would Elon ""go against"" the president of the country in which his biz is based and expanding, he prefers such a person on his side, strictly biz talking wise, to help his business interests and this is what he does and gets (like the SpaceX city being official, so the launches skip the FAA control and can be done as many times as they desire with no oversight and conditions... ), this is a big deal even if not obvious.. 
Not to mention, on the other end (Trump) you need a guy with rockets (reusable at that)_ on your side. lots of stuff can be put on those, and then tell the bold tough guys on Earth to beware really... 

Ruskies on the other hand would send donkeys for now.. or prisoner drunks as astronauts..
while Chinese can only send what they can steal and copy.. and steal this they will not!
 
Moreover, why would Trump lose Elon, over some ""words  said"" and egos hurt... who takes care of a lot of things Trump now does not have to, bur can focus on other issues.. he needs Elon and similar people of course, who privately develop things for the US Government which would spend ten times as much and ten times as long to achieve.. they always needed each other, and continue to be the case...

On the other end, while sad, its hilarious playing these career politicians aka democrats who NEVER ever did anything to HELP the demos in their titles, nor develop anything useful for the humanity.. but took the money to run themselves and secure their reason to exist aka jobs, instead of fixing the issue they claim they would fix (and never did or do..)",['Omdg'],2025-06-11T14:44:00Z,@skendermakota2381

"Many years ago when I was young, I had a bad case of the stupids. I was far away from God. In early adulthood, some1 was praying for me, because I had a POWERFUL CONVERSION! 
  In the 1990's, I was in a chaplet in Arkansas & (I believed it was The Lord), a voice spoke to me & said, ""Would you agree to quit smoking?"" I said, ""Yes."". Then, after a period of time passed, the same Person asked me if I would agree to be celibate for the rest of my life? I said, ""Yes."" (It's ok. I'll know they're trying to finish me off, when they ask me to give up chocolate. LOL). Anyway, I have been celibate, living as a nun, since the 1990's. I belong to The Lord. So, I don't care if you're the richest, most handsome guy in the world. YOU CAN'T HAVE ME! My riches - & my Husband - are in Heaven. Then I received Prophecies. #1. I will be taken up into Heaven. #2. The President will be assassinated. There are more, but when Pres. Trump was in office back in 2016, I told him, ""As long as I am alive, YOU ARE SAFE.""  But I get frustrated sometimes; Pres. Trump can't stop cursing. Elon can't say, ""Jesus Christ is Lord."" & Thom Homan says he's bringing hell with him.

"Another thing that needs to be DOGED is the presidential library system.  These places are built by private funds but are maintained under the National Park system by taxpayers.  According to the internet,  they cost $100 million per year to maintain. They employ people,  and more jobs are created every year.  The cost to maintain these things goes up a lot every year. 
I suggest that beginning with President #51, the taxpayers no longer support the new libraries. We can continue to support the first 50 as long as they are audited every year and keep costs below a specified level, but NO NEW LIBRARIES  to be taxpayer supported. This is ridiculous.  A new president every 4-8 years. We do not owe them an eternal monument to themselves. They are CEOs of a country,  not gods or monarchs. 
If we start with President #51, and write the legislation now, no person or political party would have to feel singled out or offended.

"At the end of this video where Elon Musk said there are those virtue signaling but have no plan to end the war and the killing. When he asked what was the killing for and his voice raised a bit it was clear his anger about the war. A song from the 70's asked about war. What is it good for...absolutely nothing. Well, it's good for those who make the weapons of war. They make money if there's war. There may be good reasons for some wars but not many.

Their biggest cut was on homeland security, they claimed to have cut 8 billion but it was actually 8 million. And there are many more examples. There are also many example on contracts that are revived, for example the contract cut with the department of veterans affairs.

I believe everything they're saying one thing I do believe the people that don't believe them no matter what you say to them they're not going to change their minds so don't try to change somebody's mind that hates them. someday when DOGE start showing results of what they're doing and the results come back great you're going to start seeing people deny that they hated it at the beginning. it reminds me of Biden when ran for president a lot of people voted for him but when we realized that he's was screwing up the whole country not one of those people in our country admitted that they voted for him nobody wanted to tell anybody that they voted for him but nobody admitted it. I believe I going to be like this with DOGE everybody's going to b**** and moan about what's going on but when the results come back not one person is going to admit that they were against it,[],2025-05-05T17:12:53Z,@robertcampbell5564

"Elon Musk did not succeed in a vacuum. In America, we are inclined to celebrate the heroic individual entrepreneur while ignoring – and even downplaying – that massive public support was the foundation of their success. Consider the iPhone: nearly all of its core technologies, from GPS and touchscreen displays to the internet itself, were publicly funded. Covid vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry, too, have relied heavily on NIH-funded research.

And yet, Musk, Steve Jobs and other tech titans are cast as heroic innovators, while the state is derided as inefficient or meddlesome – even as it continues to underwrite the very innovations that fuel the economy. Further, while the risks of developing these innovations are mitigated by public funding, the profits they create are almost entirely privatized. If American taxpayers had taken equity in Tesla for their $465m investment, it is estimated such a stake would be worth over $300bn today. Instead, it is Musk alone who has enjoyed such wealth.

"I believe cabinet meetings before April 1 were shown here and all were very informative and more cabinet meeting showed and so much information came out, and I really was interested in what everybody was saying however, it was too fast and too much information for me to take in… My suggestion is that you take each head of the committees and one by one review them and ask them what their job has accomplish… that way you can understand better what the cabinets are doing and what their jobs are and how their jobs are going… It may take more time, but it certainly would make it easier for the people to understand… I think ELON Musk‘s way of running a company is how I would like to see this country being run… Stating their job stating what they’re trying to do and stating what they have done, and how long it will be before the rest of it is done… The jobs that they have set up for themselves… so much information at one time is hard to so that is my advice and I don’t think many people would feel differently, but I don’t know. I just know that transparency and accountability is so very important and to understand and figure out what is happening I believe all the cabinets and cabinet members have to slow down and give us time to take it all in… That’s an opinion, but it’s my opinion and I’m not much different than everyone else in the United States.",[],2025-04-20T14:59:11Z,@margobarranti

"My solution for the world.

To save everyone, we need to look at a poor family in a third world coutry. The family have no money. Have everyone around is a blessing. The parents teaches their children everything they know. The parents take care of all the children. The children helps out and learn everything they are taught in order to survive. The more everyone knows helps out the less anyone have to work. Everything is shared. Anything is made or created is share with the rest of the family. You make the best of what you have. 

Now look at everything in our country and see where we go wrong. If we can be like the poor family then life would be much better for everyone. ThIs means get rid of money. Whatever you see will make the poor family life easier and better then we do that for everyone. So make everything free, teach everyone everything we need and want and have everyone produce it. We share resources and don't need to over produce everything. The more everyone know and can do the work the less we have to do the work. Make heaven/paradise on earth and fulfill everyone desire and dream. If you can think of it then lets make it happen.  That is my solution for the world.",[],2025-04-14T05:53:26Z,@ntxhuavlis6757

"Every American should have access to this interview. It provides the background of the DOGE team, their specific expertise, what they are finding and the solutions they offer. One can tell from the conversation they are astute and knowledgeable in their specialty areas and feel strongly about the importance of finishing their work so that the country does not fail. The government has obviously “operated” under absurd antiquated systems that don’t “communicate” with each other which set the stage for massive corruption whether intended or not. Frankly, I am amazed we have made it this long given the circumstances. Kudos to Elon for heading this up and for bringing these very talented team members to overhaul the financial systems of the federal government. The waste is so rampant, you wonder how anything has gotten done in decades. It is simply indescribable. Thank you to Fox for hosting this important group interview to enable Americans to understand the dire need for such a commission. And kudos to Elon who is personally invested in this project because he knows that America cannot continue down the path we have been on any longer. It was the most eye opening interview session I have ever witnessed. Sincere thanks to everyone working on this project. You are to be commended for your devotion and efforts to this massive project.

Here is the frightening thing. You can post this as much as you want but for some reason everyday Americans won’t truly tune in or understand how much good you are trying to do and your people will get get tired of trying to help and give up over time. Please understand that it’s not DOGE’s fault it’s the American people’s fault for not recognizing and realizing what this department is really trying to do. What I’m saying is this country is so dumb because they are used of everything being okay no matter what that they don’t realize what is really going on but I promise you by the time they wake up it will be too late. At that point all the DOGE workers will be long gone because they have wealth they didn’t need to help but they tried and the average ignorant American will suffer severely because they didn’t act or speak up when DOGE tried to inform them.,[],2025-04-07T03:31:33Z,@drakeforet7548

I'm sorry but when I got interviewed for my job which has been my career for 15 years now,I didn't send my dad or mom or buddy into the office to make my case for me. And sorry but Micah parsons is worth more to the cowboys leaving the team then he is staying with the cowboys. He's not the best defensive player in the league he's top 5 at best. He sucks against the run. He's an animal no doubt about it but as a cowboy hell never reach his ceiling because he's breaking the bank just like dak just like ceedee and just like trevon! All of them fold like a paper football when it matters most! Jerry is the reason for the problem. Sad thing is, when his time comes to the end, his kids are no better at understanding football. As a cowboy fan thru hell and high water I understand that it's gonna be a hard rest of my life watching my team get it wrong year after year until I die because they already proved me right!

"Making America Great Again for America First Proponents: A Revolutionary Proposal for Comprehensive AI Government

To truly make America great again, we must go beyond empty rhetoric and take decisive action. This proposal outlines a revolutionary approach to governance—a comprehensive AI-driven government system that eradicates entrenched corruption, kleptocracy, money laundering, and kickbacks. The current system, plagued by foreign aid to Israel and campaign contributions from AIPAC, has perpetuated a cycle of corruption that we can no longer tolerate.

AIPAC as a Ransomware Virus AIPAC can be likened to a ransomware virus that has infiltrated and compromised the American political system. Just as ransomware takes control of a computer, demanding payment to unlock critical files, AIPAC has ensnared our government, manipulating policy decisions and holding our democracy hostage. The influence of AIPAC ensures that the flow of American tax dollars to Israel continues unabated, with the same money returning to influence our lawmakers, perpetuating a scam that has paralyzed true democratic governance.

The Need for a Complete Overhaul Like a computer infected with ransomware, our government system requires a complete overhaul—a reboot with a clean, uninfected program that is resistant to outside influence. This is where a comprehensive AI-driven government system comes in. By eliminating the virus-like influence of AIPAC and similar special interest groups, we can restore the integrity of our democracy.

Implementing a Comprehensive AI Government

Establish Direct Democracy: Replace traditional representatives in both houses with a system that allows citizens to participate directly in governance. This AI-driven government will operate transparently and in real-time, empowering citizens to engage in decision-making from the comfort of their homes.

Cut Ties with Special Interests: The AI system will be free from the influence of special interest groups, political parties, and foreign lobbies like AIPAC. Decisions will be made solely in the public’s interest, ending the manipulation of our government by outside forces.

End the Cycle of Corruption: By drastically reducing military spending and foreign aid, particularly to Israel, we will stop the flow of American tax dollars being used to buy influence in our government. This will eliminate the kickbacks and money laundering disguised as campaign contributions, ensuring that every decision is made for the benefit of the American people.

Benefits of the Comprehensive AI Government

Empowered Citizenry: The power is returned to the people, with direct democracy ensuring that governance decisions truly reflect the will of the public.

Enhanced Transparency and Accountability: The AI system’s actions are transparent and accountable, with all decisions accessible for public review, ensuring that the government remains in check.

Optimized Resource Allocation: AI-driven analysis will optimize resource allocation and policy decisions, improving public services, reducing waste, and directing resources to where they are needed most—improving infrastructure, education, healthcare, and more.

Improved Public Services and Infrastructure: By eliminating unnecessary military expenditures and focusing on domestic prosperity, the AI government will significantly enhance the quality of life for American citizens.

Checks and Balances: Built-in redundancies and independent oversight will ensure the AI system adheres to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, preventing corruption from taking root at its source. This will restore trust in the system, as every decision can be audited and verified for its adherence to American values and laws.

Conclusion This comprehensive AI government proposal offers the only viable path to making America truly great again. It empowers citizens, eliminates corruption, and refocuses our resources on what truly matters—improving the lives of the American people. By replacing traditional representatives with a transparent, accountable AI system, we can restore the true meaning of democracy and cleanse our government of the virus-like influence of special interest groups like AIPAC. The time for a complete overhaul is now, and with the right system in place, we can reboot America and restore it to its rightful greatness.",[],2025-04-04T01:03:44Z,@user-hw6nb1vw8v

"What no-one understands and realises is this: Money comes from nowhere. It does not matter if the government owes one dollar or a hundred trillion dollars. How has the debt affected the people of America? How has it affected an individual? Has anyone asked them to pay off the debt?  No. The debt is just a book-entry. Six months ago everyone was existing perfectly happy with the debt.  The debt does not affect anyone. It does not matter if the debt increases. No-one is affected now and no-one will be affected if it increases or decreases. The whole concept of taxes is a scam. The rich pay almost nothing towards the debt but they buy houses for tenants and buy companies and factories for the workers. Musk cannot use or eat his money. Even if he loses 99.9% he will still have millions. You have go to “think outside the box” and realise the only thing that matters is HARMONY. The most evil part of Trump and Musk is DISHARMONY.

The Lord has been gracious to us, and to our adult sons and their families. But now for us, as seniors on a fixed income, it is harder. We tried opening a small Airbnb to supplement our income. But those expenses allow us to break even. What will DOGE do to help seniors now? Medicare expenses makes medicines impossible with co-pays, deductibles, and corporate pharm cost. It is $ 600 month for one heart medication. Medicare helps with hospitalizations, but then we have big balances. If it weren't for my husband, who is legally blind with some peripheral vision, being under terrific VA care, we'd both have to do without medications and doctors visit.  Thank you for your efforts.

He eliminated government agencies that were investigating him. He just got every US citizens' sensitive information. Last time I checked, our personal data is very valuable to the tech sector. 

And the worst part is that Trump created this problem and he's allowing it to get worse. I don't blame him. It's smarter to let Elon break everything and be hated, so less people will focus on Trump's own failures.",[],2025-03-31T22:23:46Z,@guttersails7971

"I'm on dialysis & I've been waiting for my End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Medicare application to be approved since Oct 3, 2024. 

1 month BEFORE the election!

I filed at my local SSA in person & was told my paperwork was in order & I would get a Medicare number online within 24 hrs & a card in the mail in 3-5 budiness days.

I'm still waiting...
Endless phone calls, different agents different excuses.

Everyone i talk to at SSA says give it 30 days. How many 30 day periods do they need?

Mar 7, 2025, I was told my medicare application is ""stuck"" in the Phila Payment Center. I cant find the right person to complete it or who can get it completed.

This is a time sensitive issue.
How?
My 30 month insurance waiting period ends on May 1, 2025 when Medicare is MANDATED to be my primary insurance & my private insurance becomes secondary.

Dialysis is not cheap.
My oncology team & kidney transplant team that treats me at the University of Pennsylvania are also not cheap.

"Everyone in this interview (presumably the entire team) is white and male. That alone raises an issue of informed decision making and it’s inefficient. Check scholars and research on this topic (from Oxford to Harvard). 

You will find:

Diversity in decision-making teams is crucial when outcomes affect broad and varied populations. Teams composed of individuals from different backgrounds bring a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and problem-solving approaches, which helps to identify blind spots, reduce groupthink, and better anticipate the needs of diverse communities. From an intellectual and professional standpoint, diverse teams often make more accurate decisions and do so more efficiently by challenging assumptions early and uncovering better solutions faster. This leads to more robust, inclusive, and implementable strategies. Key benefits include:
	•	Faster identification of risks and opportunities across demographic lines
	•	More innovative and adaptable problem-solving
	•	Increased trust and legitimacy in decisions among stakeholders
	•	Reduction in costly missteps from overlooked perspectives",[],2025-03-31T14:32:54Z,@asaphbrown5800

"People keep calling Elon scammer... but the truth is, nobody in the federal government ever has published the a trillion dollar budget of federal government. We understand how budge works, it's money we put down as how much we'll spend, not necessarily spending them, but still it's money that will be spent or be wasted, we'd like to know how it was spent. Surely if the budge is a trillion this year, it's at least 900 billion last year, so how was the money spent last year? The federal government has never shown the accounting ledger to its citizen or tax payer.

Tax-payer wants to know how the trillion is spent; the problem is that the federal government was shut down a couple of times in the past without even know how those money were spent. Sure, it might not have been a-830-million dollar all going to the national park survey, but if that's what is planned for 2025, where did similar funds went in 2024? Just by saying that Elon is inaccurate because no contract has yet taken that amount out doesn't stop the fact that near a trillion dollar is wasted somewhere in the years building up to this past election... 

If the federal government cannot release the full ledger, then at least give us an example of how it was spent for different department... if showing accounting for the defense department is unsafe for national security, how about you do it for the fire department and for the department of interior... how were those couple of millions of dollar spent? who were they given to and how did it improve our life? why was it necessary? do it for the past decade, don't let it be a democrat-only-problem.... but if you cannot produce such result, even for the fed under Trump's first term, then it's probably very shady and have things you guys don't want to show, and therefore IT IS better be shut down by DOGE.

"Lastly, before I worked in equity research, I was in sales in Southern California years ago, and one of the businesses was my largest Hawaii customer, shipping product weekly to the U.S. Navy in Hawaii from San Pedro, CA. They charged an astronomical amount (product and freight bill) to the U.S. Navy, which purchased the product. I asked my customer, ""Why do you charge so much to the U.S. government in terms of the product and freight invoice?"" He said, ""Because the Navy just pays the bill, they do not audit the bill"". I said, ""You do realize that other companies are paying about $220.00 per pallet with the same cube/density to Hawaii, and you're paying $1,000 + the product. He said that he did not care. He stated to me, ""you enjoy the revenue and I enjoy the added margin from the U.S. Navy over-paying for the product and shipping."" So it's about time someone did something about this. My only concern is that we are the world's reserve currency.

"We badly need to keep Social Security programs. See Below.

Social Security is an Insurance plan not an Investment plan. 

Try Kindness:  On ABC Ch 7 News TV Sf Bay Area a homeless girl about a year ago  said,"" There are scarce Resources."" I,myself, in the past before homeless girl's Report here had submitted a scarce Resources Report also. I have never been homeless and worked all my life. 

Stereotyping is very sadly so much in error. 

Bad landlords, the poor being the victims of crimes, fear of unsafe shelters, shelters with time limits like Welfare Programs, shelters for1 week only stay, shelters putting the homeless out all day that drags down homeless spirit, and unaware and uninformed people not knowing sad plight of the poor nor see  in person. 

This is why we have the homeless. 

Try Kindness nothing else works. 

We must attend to bringing down the Federal Government Trillion deficit. Not  attending to needful Federal budget  Gov't deficit, it could be worse. 

Although not in U.S. Constitution, Healthcare is a Right.

The ""Right to Life"", Liberty, and The Pursuit of Happiness which  cannot be obtained if do not exist and have no life. 

Social  Security abounds in Myths. Other  people not just yourself Mr. Elon Musk  have thought it is a Ponzi scheme. But Social Security is an Insurance plan not an investment plan.

"If we stop taxing those who make less than $1 million a year (reduce their federal taxes to 0%), and take half of every dollar that is made above $1 million from the rich, there would be no deficit and every American would have free health care, guaranteed housing, and would have their higher education paid for.  The reason we have a deficit is because men like Elon Musk refuse to pay their fair share while complaining how they are victims of the big bad government.  Under this system, the rich would still be rich and would be able to buy anything they could possibly want, and the rest of us would be fed, clothed, housed, and educated.

NO TRAINING was offered or time to learn given. Access to GRB was available only from the government computer (forbidden to access from home) — there are hundreds if not thousands of links to terms and rules and laws). There was no way for the employee to verify anywhere whether the calculations were correct. Those employees still do not know whether the highest three years were chosen correctly. They learned literally in the last days of employment that those highest three years must be consecutive three years. Nowhere in FERS lit. was this highlighted.  

The direct email person/contact relied on someone else (in the “mine”? ) to answer Qs.

"Nice segment. 
Keep up the good works.
Unfortunately, many will never benefit from programs like social security. 
Even after over paying taxes, social security and other wage deductions, many become targets of corrupt governing bodies (corrupted individuals and groups) that exploit these programs as forms of retaliation of perceived (imaginary) ""threats."" 
Even if those being targeted have never been a ""threat"", and have likely endured numerous attacks from corrupt individuals and groups that abuse government agencies, there will likely be no resolution because the cost of defense in a corrupt legal system is not a possibility for nearly all of the working population.
The right to a jury trial is replaced with corrupt arbitration or prewritten judge verdicts.
Ultimately the falsely accused ""threats"" are added to future ""witch hunts"" (being added onto other corrupt persecution lists, mudding the water) while the corrupt individuals and groups never face prosecution for former evil acts.
Yes, this is the way of silly folks.
They truly are consumed by hate.
They are one evil angry lot.
If Trump, Elon and DOGE can help to clean up this mess, then that would be amazing.
If the team can do that with out collateral damage, then that would be a miracle.
Cleaning up evil in a world generally managed and played by evil folks is certainly a challenge.

"These men speak as if corporations have always had the best interests of people in mind over their own personal profits.  And yet we KNOW that corporations, ESPECIALLY oil companies, have repeatedly lied to the American people, sacrificing millions of lives a year in order to line their own pocketbooks.  

The definition of fascist oligarchy is exactly what's happening at DOGE. 

I am all for cutting government waste. But that waste needs to go through a process of due diligence so vital services like disease prevention, nuclear safety and air travel can be protected.  The claims of precision, compassion and caution have already been proven to be false. Planes are still falling out of the sky and  the spread of Aids, even to children has been greatly exacerbated because of the DOGE cuts. 

This is why proposed cuts need to be approved by CONGRESS as part of the democratic process. 

If you really want to cut waste, slash the trillions of dollars in corporate subsidies, not medicaid and vital services to those who need it most.",[],2025-03-30T21:13:44Z,@ariamay2

"I had a dream a few years ago, that I went to the bank to take out money (it seemed like Saudi Arabia's 15-minute ""The Line"" city, pretty, new, a little like Europe),
And I had my Mom's bank card (who is a retiree), and her card had Elon Musk's name on it.
And in the dream, I went inside the bank to take out money (I suppose), and I set the card on the counter, and the card started flashing red, like a bomb.
So, I became scared about the card bomb, and I left it on the counter and ran out of the building as fast as I could..
and within seconds after I exited the building, it blew up.
And then I looked up into the sky, and I saw a huge dragon, which was in space, and visible from the ground, appearing to enter into Earth's outer atmosphere.
The Dragon was moving like a Serpent, and I knew that the Dragon must have been GIGANTIC! (maybe 100 miles long?)
And as the serpent was coming down into the Earth's atmosphere...
it *Stopped*.
The Dragon appeared to freeze.
Then the dream ended.


And I think that the Dragon freezing (stop moving) on it's way down meant that God has full control over everything that is happening.
And that nothing is happening unless everything is in order.
The Devil cannot make things happen, but God is in control.
And we are close to the end.

We all need to submit to God in every way that He has asked and called us to do.
And do our Father's work.

"Anyone skeptical of corporate billionaires’ interest in government efficiency, need only consider that the less tax money the government wastes, the fewer taxes it will require of them, the more real government contracts will be available to them, the more funding and fewer taxes that will be available for their workers which will in turn require less from their companies. The corporate benefits of a government that is less wasteful and more efficient is huge and it’s not only good for them, it’s good for the rest of us. Who wants to see their taxes raised or their company’s taxes raised while the government is wasting hundreds of billions of dollars? That’s what these billionaires interest is.

Musk did not attend the meeting, which infuriated Larson.

“Where’s Elon Musk?” he asked, pointing to Musk’s empty seat. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated. But that does not put him above the law, or the responsibility to come before this committee and this Congress.”

"People are leaving the government on terms that they can be selected and given 8 months pay while not working, and they are also able to pick up another source of income in the free time that they now have. This was seen as a possible ease into retirement, which any loyal employee who had put in their service would be hesitant to ignore. However, they were also given discretion to be rehired after the 8 month period. Stating that there is voluntary exodus because there is a lack of respect or outdated programs is incorrect. That is not to say the outdated tech is not true. I will say that I am totally for updating practically the entirety of data storage, transferring, and usage. Hurry up and wait is the government slogan. It's a common grievance but it also makes a bit of sense. There is also waste in the government, but there is the same in any entity that deals with monetary exchange and discretion.  It's the machine we run companies through as a capitalistic society. 

I look forward to a day where things are more efficient. However, haste creates oversight in security as well. I wish the best for a positive outcome, but I am hesitant in putting my hopes in a government that seems to be becoming more privatized.

Problem is you aren’t finding the numbers you say you are and you’ve let go of federal workers and disrupted services without doing your due diligence.  You have not consulted congress.

"If Doge believes they are honest about their cuts then they should release an official report with everything included. Musk already said they're not going to have an official report. So everyone believing this is completely taking him by his word, when facts have already come out that the amounts of their cuts have been wrong and were much lower than they were reporting.   
Social Security is the most successful government program and it keeps 18 million seniors out of poverty every year. And if they knew anything they would know that Social Security is not going bankrupt. If the cap on the program isn't lifted by around 2035, the program will pay 83% of benefits. That's not bankrupt. 

If Elon wants to cut waste then why not start with himself. He's taking an awful lot of subsidies from our government and he has gained more government contracts since he was appointed not elected and started his unofficial ""job"".  So it's okay for Musk to receive billions of dollars from tax payers and that should not be cut, but it's just the poor and working class that needs to be cut from. 
And conservatives trust him to make these decisions after he revealed his true feelings and called Social Security a ponzi scheme. Is this the guy you want to handle this job?",[],2025-03-30T04:30:25Z,@guttersails7971

Als Trump 2025 die Präsidentschaftswahlen gewinnt, unterhält er bereits seit Jahrzehnten Verbindungen zu Geschäftsleuten mit Verbindungen zur Kreml-Elite. 
Ein Blick auf die Vergangenheit zeigt eine lange gemeinsame Geschichte von Trump und Russland. Immer wieder halfen ihm russische Oligarchen finanziell aus der Patsche, wie der deutsche TV-Sender ZDF schon vor Jahren berichtete. Und auch der KGB befasst sich schon länger mit dem Immobilienmogul.

"I am a huge fan of government efficiency 

However, I find it challenging to trust statements from Musk and his associates due to the prevalent misinformation.

Example using ChatGPT:
“

Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), recently claimed that the federal government spent nearly $1 billion on a simple survey that could have been conducted for approximately $10,000. Specifically, he referred to a National Park Service survey, suggesting it was a significant example of government waste.  ￼ ￼

However, investigations have found no evidence supporting this assertion. CBS News reported that there is no record of the Department of the Interior allocating or planning to allocate such a substantial amount for a survey or any single contract.  ￼

This isn’t the first time DOGE’s claims have been scrutinized. In another instance, DOGE reported canceling an $8 billion contract with U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, but further examination revealed the contract’s actual value was only $8 million.  ￼

Given these discrepancies, it’s advisable to approach such claims with caution and seek corroborating evidence from multiple reputable sources.”","['I truly feel these individuals and Elon are truly well intentioned and have no intended malice.', 'Competence is as crucial as intent in these initiatives. By making numerous claims that are significantly inaccurate, they undermine their credibility through baseless assertions.', '@NYX_003 I don’t believe many people oppose the DOGE; rather, they are frustrated with its pattern of making baseless and highly exaggerated claims. For instance, DOGE asserted it saved $8 billion by canceling a contract, which was later revealed to be only $8 million—a significant overstatement that undermines its credibility']",2025-03-29T21:11:29Z,@fereydunk

If we follow that reasoning he could literally do anything he wanted and could never be challenged because anyone who challenges would become a traitor. All of this talk about people not looking into the specifics, he needs to do the same thing for others, especially those that are getting harmed by his policies. The public sector job  market for well paying jobs is in the dumpster and government jobs are in high demand for their stability. Without government essential services and stable jobs the American citizens will suffer. Lastly, and maybe the worst, is his misrepresentation of how US debt works, claiming it is just like a household. Government spending is nothing like a household, and he completely neglects to mention our federal reserves system works. The government debt is normally tracked through government bonds to the American people. The government being in debt to the citizens in no way bankrupts the citizens. It’s the governments responsibility to pay those debts, and by the way the government always pays.

"ruling 2-3 castes people constituting 15% of total Indian population of India has for century  mastered the art of dividing and ruling over 80% of unorganised indian population. These 2-3 previledged castes occupy 95% of all superior positions in the bureaucracy & judiciary in the country. They control press & media 
   I can't say if it is fully correct People say in north india the casteist daily newspapers which promote hatred among various unorganised castes in india in the lead is Hindustan Times, followed by Times of India, Hindu, Press Trust of India, Tribune, Jagran etc even indian express which was quite fair a decade ago has joined their wagon. These media houses also don't have much good words for Elon Musk (his tesla cars, exploded star ship, phone service), Trump, Vance & china ( forget about pakistan). For example some show  Trump licking feet of Elon Musk and putin. Elon Musk's star ship brought stranded Sunita Williams to earth. India's media had been full of glorifying news for Sunita Williams whose parents belongs to upper caste. This media totally blacked out goodness of Elon Musk whose space ship brought her down to earth when NASA & BAIDEN had failed miserably. She could have parished in space but for Elon Musk & Trump. These ungrateful castes are selfish of highest order. Similarly they blackout good deeds of other castes in india & unduly magnify as lead story of their small mistakes. On other hand they falsely glorify fake achievements of their castes & supress all heinous crimes of their castes.",[],2025-03-29T17:21:48Z,@NarendraKumar-ts1bf

"Elon's comments on the war in Ukraine are completely uninformed. Ridiculous. Mark Kelly didn't say anything wrong in his twitter post. To call him a traitor for that show's Musks misunderstanding of the situation. We should continue support, and in my opinion, we should increase support to Ukraine. If the west stops supporting Ukraine, it won't result in peace. It will result in Russia conquering Ukraine, followed by an insurgency. The violence will continue for years, if not decades. Only one person has the ability to make peace in Ukraine. That's Putin. Putin has shown no interest in peace. His demands are ridiculous. Also, Elon suggests that the war is a stalemate and that the front lines haven't moved in two years. But the Russian army has gained 4000 square kilometers in the past year. He seems to suggest that Ukraine could simply stop fighting and the war would end. Russia won't stop until the price becomes too much. The only way to get Russia to that point is by supporting Ukraine. Putin only understands one thing. Power. It's time for the United States to help Putin understand American firepower.",[],2025-03-29T14:45:48Z,@doggy7210

"can you help me develop a detailed and well-researched book on the topic of combating corruption and promoting ethical behavior?

Absolutely, I can help you outline the content and structure of the book, provide guidance on research, and suggest key points to cover. Let's break down the book into several chapters, and for each chapter, I'll outline the main topics and subtopics you could consider including:

And when you start catching mysterious bills in your subscriptions because of them copying and selling your information, you'll SEE why it's unconstitutional. They are stripping away protective rights - including financial - for a reason. So they can manipulate all this information they are collecting on YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. Any possible demographic can be exploited. That's why this so-called group going into our private files without us even knowing who they are....\nFurthermore, if this group is just air, they can say YOU stole something vital, caused a crash, are a member of DOGE.

I’m one of those people who supports you. I know you’re a businessman and a smart guy, and I’ve got a lot of respect for that. But I’ve got a question about our country’s national security that’s been on my mind—specifically about our space programs, the FAA, and NOAA. To me, these are things that need to always be controlled by the government and supervised by our top security agents to keep America safe and secure.
Here’s my concern: Is Elon Musk “scamming” the USA by dissolving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to benefit his company, SpaceX? There are concerns and allegations swirling around about his influence over federal agencies and contracts, especially since he’s running your Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

"Absolute lies if they were being so careful there wouldn't be so many instances where they have had to rehire people. There wouldn't be math mistakes on their wall of receipts. They wouldn't be deleting receipts off the walls when people have pointed out inaccuracies. People wouldn't be so upset if they were being careful and what they were doing was actually liked. Here are some specifics for you; cutting national park workers has many, many people upset. Cutting workers and offices within social security also has many people upset because you can not expect elderly people to navigate a website or to be going into offices. Closing offices also makes that pretty hard to do. Also just because someone is listed in social security doesn't mean they are getting benefits. This has been fact checked and debunked. Stop lying. Twisting the truth about what funds are actually being used for is also why people are upset. Those of us with real common sense know money wasn't spent ""making mice transgender"". People are also upset about cutting medical research and halting medical trials that are in progress. I could go on and on. Are you deleting any comments that are negative? Sure looks like it.

"This... Is actually good.... Iv been against Trump... But I think... Elon may be doing us good... I dont know yet... But Iv always known that the government has been corrupt, and purposely had things like this cave exist TO slow things down. Or keep things at a certain pace... Iv seen computers at government offices and stuff..... And the software they use, plus all FSSA sites, and the phone system is all living in the 90s.. And clearly there are still things that havent been updated from the 1900s

I repair and fix computers on the side because I taught myself alot about my own computers just for gaming. So iv noticed alot of inefficiencies first hand in the government... It alot like manufacturing obsolescence, which Thomas Edison did with the light bulb and they still do to this day... They were able to make light bulbs that lasted 100's of times longer.. Apple is known for manufacturing product obsolescence... Creating software updates to no longer be quite compatible with the battery, or just flat out ""pretends"" the battery just isnt charging right... So you gotta get that new 1000$ iPhone! Its despicable and why I cant support Trump, and billionaires... I believe they shouldn't exist, no individual needs literally 10000's of lifetimes worth of money... When you KNOW they have to stomp all over the peoples backs and siphon those profits from us... We are the ones that ultimately pay by not gaining what we should.. The lobbyists have focused on minimum wage and kept it as low as they can possibly keep it by ultimately buying the laws we are supposed to be deciding on...

This is something iv always noticed, and even the guy interviewing him doesnt understand tech either and how the implementation will relieve so much stress on the government that it literally makes you wonder how a system with the FBI, CIA and the military industrial complex could allow the other programs of the government lag so far behind...

I always received a FORM letter (exact same letter) thanking me for contacting his office. NEVER any reference to my particular concern. 
He & Gallego we’re here in AZ holding a meeting. They were telling the people Elon was cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid! Also saying President Trump was acting like a 12 year old not knowing anything about running a Country other than creating Chaos!!! Kelly was also saying these things on our local TV!! Kelly had to tell everyone about his loyalty and years he served, also years in space program, etc. His greatest asset is puffing his feathers, saying look at me!! Sorry, in Michigan we always called that sort of person a “blow gut”..  Oh yes, Kelly said Elon is a liar, no way did he have to rescue the stranded astronauts. He said Elon didn’t even have a rocket to get them when he offered to Biden to go get them!! It is SO SAD the Democrats want to continue running our Country into bankruptcy!!! Schumer said on TV, they hired 235 Progressive Judges before President Trump took over. He said, we WILL get our CONTROL back!! Everything I’ve read says Marxism, Socialism and Communism all have to have CONTROL of everything and everyone. 
If you look up Bernie Sanders, it says he’s a Democratic Socialist!! So, America, go figure where we are headed! SAD!!

"If I were Mr. Musk, I would not have troubled myself with attempting to rescue these left-wing socialist imbeciles from their own folly. It is an utterly thankless endeavour that he has embarked upon, and to be met with criticism for it is nothing short of astonishing. The fact that so many outspoken, conceited, smug, and profoundly gullible Democrats find fault with his application of logic and rationality speaks volumes about the current state of political discourse.

Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur and innovator, has consistently demonstrated an unwavering commitment to advancing human progress through his various ventures, such as Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. His efforts to promote free speech and challenge the prevailing narratives on platforms like X have been met with fierce resistance from those who cling to their ideological biases. These self-proclaimed champions of social justice, often hailing from the left-leaning spectrum of the Democratic Party, seem to prioritise their feelings over facts and reason.

The American political landscape appears increasingly polarised, with the Democratic Party veering towards policies that some critics argue resemble socialism—a system that has historically led to economic stagnation and the erosion of personal freedoms in nations like Venezuela and Cuba.

Musk's decision to engage with these issues, despite the inevitable backlash, underscores his dedication to fostering a more open and honest dialogue. However, the vitriol directed at him by those who prefer to wallow in their own sanctimonious echo chambers suggests that his efforts may be akin to casting pearls before swine—an exercise in futility when faced with such entrenched ignorance and arrogance.",[],2025-03-28T18:45:08Z,@soahc-chaos

1. The fact: none were fired through ""Reduction in Force"" (RIF).

Why do we as Republicans start this? We saw the people protesting because they were locked out of their offices employment was terminated.

"Elon musk and his doge team, they've been incredible work and a great service for this country and I am also extremely grateful I would like to extend my gratitude to him and let's not forget Donald Trump and what he give up you know to do this thing. And I have a great amount of respect for Donald Trump's cabinet that he put together these are great people. 
 And once again let's not forget who it was that got this ball rolling that was Mr Trump. Let's not forget how Donald Trump and his family have suffered incredibly at the hands of these Democratic left-wing Lulu's and the swamp. All of these people have done nothing but persecute him and his family ever since 2015 he has suffered financial losses that cannot be underestimated. If I'm not mistaken over the last 3 years or something he has spent about $250 to 300 million just in lawyer fees, I'm not sure about those numbers it's just off the top of my head but it's got to be pretty close if not a lot more. On top of all that they tried to assassinate him. It's only by the grace of God that he's still here dragging his ball around. And we all know who it was that attempted to rub him out.

It would be fixed in less than 1 weeks. As for programming help.

They have money the government does not, they have the ideas the government does not. Trump realizes this. People that have a vision. Dems have none. Real rubicon moment.

Extends Trump’s tax cuts of basically for the wealthy donor who donate hundreds of millions in campaign contributions to both parties. By extending the tax cuts for years. Will add trillions to the deficit and reduce tax revenue by trillions.Trump’s original plan was to make the tax cuts for wealthy donors permanent. Which is like Project 2025 on steroids. All that has to watched,down the road. Is the nation debt. So far the nation debt has increased by billions in February. If each month goes by. There are months that the debt is increasing.

Just look at Georgia, where 20% of the country remains occupied by Russia. The atrocities committed there when they cut children’s head and play football and 
Other atrocities committed in Ukraine prove that force is the only language Putin understands. Strength is the only way to deter further aggression.

"1. Oligarchy and the unchecked influence of billionaires:
Sanders vehemently criticizes the ""oligarchic form of society” in which a handful of billionaires control the government. He faults wealthy individuals like Elon Musk for trying to cut important social programs like Social Security and the Veterans Administration in order to provide tax breaks for the rich. He sees this as ""greed of the oligarchy ” as the country's worst evil. The fact that the three richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of the population is cited as evidence of this oligarchy.

2. Attacks on democracy by Donald Trump:
Sanders accuses President Donald Trump of undermining the Constitution. He criticizes his attacks on the First Amendment by intimidating the media and persecuting critics. He also criticizes Trump's disregard for the constitutional responsibilities of Congress, such as the unlawful withholding of funds and the dismantling of agencies. Trump's attacks on the independence of the judiciary are also sharply criticized.

3. Massive economic and social inequalities: 
Sanders denounces the extreme income and wealth inequality in the US. He emphasizes that the rich have never been so well off, while many working families are struggling to survive. He criticizes the fact that CEOs earn 300 times more than the average worker and that workers' real wages have fallen despite increases in productivity. He addresses the precarious situation of people who live from paycheck to paycheck, cannot afford rising rents and healthcare costs and, in the worst case, become homeless.

4. Defective and unaffordable healthcare system: 
Sanders criticizes the “broken, dysfunctional and outrageously expensive” US healthcare system. He criticizes the fact that the USA spends a disproportionate amount on healthcare compared to other developed countries, but has a lower life expectancy. He denounces the high number of uninsured and underinsured people and criticizes the fact that the system is geared towards maximizing the profits of insurance and pharmaceutical companies instead of ensuring healthcare as a human right. The high cost of prescription drugs is also highlighted as a serious problem.

5. Corrupt political system: 
Sanders sees a corrupt campaign finance system in which billionaires can buy elections and criticizes the two-party landscape in which both Republicans and Democrats pander to the interests of big corporations and wealthy donors.",[],2025-03-28T15:11:54Z,@TheNokturnalTimes

Like himself he knew what would happen if you dare to question the narrative or authority. Take up your cross , he knew they would crucify you. That is what they are trying to do to Trump and Musk - but I believe with all my heart they were sent by the creator to protect us from the corruption and evil.

"Glad I watched this video. Computer systems that communicate with each other across government agencies are critically important. I recently went through a government filing that took nearly a year, despite a 30-day estimate. Every agency I spoke with had inconsistent information about the process and my forms.

"Great interview. As a veteran and 20 years federal servant in IT I wish what they are saying about IRS and SSA systems was not true but, sadly it is.  I have friends in these agency complain and report through their leadership and document it all but, nothing changes.  In my agency we have issues with our policies and as much as I report and file grievances nothing ever happens.  I wish they would extend retirement options for those lot us under 50 but have over 20 years of service because I would take it.  I love our country and my time in the service but if we really want to fix this problem we need the leadership in the WH to make this happen.  

I am not here to start fights and I am sorry for the civilians who lost their job and were not a part of the problem overall but, most Americans agree something has to be done.

Again, great interview.

From an old OIF/OIR USAF Vet!","[""Thank you for your service to our country❤\nBut let me add, Bidens mandate of the cvd sht caused thousands to leave the military and medical fields..\nThis was a horrible overreach to force many to do something they didn't Want to do and cost their jobs, livelihoods and education....pure evil."", ""That's awesome! I'm so happy to listen to this"", ""What you are saying is correct but don't leave out the other part. To upgrade these systems is going to cost A LOT of money. It costs more than a traditional start up because you can't have ANY down time, cannot lose ANY data, and cannot afford ANY additional security vulnerability. So you know a big reason nothing gets down is because they don't have the stomach to ask for the money it'll take to get done, even though it needs to happen. This is the struggle of the government workers that are getting attacked worse than Tesla owners. If EM can start acknowledging some of these things instead of acting like he's the sole genius, he'd be getting much more buy-in."", 'Thank you for your service']",2025-03-28T14:08:31Z,@chrisg6343

Just so happens that I started out working with NASA, and moved to consultant for 35 years with companies like AT&T, CSX, Bank of America and many others including being a CIO of my own company.

The question that is never asked or discorauged is ""How well?"". And that is because career bureaucrats likes the status quo and ""Dont rockthe boat!"" mentality.  And change needs shakedown and severe discomfort. The politicians stays away because they know that they are on a revolving door. Bureaucrats should have term limits. It should not be life long career. It should be aresult oriented career. Making that change is tremedously difficult even in private sector!

"Causation… “I’m in the process of retirering my now ‘disabled’ husband from a major US corporation. It’s been 112 anguishing days of pounding on a corporate network wall with no real HR support. HR functions are divided and sub-contracted out. Nightmare. No one from the time I said “help please,” explained the “ our situation or options,” or has guide me through this process. NO checklist. They’re all behind the corporate wall. No one would digitally or paper send me those pages.  In the mean time we’ve lost our health insurance, because I didn’t know. (Verbally told many different things.) I’m told it may be months before govt adds us to Medicare. Govt wouldn’t allow Medicare, we were paying into HSA. “On-line (documents, yes) is not always best.  How will Doge integrate the human factors, assistance and compassion ?” Make it functional for all?  Doge please do this from (undercover boss) perspective.  I believe in Doge. Please review the whole process including the exceptions “like my husband.

"""we'll show you what they're finding"", said by Fox News in reference to Doge. While I entirely agree that money is being wasted and it's a necessity spending can be cut due to streamlining of services, Doge isn't actually showing us, the public, anything. It's a panel of billionaires discussing what they are potentially doing. We, the public, need to see facts and figures. If they are achieving exactly what they are claiming and they are being transparent, ie showing the tax payers what they are achieving, then they are beyond criticism imo. But we need hard data.I see many comments lauding Doge, based on nothing but hearsay from the guys on the team with Elon Musk. Facts, Figures, Evidence. Let's see it. 

In other news, Whiskas cat food manufacturers reduced their 100g cat food pouches to 85g, the price hasn't reduced. Whiskas claim they have done this because research shows cats don't tend to eat a full pouch at each meal. I have three cats, none are overweight, all in great health, I am now having to feed them an additional meal a day because one pouch is not enough! Whiskas claim there is research, where is it, where is the data to back up their claims?","['Well Herb, It takes a little time to collect all the facts and figures u want to  see , and the results of it all may take a little longer still. u think?😅 Time is ur enema Herb😮', ""@Nowoke4me You're missing the point, Nowoke4me. Does it not concern you that Fox News states they are going to show what Doge are achieving, which amounts to a group of billionaires talking? We aren't being shown anything as yet. Of course it's going to take time, but so far, it's talk. There needs to be transparency. e.g. digitalising that mine of paperwork is going to take a bank of people considerable time, where's the set up for that?

"I want to share a personal experience here that is a small example of the large fracture in our govt systems. I'll summarize to make this read easy. My brother was receiving Medicaid and wanted to willfully change (due to new/increased income) over to a marketplace plan. He signed up, registered, and paid Cigna for his new plan, while simultaneously canceling Medicaid. Medicaid then turned around and forcefully told him, ""You're not allowed to change to marketplace unless we tell you so, and only after we review your income."" He said, ""Why, I don't need Medicaid any longer, and I'm doing what is right according to my income so you no longer need to provide me with FREE Medicaid."" They forcefully replied ""Because that is our policy and we make those decisions for you."" True and 100% accurate story here folks, I'm not kidding! Imagine a system that won't allow you to voluntarily change and pay based on your increased income!

"I am a software engineerer and to me this makes a lot of sense, what Musk and his people say.
Often there are a lot of really old systems which are extremly inefficent. Not only in government but also in the private sector(but in the government its probably worse).
Also its not only IT-systems. I can very well imagine that every-day systems nobody cares about are also extremly inefficient.

Why is inefficiency bad somebody might ask? Well, it basically effects your wealth and how much effort you have to take to maintain your wealth. When half the country is occupied with useless activities people don't have jobs like
-engineer
-doctor and medical personal
-scientiest
-security
-many other services which are important

As a result somebody has to work more hours for the same amount of wealth(=combined amount of goods and services)

What Elon does really is the next step for developing civilization. Garbage-collection is extremly important, else systems will fail due to its bloat. The problem is that people tend to add content to a system but don't care about removing content which is either unnessessary or even harmful.

Unfortunatly there are a lot of people who take advantage of inefficiencies and inconsistancies. This is why Musk is hated so much. These people who live with/by the inefficiencies are actually poor people (because their live resolved around doing useless stuff).",[],2025-03-28T11:55:16Z,@renor4431

"Our Gov is full of parasitic programs and agencies. Its covered in leech-like NGOs.
Its infected with Woke DEI cultural disease. Its pathetic. 
Representive Government is a reflection of The People.
Doge is the mirror and budget cuts are the cure.
We should be horrified by Our Government's appearance, not proud of it. 
Uncle Sam needs to go on a strict diet, exercise, stop complaining that its too hard, and start losing weight.
Losing 15% is just the beginning, its the easy part.
We should be supporting Uncle Sam's resolve.. not indulging him with snacks and down time.
This fiscal reality check was ignored and neglected for FIVE decades. We knew Social Security/ Medicare/Medicaid was in trouble way back in 1980.
We elected Representatives and Presidents to address the problems.. but they neglected them, year after year.. term after term.. President after president. Nobody wanted to touch it for fear of losing votes, not getting reelected.
Trump and DOGE are the first legitimate attempt to do get OUR Government back into shape. If we don't get our collective mind right and support the EFFORT, America is headed for an early grave.
The Left has proven that they want to maintain the staus quo.. they embrace the failings of Government like a masterpiece of Democracy they must protect, preserve and enshrine.
Imagine what great things we could have done without a 36 trillion dollar debt, much of which is due to a irresponsible Tax and Spend Culture.

""Here’s the bottom line. Patients can beat this disease. And we can beat this disease. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to work together at every level — federal, state and local. And we have to keep leading the global response, because the best way to stop this disease, the best way to keep Americans safe, is to stop it at its source — in West Africa.""

– President Obama, October 25, 2014

""Ten months ago, the first U.S. personnel deployed to West Africa to fight the Ebola outbreak on the frontlines in West Africa. This epidemic has grown into the deadliest Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen — and the President is committed to treating and tackling Ebola as both a national security priority, and an example of American leadership.

""The U.S. has built, coordinated, and led a worldwide response to the Ebola outbreak while strengthening our preparedness here at home. And thanks to the hard work of our military members, civilian responders, and health care workers, we have dramatically bent the curve of the epidemic. Cases are down 80 percent from peak levels. With this improved outlook, the President is planning to bring virtually all of the troops who deployed to the region home by April 30, while continuing to ramp up our civilian response beyond the 10,000 civilian workers who are already involved in our response effort.

"To have someone so ... well, awesome as A#1 Elon Musk and his team of awesomeness actually making a dent, auditing, and streamlining the bureaucracy... is well, beyond Uncle's imagination. When I wrote the meme making a joke of it even down to the ceremonial passing of the chainsaw... HE DID IT!!! Uncle was joking you incredible person.😮.. you.... Uncle means youse (y'all)*. 
Yes, your welcome ... This Uncle wrote the meme that gave that awesome man the idea for DOGE... so, your wrlcome but Uncle's Creative Consulting can only do so much... lay an idea or 2 out there and some people like A#1 will RUMINATE on an idea and it will blossom, & blume like a rose. Ruminate means to actually let an idea ferment, so to speak in your mind... from Uncle's POV it's like planting a seed)...
*Youse/y'all are 1st person gender neutral plural.

It's time to balance the budget.,"['Yes by cutting tax and red tape on the richest people because they will employ us on good salaries. Oh wait, robots.', ""Then that's what Democrats do, fact!\nAs the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\r\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \nI believe Gavin Newsome would make an excellent Secretary of State, but only time will reveal whether he reaches the elevations of Henry Kissinger or Hilary Clinton in the job.

You guys are doing a great job and keep it up we all thank you ALL 🙏!!!!!,"[""As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\r\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \r\nSources:\r\nBBC World\r\nNews\r\nReuters""]",2025-03-28T10:43:51Z,@LouisHuelsman

These people have worked very hard to become very wealthy, they have come to the realization if nothing is done about the waste and the Trillions of dollars in debt- all the money they have worked so hard to earn is nothing more than toilet paper. 

Any glancing view of the history of nations who have had hyperinflation from printing off millions and billions out of thin air with nothing to back should be enough of an explanation for why making sure our Dollar survives and maintains its value.

"The classic western; 'The Magnificent 7' saw a group of men come together to save a Mexican village of honest, hard-working people from being continually plundered by evil bandits. The 7 all had unique skillsets and none were 'choirboys', but thay ALL had a sense of decency and were against injustice. Only 2 of the 7 survived, but they did set the village free.  IF this film was real and the events within it were happening  today, how alarming would it be to witness millions of Democrats cheering on the bandits and rooting for them to defeat the 7. Well, THAT is exactly what is occurring with DOGE.

"You know I wasted 15 years of my active years where decision to help this world or to fight for my career was critical yet I decided to help the World. I wrote a Constitution of Earth, but because I’m not American or western but rather orthodox no one has heard about it and even more when I renewed my drivers license the other day in NZ, I have been literally molested while taking photo, and of course they have chosen the worst one to enclose.  I guess they wanted to find expression that would support the statement that you just have made, there is an evil in this world. Looking at my angry face as one can find your face expressions Elon Musk very often strange would not be yet enough of a prove of someone’s evilness. I’m going to make bold statements in that regard, I do not believe there are evil people and I do not believe in evil I believe in people doing variety of things for variety of reasons and that is how I would call it. But introducing your practices and then using closing statement there is an evil in this world reflects very much on some kind of Vatican style of hunting  witches. Just selection of expressions doesn’t look to me contemporary enough and if someone doesn’t do it from being contemporary as how I find myself defined but rather using expressions and believe system of the previous it looks to me as not properly attending the past because that is what you have found there, the actual empire not being properly updated, not being properly recognised, being treated as the other side of the coin, being treated as dead because let’s notice one more thing reference to a tomb for example it is a reference to dead people, yet it seems none of the presidents can neither promise their presidency neither that much of work they can promise if not using a thumb. So I think reforming of history just began and I also think it’s not going to be only the work of Americans as frankly it is not their recent analysis at all work of Americans. Maybe they started it maybe they initiated it but it is not their work. I’m talking about the reform I’m working on in last 15 years, the reform is not of US of America and it cannot be conducted by US of America and I have impression that you are just colliding with my authority to write, my freedom rights and my identity rights and I’m not after your money you are just using my billions and calling them yours let’s translate also that in 2000 years old history happening in wrong terms. How many trillions we are talking that your country owes to the history.? The history of amphitheatres, history of political philosophy which today I have awakened and assisted me to deliver my analysis which I can see your building is using it without permission or directives and I just wonder how all of that can be justifying at all, not what you’re doing but the valentine paper you have decided to use to wrap your work. It’s like we are in war of roses again, well I just discovered Olymp of my philosophical work rather than Atlantis.

"Wouldn't you just look at the HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THE PENTAGON CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR IN EACH OF IT'S LAST SEVEN YEARLY AUDITS?! Obviously...hello?!

According to their own ""Wall of Receipts"" website DOGE has saved $130 billion dollars so far. Putting that into perspective, they've saved less than 15% of the Pentagon's annual budget, the budget that the Pentagon can't even account for half of in each of the last 7 years audits. That means that the Pentagon ""loses"" over 3x every year what DOGE has managed to save by sacking tens of thousands of American civil servants, resulting in thousands of legal cases against the administration which of course the taxpayer will foot the bill for including any penalties & compensation that will no doubt follow as they have lost over 90% of cases that have gone before a judge so far. 

Won't be much of that $130 billion left by the time the courts are finished finding most of this administration's actions, performed with good intentions or not, to have been performed outside of the scope allowed for by the Constitution, mainly because they've attempted to circumvent Congress with Executive Orders, which in most cases they have known the Courts would strike them down. It gives the impression of doing stuff when in fact you're not, but also gives you the Courts to blame for your eventual inaction on nearly all of the election promises that would have helped ordinary Americans.

"While some argue that DEI undermines merit by focusing on identity over qualifications, this view assumes that merit is always fairly recognized. In reality, many talented individuals are overlooked due to systemic barriers like bias in hiring, unequal access to education, or cultural assumptions about what success looks like. DEI doesn’t lower the bar—it clears hidden obstacles that prevent true merit from being seen. By expanding opportunity and removing bias, DEI allows a more accurate and fair evaluation of ability, ensuring that success is based on potential and performance, not privilege.",[],2025-03-28T08:31:25Z,@imyourlandlord

The problem with the list of decrees: it's the list to undermine democracy!
The Republican fight against freedom is also on the rise at the US state level - especially when it comes to women's rights.

After almost two months of Trump, we can say that there is a kind of perverse competition to curtail freedom. What worries me most for the coming months is that Trump has incited his supporters to enforce his anti-freedom policies on a day-to-day basis.

The quote from Thomas Jefferson says: “Institutions must evolve to keep pace with the times.” Donald Trump, however, is doing everything he can to undermine or completely abolish these very institutions.

I never understood the hate for him even before siding with trump. He seems like a good guy to me he's a Lil odd compared to the average person. But in a good way like how when asked something doesn't just shout first thing in mind he actually takes a moment to think before opening his mouth. Him buying Twitter was one the biggest things saved free speech from becoming priveledged speech. Like the dems tried to make it out to be. All they're exposing now imagine if could expose things in previous years. How long have they been doing what they do. 20 years ago it might not been alot of woke crap.

"Wow! Whàt a SPIN! Now it’s a ‘scalpel’ and you want to be ‘carefull!? Thàt wasn’t the message you send out with your chainsaw, was it? 
Al of a sudden you communicate what you should have done BEFORE you fired those ten thousands of people?? And because you had to rehire, due to a courtorder, you now all of a sudden are só respectfull and empathetic? 😂 Good thing there is some control over you being reckless. And then you create another BLAME that people who complain, because they’re worried, to be FRAUDSTERS, to justify that? Please..
You could have saved yourselfes the critique and the Tesla violence (anger) that you provoked yourself! 
Did you ever hear of a communications oficer to, UPFRONT, INFORM the people about the goals, like you do in your businesses?  
You found ONE baby, receiving a small business loan? WOW, you deserve a medal! 
Truth is that the processes are to be modernised and can be made more efficient, cause, in time, they age,regardless. Thàt should have been the message, don’t you think? Thàt could have saved the costst of lawsuits and judges on the expence of the taxpayer! Moreover, saved yourself the critique ànd the backlash. 

You emphasize your own casualties and (grand)children to play on emotions, but what about the victims of your actions? 
You emphasize all kinds of ‘illegal’ benefits, but what about your own billion of dollars subsidies? 

But you don’t like to admit all that, do you?",[],2025-03-28T05:42:54Z,@Jolien-o8r

All of them getting golden retirement parachutes.

The private sector when they want to cut costs … they terminate a lot of jobs … just a number of people that match a cost cutting figure with no real analysis other than a feeling by executives on what is needed. After the cut they reassign the work and it either gets done or not.

The company will then find out if it can operate with fewer people or if it needs to refill some of those cut jobs … or will see if they can manage to come up with a workaround to make that job unnecessary.

"Reducing financial govt waste is alwaysa good thing. The American national debt is over 36 TRILLION dollars.

They are also suggesting that because of their cuts, America will be “solvent.” He says this in the interview. The math isn’t mathing, America. 36 trillion minus 1 trillion = America is STILL in debt $35 trillion dollars.

And for all you billionaires are this and that types like Bernie Sanders. 
Remember this. If we were to round up and confiscate every dime from all billionaires in America, it would only put a small dent in the national debt. Not to mention all the workers that billionaires employ would no longer be paying taxes after losing their jobs.

"Mr. Musk is in a position to be a great influence on things, in good ways, and in bad. I appreciate that he came from humble beginnings, and has been through his share of hardships. He has worked very hard to overcome things in his life, and earn the success he has had. Great successes takes great sacrifices for some people, he is one of them. Everyone should be held to an equal standard of expectations, to work hard, and persevere despite their challenges. Everything I've heard about the work that he, and the DOGE team are doing sounds right, and fair.  But, I hope he can practice empathy with the flawed, weak, disabled, mislead, lost people etc. ... We've all been in broken systems, in a broken society for a long time. It's hard to overcome these things, most people don't. I haven't read, or heard anything that makes me think he is a Christian man, that does make me uneasy, as I am a Christian. I believe leadership of our country is best in the hands of fellows Christians. My prayers are with Mr. Musk, the DOGE team, President Trump, and the rest of the people working with them though.

"Speaking of Social Security,
Here’s what really happened,
WHO TOOK MY MONEY?
﻿

Actually, Democrat President Kennedy and Sergeant Shriver were the first ones to misuse the Social Security account.  They used Social Security funds to start the Peace Corps.   Not the first or last time our money has been taken from American citizens and given to foreign nations.
 
Things every US citizen should know and remember about Social Security and changes made:
 
A History Lesson on Your Social Security Card . . . Just in case some of you young whippersnappers (& some older ones) didn't know this.   It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it   Be sure and show it to your family and friends.   They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican . . .
Facts are Facts

Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and card were not to be used for identification purposes.   Since nearly everyone in the United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message, NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION, was removed.
 
Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program.
He promised:

1.) That participation in the Program would be Completely voluntary.
No longer Voluntary

2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual Incomes into the Program.
Now 7.65% on the first $90,000.

3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year.
No longer tax deductible

4.) That the money the participants put into the independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program.
Under Democrat President Johnson the money was moved to the General Fund and Spent.

5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income.
Under Democrats Clinton & Gore Up to 85% of your Social Security can be Taxed.

Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away' -- you may be interested in the following:

Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it?
A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically controlled House and Senate.
 
Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding?
A: The Democrat Party.
 
Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities?
A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the US

Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants?
A: That's right!   Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party.   Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments!   The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it!

Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away!
 
And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it!
If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve.

But it's worth a try.
 
How many people can YOU send this to?
Actions speak louder than bumper stickers.
 
PLEASE DO KEEP THIS ONE ROLLING ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

THESE FEDERAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN GETTING A TAX PAYER FEDERAL PAY CHECK!

IS BECAUSE ELECTIONS ARE TAKEN AND STOLEN, AND WE ARE ALL KEPT DIVIDED AND FORCED TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH OUR OWN PERSONAL SITUATIONS AND PROBLEMS AND COSTS OF LIVING, AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH ALL THAT EVERY DAY.. THAT WE CANT POSSIBLY STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT, GOING ON WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT!  WHICH LEAVES ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO WORK DIRECTLY IN GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO!    : /     AND THEY HAVE ALL CREATED AND HAVE PROTECTED THE ""SWAMP"" THAT HAS BECOME AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS!

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO TELL ATTORNEY PAM BONDI  TO LET ALL THE STATES GOVERNORS KNOW, THAT EVERY STATE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE, RESPECT, SUPPORT, ABIDE BY, PROTECT, AND ENFORCE, THE US CONSTITUTION, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS FOR ALL THE CITIZENS OF EVERY STATE IN THE UNION!!!!  THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  ALL OF THESE THINGS BEING DONE IN WASHINGTON , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AROUND THE WORLD,  ARE GREAT!   BUT AMERICA NEEDS FUNDAMENTAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT HERE IN ALL OF THE STATES WHERE ALL AMERICANS LIVE!   THE LARGE NUMBERS OF VIOLENT CRIME, AND ALL KINDS OF CRIME IN GENERAL ARE ONLY GETTING MORE OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE IN MOST STATES, THE STATE GOVERNOR AND THE REST OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT RESPECTING, SUPPORTING, ABIDING BY OR ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE.. OR SPECIFICALLY THE 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DEFEND AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER!!!!!!  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!  WHEN THIS RIGHT IS ENFORCED? AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAN DEFEND AND PROTECT THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER WHEN NECESSARY???  THIS WILL SAVE A LOT OF GOOD LIVES, END A LOT OF BAD LIVES, AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE ALL THE VIOLENT AND OTHER CRIMES IN THAT STATE!!!!!   SO PLEASE MAKE ALL THE GOVERNORS AWARE THAT IF THEY DO NOT START ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION IN THEIR STATE?????

Your tweaks are vindictive BS sound like a child, and you dare complain about the radical left? You have brought the hate on yourself and therefore deserve it.

"A Word of Caution to Musk Fans: Progress Must Not Come at the Cost of Humanity

I was once an ardent supporter of Elon Musk—a visionary who pushed technology forward like no other. But over time, the cracks in the narrative became impossible to ignore.

The promise of free speech on X turned out to be an illusion, with Musk himself suppressing criticism while artificially amplifying his own voice. Worse, his political shift toward far-right extremism, racist rhetoric, and outright fascist sympathies revealed a disturbing side of his leadership.

What truly alarms me, however, is his reckless, sledgehammer approach to power. His cozy relationship with Putin’s Russia, his willingness to cut off Starlink access for Ukrainians in their fight for survival—these are not the actions of a principled innovator, but of a bully with little regard for the vulnerable.

Technological advancement should never come at the expense of democracy, equality, or basic human decency. As fans of progress, we must demand better—because unchecked power in the hands of any one individual is a danger to us all.",[],2025-03-28T04:16:51Z,@EVcharging-v2n

If they are democrats: How long have the republicans been trying to eliminate social security? 
If they are a republicans: How long have the democrats been saying the republicans are trying to eliminate Social Security?

"I appreciate this interview, finally seeing and hearing from some of the DOGE staff besides Elon and the tech youngsters and hearing some of the process. However, I still feel that a lot of public distrust and angst could have been avoided by Musk and company  by presenting their approach and plans to the WHOLE Congress, not just the GOP, before they touched any systems and entered any buildings. Seeing the tech youngsters muscle their way into buildings with US Marshalls and shut down buildings and start laying people off without any notice, and giving false reasons for firing people...which is not legal....did NOT help matters. Why does it all have to be done in 130 days?...the rushing leads to errors and adds to mistrust. Clinton balanced the budget and laid off lots of gov employees but did it by consulting with Congress and at a slower pace that was less traumatizing. Vought of OMB wrote in Project 2025 that he wanted to traumatize the federal work force....that was not a helpful stance.  Lutnick of Commerce's arrogant  statement that only fraudsters would complain about a missed Social Security payment only adds to the distrust and appearance of the Trump admin being out of touch with the average citizen.

These fellas are lying to you.,"['They are lying that our gov is ran very inefficiently and is corrupt?  😂', '@malachi-no! That part is true. But this interview had very few specifics and was rather vague. If we’re talking about DOGES specific claims about money they have saved, then yes they are lying to you.', '@ Did you hear them talk about being open and showing records?', '@malachi- I did, yes. Saying their aim is to be honest and transparent is one thing but they are either lying, obfuscating, or confused about their claims. For example, no one else (other than DOGE itself) is able to corroborate the amount they claim that they’ve saved (DOGE website says $130 billion saved as of 3/28/2025). In fact, they’ve made it harder to keep track of some government spending by removing contracts that they’ve canceled from any government website (such as the USAID contracts). Their alleged “wall of receipts” is fraught with errors such as these and they are constantly removing and adding correct/incorrect information to it. Until other sources can verify their claims, DOGE should be suspect. If you are like me and wary of corruption, waste, and mismanagement, why not apply that same sentiment to DOGE?', ""@apdbr9 I do, but they have not even hardly started, you are tightening the leash and they are just now sniffing around, you seem to have a particular goal in mind, and not in their favor.\n\nAnybody that is for more Fed Gov has got issues.\n\nIt is our job to keep the gov in line, no?\n\nBut that's the problem, it has been out of control long before we were ever born.\n\nTheir whole job is to cut back on ridiculous waste and inefficiency, you would think you would be pumped about learning just how bad things are on the inside and want to help make it all even more public.""]",2025-03-28T03:56:31Z,@anthonybalzarini-leonhart8562

Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party.

Why is it that only the rich can win in this Trump administration while important programs that we the middle class and poor Americans depend on are ended or severely cut so that money is leftover for the Billionaire tax breaks.

"These men all look older than the 18-19 year old, uneducated, unqualified teens the left says they all are. How anyone can be mad at someone for saving their tax dollars and potentially reducing their tax burden, along with their future security benefits, is beyond me.
I do this on a local government scale and, while my budget is in the multi millions, I am audited and responsible for fractions of pennies spent. If I’m off .004 of one cent, my job is on the line until I find the discrepancy. The odd thing is, people at the local level seem to understand this concept and will call requesting documentation of our audits. Meaning, they want proof of how the audit went. Those same people calling my office are the ones also on Facebook complaining about DOGE and the waste they’re finding. These people also receive print outs after each budget meeting with intent to buy or sell, as well as, receipts of each transaction.

The only difference: they can’t wrap their head around federal spending being so much more deceptive and misleading, and on a MUCH bigger scale. They don’t have media filling their heads with ridiculous ideology and pushing agendas.
A multi TRILLION dollar budget should be FAR more meticulously audited and scrutinized, in my humble opinion.",[],2025-03-28T03:39:44Z,@Lace71421

"DOGE ... will not only drain the Swamp in the USA. It will also be used to allow them access to all information on all businesses and citizens in the USA.

The collection of information can then   be masterfully altered with no fear of being successfully investigated for decades. 
Their intent is malicious and to use/or not use .. this altered information on all unsuspecting victims as a valuable   bargaining tool to sway persuasion to an outcome that they favor.

Starting in America first. Then in time  eventually globally. 
Strong arming one country at a time with all types of disingenuous tactics through the expertise use of A.I. Armed with this powerful technology advantage. They will then threaten, black-mail all into surrendering to them willingly. 

This will eventually enable and attain  their goals. 

Which is ... ""One World Order""??","['This sounds a bit too negative. USA will slowly (or speedily) decay in corruption if DOGE does not reach its goal. So it\'s a great thing! (You should not be overly skeptical. Leave some room for an almighty God who will give the USA a certain ""reprieve"" through the current administration. It will depend on whether the US and the West in general will return to God or not, whether our civilization will stand. At the moment, this does not look good, but the US has better chances than Europe). \n\nOf course, if those in power now have ulterior motives (and are secretly plotting for evil), we are all cooked, but why would you assume that is the case? It seems rather the opposite: evil people WERE in power, and this election was probably the last realistic chance to make a difference before the USA would collapse. \n\nThis can be a first great start and will hopefully be emulated in Europe and other areas.']",2025-03-28T03:27:05Z,@gordonsamuels4878

"I disagree with Musk on his “propaganda” comment and how they are to blame for the fire-bombing of Teslas. No. The fire- bombers themselves must take personal responsibility for this. It is THEIR fault. But whatever. . . 

Also, I love making fun of the Tesla. But NEVER would I advocate anyone to harm Mr Musk’s Tesla, his X program, his satellite company nor his spaceship. I actually like the  dude. I’ve come to his defense more than once. In fact, my sister has a Tesla. It’s a magnificent car. More quiet than my cat going into a garage. But I just can’t resist teasing Musk. He’s sincere, successful, cute, surprising, brave, intelligent, fun and a better dancer than the President (Shhh, don’t tell him). And his products really are excellent (especially that satellite service).

You want an example of how Social Security works? I retired in May of 2022 and in January of this year my social security check was $170 short. I called Social Security and they passed me to Medicare. I was on the phone for 2 hours with Social Security trying to get through their automated system and speak to a person. They directed me to Medicare. Said the problem was there. The initial call I made was in February and I was told that Medicare messed up and they would send me the shortage on my next check. It didn't come on my next check or the check in March. I called Medicare back and was on the phone with them for an hour and was told they couldn't figure it out and they would have an auditor call me within the next 7 days. The auditor called back the next day and he said that the 170.00 that I was short was from when I initially signed up for Social Security in 2022 and that Medicare had forgot to take my first installment out of my first social security check. It took them almost a full 3 years to catch this. I didn't get a letter of explanation or anything that would tell me why they took the money out. At this point I had to take their word because I have no way to go back 3 years and find out what happened on my first social security check. I would say the system needs to be updated,[],2025-03-28T03:01:00Z,@williambuffington1940

Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party.

Elon thinks what he's done is making the government more efficient no it hasn't but it has done is it's made most Americans  scared shitless! I'm serious now Social Security is being attacked by the Republicans and Trump and Elon also Medicare and Medicaid. I put into Social Security just like everybody else except for people that made over $10 million like Elon hasn't put any money into Social Security and all his Rich Buddies they should have to do that. So what's going to happen when your grandmother or your grandfather or your brother that's disabled doesn't get the social security check? Howard  lug nuts thinks it's not going to be a big deal if the little old ladies have to eat dog food for a month or you're disabled brother can't get around the house because there's no money to pay for the caregiver or your your grandfather in the old folks home has been thrown out onto the street because Medicaid has been defunded. This is real life boys and girls. Elon doesn't care their house in the Senate Republicans don't care about your father or mother or  disabled relative let him die I've heard that from Republicans. Well see they don't understand that there's almost a hundred million Americans to get the service that paid into this and if they don't get their check all hell's going to break a loose you think January 6th was bad wait until a little old ladies with Molotov cocktails, marching and they can throw real good.",[],2025-03-28T02:57:12Z,@coolhand6669

"What a great Interview ! Thinking back over the past few years, I have to conclude that there once was a special feeling about being an American, we didn't stand on a pedestal looking down at others that needed help. An American, looks down and then reaches out a hand to help other Americans and extends the offer to all.  That's not done by not having a moral compass and giving the appearance of helping,  Elon Musk has the  Moral conviction that as an American we just do what needs to be done, Americans are still very capable of doing the right thing.

"For decades, democrats have set animosity between the American businesses/enterprises and the public, forgetting that “the business is the American way”. The business is what keeps the economy going and operates the government. Without the business there would be no employment. It’s a simple mechanism that defines the economy and the strength of the country. No logic involved. All are common sense. But seems as if even the common sense ideas are complex logic for illiterate democrats. 

To bring back the American pride and treasures, you have to enhance the businesses and provide them every opportunity to grow and expand and be productive and successful. When companies rise, the employees rise along. The businesses create jobs and eliminate the unemployment. But even that much is too much for democrats to comprehend. 

For those Democrats who are hindering and preventing the businesses from prospering, must be subjected to the medieval systems of justice. That is my decree for democrats.",[],2025-03-28T02:41:07Z,@Pure-Lucidity

"Medicare (Correction, it was United Healthcare, and Medicare plan F) had my dad on two different programs simultaneously for several months before it was found out. To the tune of over $2,000 overcharge. They refuse to pay him back and he has spent months trying to get to one program. I spent over 20 hours in phone calls, many many workers, including 2 supervisors and they still did not straighten it in. In the meantime neither program would pay his bills because of the other one. Finally after 6 months he told them he would get a lawyer. Their response was to purge his record. I am stunned at what they have put this 97 year old man through, the money he has lost and the stress both my parents have had to endure ( my mother is 94). This has traumatized them. Thank you Doge team and President Trump for tackling this nightmare government mess!","[""This all began when my mother tried to use the advantage stipend card they were alotted for personal items purchased. Walgreens pharmacist was rude and said she had zero balance, so she put it on credit card. Later the statement from Advantage showed he was paid and her credit card statement showed the same amount for the same day. Advantage refused to listen and was also rude to her and said she has zero balance and I believe hung up on her, even though she told them she had a receip from both that matched. This is what led them to go back to the F plan, when they discovered that my dad was never disenrolled when they enrolled him in advantage. They have deep regrets from listening to the smooth talking salesman that got them to switch in the first place. The same guy that they could never get in touch with again.

I'm a QA Test ""Executive"" - which just means I've done software testing for a VERY long time. If these guys are trying to fix these problems then they're going to need real requirements and workflow definitions.  So far... all I keep hearing is ""We'll fix these problems with better designs."" Those designs must be based on business requirements, workflow and clearly defined use cases.  Further... since these will effect government systems that impact... well... EVERYBODY. They're going to need to comply with ISO standards and I'm not just talking 9001. Anyway. I like what they're doing and I definitely am all for it.

His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\r\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \r\nSources:\r\nBBC World\r\nNews\r\nReuters""]",2025-03-28T02:07:19Z,@sole__doubt

"Elon’s comment about media propaganda is the real cause of the attacks against Tesla is 100% spot on.  If you are a democrat or liberal progressive I’m sure this is hard for you to hear.  Most of you are much younger than me.  I have worked for DoD for over 30 years.  I’m a Cold War baby and also a witness to the Global War on Terror.  I’ve tried to objectively look at the world and even voted for Obama the first time.  I had high hopes for him but ultimately his policies and those of his democrat party prove to me they only wanted power and their state goal of fundamentally transforming America wasn’t for the better.  In fact I believe they intentionally attempted to weaken the United States.  They are still attempting this with a disregard for truth.  I’ve learned with time and perspective that we as a people are being deceived, not in an obvious way but in a long term systemic way to slowly degrade and weaken our society.  We are a bastion of individual liberty and freedom but there are many who naively believe in collective socialism with a hope of some future benevolent oligarchs.  Ultimately humans always work to their own self interest.  That is why it is so important to have a limited government based on capitalist principles.  Morals are also important which is why it is so dangerous to strip away value based religions.  My point is the liberal left and Democratic Party has lost its way and it’s highly probable their propaganda mainstream media is intentionally trying to weaken the United States  with socialist ideology masquerading as benevolent liberalism.  Today’s Democratic Party is a corrupt and destructive ideology which should be voted out of power.",[],2025-03-28T01:54:12Z,@mikecox803

I wager it’s not random radicalized people firebombing Tesla. It’s too intense to be normal people. It must be the criminals and fraudsters that have been systematically scamming various government systems to the tune of trillions of dollars. They’re getting their scams chopped off at the knees by DOGE. Those people are the ones capable of firebombing. Are they hoping to intimidate DOGE into stopping their work? And the left leaning media strangely skews reports towards justifying the anger. It’s asinine.,[],2025-03-28T01:51:11Z,@DouglasKvanDuyne

He is not helping the government at all. People have to understand Systems are one thing but trying to use the right system, and keeping your data safe is whole another ball park. Just Google how Japan works an keep their data safe. Japan mostly use paper for everything and its 2025, they haven't had a data breach in years. The USA want everything fast and cry when their SSN get stolen or their banking account wiped out due to scammers. Learn how things work before commenting on what is happening with ELON ...

Personally, I'd like to see each of the DoGE team members given a bonus or $10M, minimum. It would mean nothing to Elon, but to the regular people doing all of this work, and having to endure the slings and arrows from the communists, it would be a very well-deserved paycheck. Hell Trump could even initiate his equivalent of a GoFundMe project to get taxpayers like me to voluntarily pay for it. Each IRS form has a checkbox to let you deduct $3 for Presidential elections. How about another checkbox, this one for a $10 deduction that goes to the DoGE bonus kitty? I'd gladly do it!

The American government has been acting like a business since the constitution it isn't even part of the USA the people who live there dont have representation or able to vote it's a country within a country that's why it's been hiding corruption ever since. USA might have changed the laws of their country with a constitution but they didn't change the laws of the land and Britain has legal documents that are older than than the constitution that they likely still have rights to a lot more than Americans know just like in Canada we just didnt lie to our people about where the debt was going,[],2025-03-28T01:32:12Z,@ScRaMbLeS247

I think any decent citizen would love the opportunity to stop wasteful spending in the government.  Now that we have somebody who is trying to set the record to do just that there is opposition from those who want to continue the gravy train and keep it in place.  I commend the people who are readily trying to keep this country intact and all the freedoms we are allowed to enjoy.  These protestors that threaten business and workers should be ashamed of themselves.  My thanks to all who are sacrificing to make our country more secure and prosperous for the future.  This is very important because taking something for granted could be all gone and wiped away.  That is not right as many people died to build the US up to what it is today. Some things not nice but one outweighs the other.  There is no reason to understand those who wish to tear it apart as it is wiser to make sure they cannot.

Read deeper about the damage his action can have, don’t just be brainwashed like he is some god. I feel like a lot of people who are either far right or left are very guilty of confirmation bias.

"Our country has become overrun by corrupt politicians attempting to expose other supposedly corrupt politicians, all the while it’s really just part of their giant shell game. Look here not there.. First what happened to JFK? Does anybody know? Oh that’s right it was the CIA and some other foreign countries who had an interest. Why was that? Oh I don’t know.. Who did it?? Oh I don’t care.. Next we have the Epstein files. Who’s on those? Oh I don’t care Why’s that? Oh it doesn’t matter… this is all of course unless it supposedly has to do with tar and feathering politicians on either side of the isle. We are so behind the 8 ball as a country let alone as a species. But sure let’s cut 1 trillion of our 21+ trillion deficit not like any of it matters as interest rates climb prices increase all the while general wages stay the same and that’s if you can find a job to begin with. Not to mention endless wars, destitute poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, crime among many other issues that we will not fix even 1% no matter how many trillions we cut in our country. It’s over folks and we might as well face it. Anyone who argues otherwise has been rightfully indoctrinated probably on their own accord. They wouldn’t have it any other way and think they are on the winning side and that is good enough for them.

As a retired civil servant that worked as a researcher and program manager for the US government I can attest to the archaic technology and money management within the government.   The government does not upgrade or change procedures easily and it was always an uphill battle to correct obvious faults in any system. I saw places where equipment and  technology that was old and being used 40 years ago  when I started working was still in place and in use when I retired. Managing funding according to procedure  often  turned out 3 times  more expensive and illogical then what would have made sense.  Trying to fix things did not make me very popular with upper management.,[],2025-03-28T00:56:55Z,@badbob6689

Many of them are only in thd office certain days,  or a couple of times monthly. So getting an appointment to resolvd things is impossible.

"Two trillion dollar deficits started under trumps first term.  During Obama we had it down to 650 billion dollars in deficit.  Bush started the trillion dollar deficits..  Obama followed suit but it did go down (not because of him but because forced sequestration)...  It started increasing during Obama's final years again.  Then president Trump increased the deficit again until ultimately it sky rocketed due to covid spending.   Biden pretty well continued that spending trend and even increased it post covid (which is crazy)...    

Make no mistake;  cutting only a trillion dollars and spending six trillion dollars is in no way what a small constitutional government looks like.   Spending needs to be cut to 4 trillion dollars and revenue needs to be 6 trillion so we can start beating back the national debt.    Elon and musk are proposing a trillion dollar deficit.  You can't get rid of debt by deficit spending.",[],2025-03-28T00:26:27Z,@lawrenceshdow

"Enron Musk & tRUmp don't care about the debt...
The IRS has been falling behind tax cheats for years, mainly because Republicans cut the agency’s budget whenever they have control of Congress. There’s an annual “tax gap” — the amount of money people owe that the IRS fails to collect — of nearly $700 billion. That’s an enormous amount of money, almost equivalent to the whole Pentagon budget.

Cutting 7,000 IRS staffers would save about $7 billion in personnel costs over a decade, but lead to $71 billion in foregone tax revenue. That’s $64 billion added to the national debt.

Cutting 50,000 staffers would save $45 billion in personnel costs over a decade while cutting the amount of collected tax revenue by $323 billion. That’s $286 billion added to the national debt.
