Thank you for sharing your life with me Elon.  Our lives are so different but still feel we have become friends.  Just met a man who will take Tesla and me to the vet after I tried to cancel his appointment and the woman at the vets called me back and gave me his number.  Just called him and told him the vet gave me his number because someone in office had his information and thought he could help me.  After we chatted and he agreed to get me there on Monday, July 7th by 8:30am, I had to call vet then we could talk a bit.  I confirmed date with vet and called Rick back.  He retired from army, lives on West side of Kingsport, I'm  on the East side, and is single with 2 aged cats and 2 dogs, one is older and he took in a puppy after his other older dog passed a year ago.  Tesla needs some friends to get him moving.  He would do well with the puppy, and would be kind to the old ones.  Now I'm  anxious to finish your video and learn wh e re your son is.  You keep surprising me!  Thank you! / []

Both Elon and Trump got the gullible and naive, oh so happy to see them "fall apart" losers exactly where they want them to be right now - assured and celebrating their "victory" (in reality they did nothing, Trump and Elon did, would;n; that itself be telling and suspicious s to anyone with a little bit of brain)..  nope, Dems jumped right away in joy, as expected... they lost that privilege called the right-to-use some common sense, have some backbone and the brain to use - long time ago, when evil took over).  How many times have I seen these sore losers loving the evil ways to achieve their insidious goals through lies, accusations etc... like the eyes of that crazy Clinton witch right before she lost that election, scared me.. for real..   Only to result in Trump getting bigger and stronger... this is because most REAL Americans are no dummies and have not been for a while now...   Dems would want them to be and still believe they are, which shows their true faces AND CONTEMPT FOR THE MINORITIES THEY CLAIM TO BE HELPING AND "ON THEIR SIDE" WHILE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE all along..  Of course, the "minorities" growing up in the ghettos for decades in all these Dem ran cities, are street smart, if nothing...  So they see BS from a mile away and have been sick and tired of it for too long now.. they are now of course, preferring the other side, Dems are killing themselves every timer they open their evil lying mouths..  without even realizing..  the hole gets deeper..Soliciting for votes through cheap subsidies etc..! Shameful...  Obviously, dummies are and have always been the crazy, loud and "for the people" bs lefties, while the silent and the wise choose accordingly and get things done.   Musk and Trump NEVER fell apart, its all part of the show they put up just for shits and gigglez and in which they will of course make BILLIONS in just a a few days,why do you think Tesla shares fell so low... time to buy .. and they are(or will be soon), back up now, and about to go over..   Bedsides, why would Elon "go against" the president of the country in which his biz is based and expanding, he prefers such a person on his side, strictly biz talking wise, to help his business interests and this is what he does and gets (like the SpaceX city being official, so the launches skip the FAA control and can be done as many times as they desire with no oversight and conditions... ), this is a big deal even if not obvious..  Not to mention, on the other end (Trump) you need a guy with rockets (reusable at that)_ on your side. lots of stuff can be put on those, and then tell the bold tough guys on Earth to beware really...   Ruskies on the other hand would send donkeys for now.. or prisoner drunks as astronauts.. while Chinese can only send what they can steal and copy.. and steal this they will not!   Moreover, why would Trump lose Elon, over some "words  said" and egos hurt... who takes care of a lot of things Trump now does not have to, bur can focus on other issues.. he needs Elon and similar people of course, who privately develop things for the US Government which would spend ten times as much and ten times as long to achieve.. they always needed each other, and continue to be the case...  On the other end, while sad, its hilarious playing these career politicians aka democrats who NEVER ever did anything to HELP the demos in their titles, nor develop anything useful for the humanity.. but took the money to run themselves and secure their reason to exist aka jobs, instead of fixing the issue they claim they would fix (and never did or do..) / ['Omdg']

Many years ago when I was young, I had a bad case of the stupids. I was far away from God. In early adulthood, some1 was praying for me, because I had a POWERFUL CONVERSION!    In the 1990's, I was in a chaplet in Arkansas & (I believed it was The Lord), a voice spoke to me & said, "Would you agree to quit smoking?" I said, "Yes.". Then, after a period of time passed, the same Person asked me if I would agree to be celibate for the rest of my life? I said, "Yes." (It's ok. I'll know they're trying to finish me off, when they ask me to give up chocolate. LOL). Anyway, I have been celibate, living as a nun, since the 1990's. I belong to The Lord. So, I don't care if you're the richest, most handsome guy in the world. YOU CAN'T HAVE ME! My riches - & my Husband - are in Heaven. Then I received Prophecies. #1. I will be taken up into Heaven. #2. The President will be assassinated. There are more, but when Pres. Trump was in office back in 2016, I told him, "As long as I am alive, YOU ARE SAFE."  But I get frustrated sometimes; Pres. Trump can't stop cursing. Elon can't say, "Jesus Christ is Lord." & Thom Homan says he's bringing hell with him.  WE DON'T NEED HELL! WE NEED HEAVEN! WE NEED GOD / []

Another thing that needs to be DOGED is the presidential library system.  These places are built by private funds but are maintained under the National Park system by taxpayers.  According to the internet,  they cost $100 million per year to maintain. They employ people,  and more jobs are created every year.  The cost to maintain these things goes up a lot every year.  I suggest that beginning with President #51, the taxpayers no longer support the new libraries. We can continue to support the first 50 as long as they are audited every year and keep costs below a specified level, but NO NEW LIBRARIES  to be taxpayer supported. This is ridiculous.  A new president every 4-8 years. We do not owe them an eternal monument to themselves. They are CEOs of a country,  not gods or monarchs.  If we start with President #51, and write the legislation now, no person or political party would have to feel singled out or offended.  Enough already. / []
Thank you President Trump, Thank You Elon Musk, Thank you All of Doge!! We thank each one of you for the future of my grand children !!! / []
Stop spending our tax dollars on the black ops operations that we don’t even know what and stop feeding serial killers in jails, instead of cutting jobs that are needed / []

Thank  You DOGE!   I believe it.  I hate that the Democrats are able to lie to the American people saying that President Trump, Elon Musk and the DOGE team are stealing the Socail Security.  Why are they allowed  do this? / []

And the democrats don't like Elon and DOGE. 🤔 / []
AI and UBI = slavery = communism = fascism.  The Bolshevik revolution 2.0 on steroids.  Please don’t believe the hype, as you heard nothing from the foreigners mouth about being “patriotic”.  He doesn’t care about Americans, because he wouldn’t be trying to take their jobs away and replace them with robots, never!  Neither the democrats nor the republicans care about common Americans.  We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but demons cloaked as humans. / []

The servers and hard drives, it should still be. It's stored inside of Iron Mountain with the rest of them. The things that are supposed to last beyond a catastrophic event. Nuclear war is not the only thing, the thing that is in the forecast Volcano. Eruptions, Earthquakes. Category five or more hurricanes, among anything else that might be man made. It is almost like that keeping a census of those who have served in multiple ways. Efficiency, it's great, a digital vault, you can never take the place of a hardened physical. Shelter in a secure location. A physical small drives in storage can take the place of the extended amount of paperwork beyond the normal system. / []

The end result of Doge was a surprise. After their thorough review given total access to computer records of spending by federal departments. It turned out that the majority of the spending is necessary and honest. The problem is not the spending authorized by Congress but the income from taxes. Where else can funds be found to balance the budget? / []

At the end of this video where Elon Musk said there are those virtue signaling but have no plan to end the war and the killing. When he asked what was the killing for and his voice raised a bit it was clear his anger about the war. A song from the 70's asked about war. What is it good for...absolutely nothing. Well, it's good for those who make the weapons of war. They make money if there's war. There may be good reasons for some wars but not many. Things could be solved without war in most cases I believe. / []
Great interview and great work at Doge. I dont completely understand Musks view on the Ukraine war though. They have been invanded by Russia who wants to take over their entire country. For what? They fight to have a country to live in. When the Americans fought the British for independence, should we have said - "fight the British, for what? Just let them rule us". When the Persians invaded Greece and Leonidas wanted to fight them to defend their homeland, should we have said -"fight the Persians, for what? Just let them take our land". On that part I dont agree. / []

What are the chances that these are his(Trump) intentions He wants a moral and ethic code similar to that of Americans He wants HARDworking people(yes I know all races have hard working people) The people must not have extremist ideology Preferably follow one of the Christian religions He wants qualified, able bodied with a workable lifespan people Hetrosexual family oriented people Farmers, farmers to make the USA a primary exporter of food-so to say the global bread basket. He wants erectors not destructors He does NOT want riff raff, vagrants, jannie jammer gat type, charity cases or the useless. Using white farmers is a tactic against the ruling party, take away the food and force them to their knees. / []

The new york times has checked and analyzed doge and have found that doge lies about many of their cuts. The amount of money that is cut is often much lower than they show on their site, in some cases its even 0 dollars because the money was already spent and there are many contract cuts that are even revived. Their biggest cut was on homeland security, they claimed to have cut 8 billion but it was actually 8 million. And there are many more examples. There are also many example on contracts that are revived, for example the contract cut with the department of veterans affairs. Additionally, musk has made it increasingly harder to track the cuts that are made after the investigations even though he claims to be very transparent. / []

Ok so those of us who actually are disabled are being denied right now because we would litterally have to be homeless level poor to qualify. This is supposed to be based on disability, not income level standards that are rediculous. We are barely affording grocieries. Also, sometimes having paperwork keeps corruption and digital attacks from happening. Like AI having access to all of that data is not a wise thing. You could also talk about the corruption in the VMB loosing all of our finger prints and wanting us to pay to retest, or that they're trying to do away with common practice and exceptions to regulations that are what allow the whole veterinary system to be run by drs and techs instead of beurocracy. / []

I believe everything they're saying one thing I do believe the people that don't believe them no matter what you say to them they're not going to change their minds so don't try to change somebody's mind that hates them. someday when DOGE start showing results of what they're doing and the results come back great you're going to start seeing people deny that they hated it at the beginning. it reminds me of Biden when ran for president a lot of people voted for him but when we realized that he's was screwing up the whole country not one of those people in our country admitted that they voted for him nobody wanted to tell anybody that they voted for him but nobody admitted it. I believe I going to be like this with DOGE everybody's going to b**** and moan about what's going on but when the results come back not one person is going to admit that they were against it / []

And there you have it. These guys find a fund that does not require receipts and see somehow that large conference halls in hotels have been rented. And Elon jumps to “they are using it for parties.”  And that is what he says on X and Fox. Without a shred of proof.  Now where do you think a federal organization would hold a conference or training session for a national audience? Gee, a hotel.  These guys did not follow up and check, they did not ask the reason for the fund nor where the funds were used. So they CONJECTURE “parties” because that’s what they would do.  And Elon runs with it. / []
❤️DOGE🤍💙 should be a permanent job / []

I will take Doge more seriously when (and if) the Doge team looks into all the shenanigans of Trump, his family, and his inner circle—especially regarding alleged market manipulations resulting from Trump's on-and-off tariff applications.  What say you, Elon? / []
If i remember well, Sir Winston Churchill said something similar to the following : "  Never in the field of Human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few ! " Now we can say something similar about DOGE : " Never in some  Human Dishonesty in Frauds,  is so much owed by so many Americans to so few Americans  in DOGE  for the discovery of so many Frauds and Wastes ! "  By the way, i was the first one to mention that President Trump has so much Common Sense. Another time, I mentioned that President Trump has the DNA of a true President. Blessings to the New Golden Age of  America. / []
This was fantastic!  I learned a lot about what is changing. And no fear for the future if they continue to fix the government! / []
THESE EVILS NEED TO BE DEAD AND SUICIDE IS ONE WAY BUT THEY ARE TOO COWARDS TO DO THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA GOD IS COMING FOR THEM AND EVEN SATAN HAS THE SENSE TO FEAR THE LORD!!!       Love always Kelli / []

Thank you doge 🚀🚀 / []
What the DOGE team is doing has been needed for a long time.  Thank You DOGE team and President Trump and his team. / []
Don't forget me.  They chged my birthdate and said I needed 3 orig. Birth Certificates.  They chged my BD on Israeli Embassy too.  They held my cks for 4 months and  When reembursed they did not give ck for month pd.  I guess they wanted to see if I still have my marbles.  Being 71 yrs old with difficulties walking, getting BC is not only expensive for a retiree without other income, never mind going to Tel Aviv is difficult from the heartland.  That ck would be helpful. / []
And now the Pentagon has the balls to tell us that Russia is the number one threat to our country and they need another trillion dollars so they can still half of it again / []
Thank you Doge team  Thank you Elon for all you do for the people of America, I -we appreciate you in every which way, you donated your time with no pay / []
When are we gonna call DOGE for what it truly is? All musk is doing is destroying all the “non-profits” that democrats have used for years to fund their party. They are trying to cripple the democrats so they can’t effectively run against the republicans/billionaires / []
Thank you DOGE / []
On a daily basis 10 times a day, I received phone calls from insurance companies trying to sell me insurance in Florida and get me on medicare and medicaid.They even try to get me on social security , which I have been on 2013 / []
Elon's exactly right Florida's computers didn't talk to Texas.I still get phone calls from Texas for my medicare and medicaid.Insuparents after I view to texas after a year / []
I think ai is going to be a big problem for social security / []
They should not be able to change their social security banking and routing number on the telephone.If the worker is allowing that then they should be fired.I had to go to the social security office.Personally or do it online on my secure online port hole / []
Love DOGE. Thanks for helping America get great again. / []
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE IN DOGE FOR HELPING OUR COUNTRY!! / []
Thank you Doge for supporting the president and the people of the U. S.  Of America. / []
patardugno; Exactly, the anger, verbal & physical attacks. The reaction that is completely unwilling to be reasonable or accept any new positive info in a good calm way. They are the most guilty. / []

The money scams are generated through these ads on YouTube! Where they say call in and get your card! There are around 13 of those different ads. They’ve been running for a two years you call to see if you qualify, and they will mind all your data and then run with that to create these fake accounts and to swindle you out of your money through Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and anything else! Somebody needs to address this an outlaw these ads / []
25. You made this so entertaining, incredible job on the video! / []
HALLELUJAH! THANK YOU DOGE! We the people appreciate all you are doing to bring justice to our Social Security! / []

Wow all so crazy that this happened under any president- so sad but NOW  hopefully being fixed. / []
So why with all this waste, is there no program to help a 55 yr old woman, who has been displaced since Covid, no children at home, homeless most of that time and not one Covid payment! / []
LEAVE TRUMP  & MUSK ALONE  THEY ARE TRYING  TO MAKE AMERICA  GREAT AGAIN. 🎉❤ / []
In Md they have stopped taking applications for purchase of care which helps families with child care .. it’s a federal program carried out by the states education dept …,don’t know if the whole program will be taken or not …. It’s scary and it’s not like the program is only for the very poor it’s for working class families and for many it’s the only break they get .. / []
To some extent, it's about the approach , not the truth. / []
I believe that these younger kids, 11 and under, are not really kids, their animals. A lady once told me she made a credit card account for her cat and got it ! / []
A couple of years ago, statistics came out that said thieves and robbers stole $1.7 Billion of US citizens assets. The same year, police stole $2.4 Billion of citizens assets via programs like Civil Asset Forfeiture, outright theft, and other scams done on the public. / []

Trump can’t fix the system because the system IS designed to accommodate exceptions of those in the “entitled and privileged division”.

Elon Musk did not succeed in a vacuum. In America, we are inclined to celebrate the heroic individual entrepreneur while ignoring – and even downplaying – that massive public support was the foundation of their success. Consider the iPhone: nearly all of its core technologies, from GPS and touchscreen displays to the internet itself, were publicly funded. Covid vaccines and the pharmaceutical industry, too, have relied heavily on NIH-funded research.  And yet, Musk, Steve Jobs and other tech titans are cast as heroic innovators, while the state is derided as inefficient or meddlesome – even as it continues to underwrite the very innovations that fuel the economy. Further, while the risks of developing these innovations are mitigated by public funding, the profits they create are almost entirely privatized. If American taxpayers had taken equity in Tesla for their $465m investment, it is estimated such a stake would be worth over $300bn today. Instead, it is Musk alone who has enjoyed such wealth. Musk the immigrant who is milking the American tax Doller. what a joke He climbed the wealth ladder  with your money,  he is pulling up the ladder  to protect his ill gotten wealth.  Wake up, America / []

Article II. Section 9. United States Constitution.  It is a constitutional expectation fir El9n Musk to be doing what he's doing. It would have happened definitively in 1776.

That’s kind of what I’m talking about elon many of us don’t take the time to read report on things.

It’s hard to encompass it all… So all of you please slow down. I do realize that I plan on much too long, but I just had a funny thought… Our computers are not up-to-date. One doesn’t understand what the other says… Could it be that the president and Company are one computer and the regular people well, just everybody else would be another computer neither understanding what’s going on with the other… I did laugh at that thought but perhaps there’s a little of truth in it. / []

I believe cabinet meetings before April 1 were shown here and all were very informative and more cabinet meeting showed and so much information came out, and I really was interested in what everybody was saying however, it was too fast and too much information for me to take in… My suggestion is that you take each head of the committees and one by one review them and ask them what their job has accomplish… that way you can understand better what the cabinets are doing and what their jobs are and how their jobs are going… It may take more time, but it certainly would make it easier for the people to understand… I think ELON Musk‘s way of running a company is how I would like to see this country being run… Stating their job stating what they’re trying to do and stating what they have done, and how long it will be before the rest of it is done… The jobs that they have set up for themselves… so much information at one time is hard to so that is my advice and I don’t think many people would feel differently, but I don’t know. I just know that transparency and accountability is so very important and to understand and figure out what is happening I believe all the cabinets and cabinet members have to slow down and give us time to take it all in… That’s an opinion, but it’s my opinion and I’m not much different than everyone else in the United States. / []

My solution for the world.  To save everyone, we need to look at a poor family in a third world coutry. The family have no money. Have everyone around is a blessing. The parents teaches their children everything they know. The parents take care of all the children. The children helps out and learn everything they are taught in order to survive. The more everyone knows helps out the less anyone have to work. Everything is shared. Anything is made or created is share with the rest of the family. You make the best of what you have.   Now look at everything in our country and see where we go wrong. If we can be like the poor family then life would be much better for everyone. ThIs means get rid of money. Whatever you see will make the poor family life easier and better then we do that for everyone. So make everything free, teach everyone everything we need and want and have everyone produce it. We share resources and don't need to over produce everything. The more everyone know and can do the work the less we have to do the work. Make heaven/paradise on earth and fulfill everyone desire and dream. If you can think of it then lets make it happen.  That is my solution for the world. / []

Ask being a senior citizen one thing I've learned I love this investigation through the Trump administration. One thing I notice the ones that holler the loudest are always the thieves and liars. / []
So there is a saying Mr Elon, sticks and stones will hurt me but word's will never hurt me, tell them that Mr Elon. / []
Mr Elon sir is a big country 😳 and are you sure that you want to do this,,,don't give up kiddo fight with your intelligence to them and those that we called generals, God Bless you kiddo 👍. / []
I really don't feel like sharing this information 😕 because scammers out there and still in the system 😕. / []
Yes they don't have to do this however they care and God will Bless them for there jobs 🙏, it's about careness and love ❤️ and the truth is God. / []
I wish they would show the documents that prove this survey expenditure.  It says all over online that it has been debunked.  If this is inaccurate info it's extremely disappointing. / []
What oh my God, unbelievable 😳 / []
God Bless you Mr Elon 🙏 and your friends here, God will be with you, thank you Mr Bret Baire foxnews / []
God Bless them, they are smart talented and well educated 🙏 I love smart talented people, and I have a grandson that he is a little genius, I am hoping that he finished he's college, he's on his last year  in college,.☺️ / []
To create a religion you only need two things. 1) something of virtue or false virtue 2) someone to demonize.  Then knowing good and evil your eyes will be opened and you will be just like God. It’s the oldest lie in the book. Woke has become a false religion and leads many to the condemnation of self righteousness. / []
The left media is to blame for much of violence. / []
People that don't believe this have serious issues. / []
People better wake up, and pay attention.  How is this not believable? Just look at the way our government was running.  This is a meeting of great minds. Neglect it and pay dearly / []
Everyone had to know, if we kept going in the direction we were headed that this country would crash.  All this Elon uncovered,  open border.  There was no chance for us. I am 67. Never have I seen this country in this shape,  and such treasonous decisions.  Asking for trouble / []
Seize all of Stacey Abrams assets. Send hee to prison. / []
These judges are acting ideologically thus have given up their right to arbitrate law. There needs to be a way to stop these types of actions if they are not in line with the laws and are purely obstructive activism. It is just the usual leftistly insane lawfare. The justice system has been broken for a long time now. So much so that justice does not belong in the title anymore. / []
People have been lining their pockets. / []
To much undocumented money. / []
How could you not have confidence in a man like Elon that is so humble. What is unbelievable is that our government let all this happen. Why not cut their administration if they are not performing. Hire capable people. Period.  Wasting our money we worked our entire life for. / []
Couldn't or shouldn't these department heads, where the money is hemorrhaging, be charged with embellishing? / []
Why is Elon talking about saving a trillion or a trillion and one half trillion dollars here, and two weeks later, he leaves and the news is talking about one and one half billion dollars savings, and then the congress spends more than the savings ! / []
They have not saved us a dime. Just firing people and closing social programs. Plus fabulous cabinet? Really? At least we have measles. / []
We American TAX Payer Citizens want our money back from all the DEMOCRATS DEI CRAP!! IT IS AND WAS RACISM!! / []

We have millions of vacant  beautiful office buildings we don't use anymore for that purpose.  Due to computers.  And lazy workers. They would make beautiful clean Assembly  line factories. We dont even  have to build! Thanks lazy workers! Lol And Biden gave us millions of workers! Thanks Biden? I  think not!  We have to do this America! China's  crap they sell us is toxic!  So wht do we buy from them? / []

Great job Doge helping Trump to make American great again, you’re doing an amazing job giving Americans hope for a brighter future for their children. / []
LISTEN UP GENTLEMEN HISTORY WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR WORK FOR AMERICA 🇺🇸  PAY ZERO ATTENTION TO THE CLUELESS 🙈 DEMOCRAT CLOWNS. ITS OBVIOUS THEY HATE THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN WORSE THE AMERICAN TAX PAYERS. / []
They won’t put the truth out hunny on fake news outlets ,,,, here you will hear the full story and not a story like fake news spells out here you will hear the story not A story…. / []
Dems won't allow it to be shown so they can brain wash ALOT more people to go to events to picket nonsense it's all lies but the people are being paid well to go to these events , I COULD USE THE MONEY TO GO TO EVENTS . / []
Imagine if he had won in 2020 how much further along we would be! / []
I find that there are people out there so incredibly narrow-minded unable to  see what else is there besides  anything that is not “democratic party rules”.  They are children like people that need guidance to survive obviously ignorant and to lazy  to learn, stay unemployed and depend on the Government . It is easy for the democrats to keep them chained. / []
why no charges against anyone yet? .cause its a made up story.. / []
Who known wkat people belong to. / []
Regardless of what LYING DEMOCRATS say. A government AUDIT is OVERDUE! DEMOCRATS have been STEALING for decades!!! / []
I'm 100% with Elon Musk, for his devotion AND for his humanitarian perspective towards Ukraine-Russia war, and young people dying!! WE ARE AT THIS ERA WE Have to pray for Trump's team. Even with them, without God, Peace cannot be reached. 🙏✝️✌🏽 / []
You tube is not letting me click the like button.  After I posted this comment went back to post and like button updated itself to like! / []
I think the gov. Of new jersey should be taken into custody for interference with deportation laws , this is treason act on it towards anyone who is in government / []
False narratives about our President should be illegal. It's slander and it should not be allowed especially in the media. Just like once upon a time it was illegal to burn the flag and now it's legal. Some things just should be sacred and that's that specially when over 80 million people voted for him you see that stupid Black sheep always seems to stand out. Thank God like we saw in the election there's only about 20 or 25% that are evil in this country. / []
This is a perfect example of Good and evil. Elon musk, throughout history the good always prevails...! What are good human you are🎉❤ / []
There are democratic party members who saying the opposite of the truth, president trump has clearly said to carefully fix our country using a scalpel not an ax, Democrats are saying the opposite they are lying / []
800,000 for a survey it's an insider job. Especially that it cannot be substantiated.  The question is valid 'why are they doing it this , you don't have to". I just think they have the means God's bless them with lots of wealth, and now can get to give back big!!and also secure the future for their families and ours. what a commendable thing. I think all of these guys are sent from none other than God himself. And it's our luck and the whole United States and possibly the world because they could copy this. We're lucky that they recognized and they're good souls. We are very lucky❤ / []
GOD BLESS ALL YOU GUYS AND GIVE ‘EM HELL BOYS / []
When is DOGE going to get to the VA and revel the level of stupidity in that system ? / []
15 people over 100 people. Send something to this address to verify. That's a hard one to figure out. Ask for verification / []
I heard one Dem say Elon Musk and bunch of 18 years olds, meaning that he has young, inexperienced, wet behind the ears , know nothings manning the DOGE staff.  Do these people look like the description the Democrat gave of his staff  ??? / []
Amazing! / []
Why don't anyone who wants to find out about a program be given information on / []
I truly believe in second chances in life and in the power of God and my fellow man Dod Bless you all / []
These people are liars. They are doing this to make themselves richer. If they cared, they wouldn't want another tax cut. If they cared about social security, they would get rid of the cap on paying into social security. / []
They want to cut programs to give themselves a big tax cut. If they are being careful about cuts why did they have to rehire  nuclear and health officials? They cut IRS officials that investigate the rich not the ones that investigate the average person. Trump put us farther in the hole the last time with his tax cuts. Trump will put us farther in the hole with his new tax cuts. Wake up people. / []
Musk doesn't show evidence to his claims. Do you really think these rich men care about the average person? Musk is firing people who were investigating him for crimes. Musk is giving himself government contracts while he takes away programs that help people. Nothing but lies. Wake up, people, the rich don't care about you. / []
Why do all these tech guys still pay people with cheques and post? I am an Aussie 81 Y.O. Pensioner and have never seen one for 20 years. Everything is paid into my bank account, and all my monthly payments just happen with direct debit. My bank no longer has branches due to no one using them. I never carry cash, just a debit card. No one requires tips with useful wages. Did all these awful frauds only happen under Joe, Elon? / []
Elon's Behind the scenes giving to help WeThe People is a struggle to find the money to pay for a lift out of the deep hole we have fallen into... Are you ready?  Elon says after after telling you how much it will cost...and agin you hope for a better life than the one you lost but then he states how much to send him and asks agin "Are you ready"? But you recieve no gift because he says agin what amount to pay and shows pictures and once again asks "Are you ready?" Till finally you realize the scam and your hope is crushed when you get the next payment amount...😂  Jessa / []
The dumbest video watched and enjoyed by the poorly educated. / []
They need to recheck what the supreme Court said because the supreme Court did not say that Trump had to bring him home he just they just said that he had to allow him to come home if he can get here. / []

You termites really believe this 😂😂 not even 4 full months have passed and you all are mentally conditioned.

What a bunch of d*** suckas 😂😂😂 / ["You talk like you wouldn't have the Harris administration tickling your prostate right now if she won."]

I’m still upset that people like me  that applied for SSID in 2023, still can’t get an approved for a program I paid into, not only having no insurance and be eligible for programs while waiting for my conditions. Then last year in October, I lost my vision in my right eye, so I am blind, technically blind in one eye, and I still cannot get an approval for even a fraction of what I should be getting. Then see a different video showing that immigrants are getting SSI benefits and Medicaid Medicare and SNAP benefits. I’m so thoroughly disgusted and it makes me sick to know that this country has gotten so bad, who’s helping the little people? Who’s helping us get what we deserve even with getting denied since 2016, almost 10 years of struggling, and when is someone going to help me because of all this crap. / []
Thank you for all the work and sacrifices you gentlemen are doing. / []

Kudos for DOGE! / []
I wish Elon would do the same thing with Minnesota's inefficient government. There is huge waste in MN. Government should not be viewed as a growth industry. / []
YES!!  Thank you and your TEAM for  SAVING AMERICA.  GOD BLESS YOU ALL / []
The retirement process and the annuity process is painfully slow!!! My ex husband (a veteran and retired ICE officer) passed away in October and I am still waiting for them to get to my case.  It’s been so difficult to financially get by.  My ex husband committed suicide and I have tried to stay home as much as I can to ensure our son is safe and knows that he has support.  He left his annuity to me and I can’t get any funds.  It’s been a horrible experience! / []
MAGA DOGE / []
Thank you to everyone working at DOGE ! My heroes ! / []

Thank you everybody it's much appreciated! The American people always new we were being lied too by our government. Congress and the Senators have been selling us out to China for years.

The bank account isn't only my name I have an authorized delegated irrevocable permanent position I have my own monetary system / []

DON'T BLAME MUSK'S TEAM AT DOGE: If the Social Security Administration's web site crashed four times in one month, preventing retirees from accessing information concerning their Social Security accounts because these kind of computer server crashes at the Sociual Security Administration have been occurring for several years.  In fact, they have been happening long before Donald Trump ever became president and even longer before Elon Musk took charge of DOGE and getting rid of federal waste and recovering billions of dollars in American tax payer dollars.   I can tell you from experience as a Social Security recipient who, from time to time, was not able to access my Social Security account online because the web site  for Social Security was experiencing technical difficulties and many times they would state their web site was down for maintenance. / []
Those ignorant people protesting should study up on this topic versus thinking what they see on social media is the truth / []

One account I want to fix is the libraries.   We need to establish a federal library for digital media rights that the public system can use.

The VA's from state to state are not connected. While on the road, I lost my prescription. I still had refills on it and was do for a refill, anyway. The VA in the other state couldn't simply refill my prescription,  I had to be seen by a doctor. The doctor had no access to my records. All they had to go on was that I had a VA card and I had scars to show that I was injured. They had to call my state's VA to confirm that I was prescribed that drug. The doc gave me only 3 days worth of meds. / []

This is hideous, evil and so wrong! Obviously, the only thing that matters to the Democrats his power the power to do what? The Dems don't care about the United States of America or the people!

We support all of them for giving up so much for us. Thank you, Fox, for doing this interview.

Knowing that the system is still paper-based and is over 70 years old, it is clear that there is something very wrong that has been dragging on and needs technological updating, digitalization and automation.

Every American should have access to this interview. It provides the background of the DOGE team, their specific expertise, what they are finding and the solutions they offer. One can tell from the conversation they are astute and knowledgeable in their specialty areas and feel strongly about the importance of finishing their work so that the country does not fail. The government has obviously “operated” under absurd antiquated systems that don’t “communicate” with each other which set the stage for massive corruption whether intended or not. Frankly, I am amazed we have made it this long given the circumstances. Kudos to Elon for heading this up and for bringing these very talented team members to overhaul the financial systems of the federal government. The waste is so rampant, you wonder how anything has gotten done in decades. It is simply indescribable. Thank you to Fox for hosting this important group interview to enable Americans to understand the dire need for such a commission. And kudos to Elon who is personally invested in this project because he knows that America cannot continue down the path we have been on any longer. It was the most eye opening interview session I have ever witnessed. Sincere thanks to everyone working on this project. You are to be commended for your devotion and efforts to this massive project. THANK YOU!!! / []

I am too pessimistic to want to part with non-electronic records across the board.  Why don't archeologists know what assorted artifacts are for?

This is a very interesting interview.  The one thing I take issue with is Musk calling Senator Kelly a traitor for "putting the interest of another country (Ukraine) above America".  I agree; however, if that is the measure of traitor then he needs to look at how the U.S. is putting the interests of Israel above those of America. Where is his contempt for the killing of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian kids? / []

Here is the frightening thing. You can post this as much as you want but for some reason everyday Americans won’t truly tune in or understand how much good you are trying to do and your people will get get tired of trying to help and give up over time. Please understand that it’s not DOGE’s fault it’s the American people’s fault for not recognizing and realizing what this department is really trying to do. What I’m saying is this country is so dumb because they are used of everything being okay no matter what that they don’t realize what is really going on but I promise you by the time they wake up it will be too late. At that point all the DOGE workers will be long gone because they have wealth they didn’t need to help but they tried and the average ignorant American will suffer severely because they didn’t act or speak up when DOGE tried to inform them. / []

Governmental accounting is well designed to help governmental entities know exactly where they are and able to issue their version of  "Financial Statements". They have to follow the rules, and what is happening here is not that. Governmental Accounting is specialized like cost accounting or forensic accounting, etc. The framework is out there. President Trump and Elon Musk would absolutely be aware of all this. Again, the rules need to be followed and regularly audited to keep them on track. Granted, this stuff can get very complicated, but it is achievable with the right people and systems. Thank goodness we have the team we have. That will make a huge difference in our ability to get and remain solvent. It helps a lot if people are competent and care. / []

Musk hasn't slashed anything to do with his companies and nothing he has supposedly been substantiated. ITS BEEN SLASH AND BURN NOT MEASURE TWICE CUT ONCE.. Trump added 9 Trillion dollars to the national debt his last term so he's not exactly some savior of the United States.. Everything DOGE has found has either been debunked or lost two or three zeros behind it.. As for Trump’s genius cabinet.. Not one of them is actually qualified to do their jobs.. Musk just gave himself a government contract to build armored Teslas for Billions of dollars.  Considering over 40,000 of his Cybertrucks were just recalled I wouldn't trust him to build anything for the military. / []
Crazy question why are they doing this why are the billionaires doing this, oh well let's see if America fails their billions are worth nothing period question answered like OMG dude / []
Thank you, President Trump for appointing this great Patriot Mr. Elon Musk . Thank you DOGE team ! / ['Clown']
This is phenomenal information and destroys the Democrats misinformation, their dissembling, their propaganda and their corrupt ideologies and the only winners are the American taxpayers. Thank goodness for all these wonderful, Patriotic individuals who have put a temporary hold on their own businesses and families to revolutionise the Government Bureaucracy and empower Government employees. / []

Thank God for President Trump, thank God for Elon and the rest of DOGE, Steve Davis, Joe Gebbia, Aram  Moghaddassi, Brad Smith, Anthony Armstrong, Tom Crass and Tyler Hassen (and  their spousies too for their support)!  Its an honor to see these people at work in my lifetime. Thank you. / []

@e2U 26 minutes ago AOC is the Planed replacement for Peelooser, and if you look up Peelooser and JFK, you will see how that thing got into Government, and it wasn't for it's BRAINS:  NOTE, Our government is filled with PAID distractors, by design, to distract the people from the the ultimate Corruption, that do not go away, lead by the Gray Papal, self declared, PURE Bloodlines, as they hide in the shadows so no one knows who they are.

Why is everyone acting like this is being hidden from the American people?  What you mean is, why is no one else letting these people make a bunch of unsubstantiated claims without any pushback for validation. I just watched a 40 minute DOGE commercial.  No challenge as to why so many people got fired and had to be rehired because, oops, they are working to prevent the spread of if Ebola, or, oops, they run the nuclear weapons program.  Elon's excuse is that no one bats a thousand. These aren't simple mistakes. They're f'ups that happen when you indescrimately slash a bunch of departments without doing any analysis first.  Why have so many veterans lost their jobs?  And this claim about transparency is a joke. I've looked at the website.  Here's every event that is posted:  we just cut $125 million from the Depatment of (fill in the blank), including $300,000 in toilet paper.  What about the other $124,700,000??????  You call that transparency?  It's amazing what people dont question.  Critical thinking is a lost art in this country, if it ever was one.  If you live in a bubble, then if course you believe that no one is  talking about this. / []
These are true patriots , true public servants / []
Here are some inaccuracies or misleading statements related to DOGE and Elon Musk: 1.National Park Survey Claim: Musk claimed that the National Park Service spent nearly a billion dollars on a survey, which was found to be unsubstantiated by investigations (Ferguson, 2025; CBS News, as cited in Ferguson, 2025). 2.Misrepresentation of Federal Expenditures: DOGE’s accounting practices have been criticized for inaccuracies, including counting contracts multiple times and using outdated information (The New York Times, 2025). 3.DOGE’s Savings Claims: DOGE asserts it has saved billions, but these figures are often unreliable and unverifiable (Kraemer, as cited in Fortune, 2025; The New York Times, 2025). / []
I’m interested in the salaries and Vacation Days the employees responsible for the “paper management and processes”… / []
why didnt  the DOGE team invite Catherine Austin Fitts and a proffessor Skidmore onto the team?    Fitts is a former asst Secretary of HUD and a brilliant macroeconomic expert who slong with prof Skidmore have spent years studying and reporting on missing TRILLIONS in the federal govt.  Sound familiar?  Ive heard her many times use the term unaccountable transactions and what does the DOGE team reveal?  The same kind of unaccountable transactions all over the place comprising giant corrupt slush funds. / []
I really don’t think that the democRATS  are capable of comprehending what DOGE is doing and how they’re doing it and that is part of the reason they spew frightening lies that they do. / []

Maybe DOGE should get rid of Trump! / ['Look, if your gonna pull out this point, who took a larger percentage of their time as president off? Biden took 39% of his days off during his term and trump only took 26%. Now if you want to look at a REAL hardworker whether you like im or not is Obama, he only took 6.3% of his time off (All these are comparing first terms only). For perspective the average full time work averages 10-13% of their time off. So Biden is 3x, Trump is 2x and Obama is 0.5x', 'Such a stupid and ignorant comment. Itemize the expenses, if you can.

So far I'm impressed with what they've done.  However, I am a little concerned about the talk of digitizing documents from Iron Mountain discussed starting at the 6:08 mark.

Great interview, Bret Baier and DOGE team!  Can Elon elaborate on what he means by people will get more, not less, social security?  His answer was a bit vague.  Sounds like there are a lot of rice bowls in HHS.  What about the rumors of people being let go for being "unfit for government service"?  This sounds like it would set former employees up for a struggle to find a new job.  Now IS a good time to cut problem people, and it's very important that good people aren't getting untrue labels.  You especially want to set good people up to be able to easily move into other employment - it's the least any boss owes good employees. / []

If you dig deeper into what’s being said, there’s deception. Slight of hand. Quietly, while you look this way, Musk is following the plan to get rid of our entire banking system to benefit himself. Communications to benefit himself.  Computer and transportation to benefit himself.  We are selling our soul and the way they do it is by moving quickly on several fronts so that you can’t see what’s happening until it’s too late. Slight of hand. / []

I have read about for the last 5 minutes some comments. I love Elon Musk, i really think he's one of rhe next steps in evolution! I also watched the whole Trump vs Kamala elections, not the news, but almost all the public speeches.  I am happy for rhe USA, but i live in the UE, so I'm feeling sorrow.... And the last part of this interview make me feel more worry then ever...to simplify: I am fluent in 3 languages,now i am learning another one, the 4th. I would like to not be obligated to learn the 5th: Russian / []

15:11 hours.. I get that Jerry is the only problem with the cowboys! But to say that Jerry is disrespectful for wanting to negotiate with the man he's paying rather than an agent is disrespectful itself. I'm sorry but when I got interviewed for my job which has been my career for 15 years now,I didn't send my dad or mom or buddy into the office to make my case for me. And sorry but Micah parsons is worth more to the cowboys leaving the team then he is staying with the cowboys. He's not the best defensive player in the league he's top 5 at best. He sucks against the run. He's an animal no doubt about it but as a cowboy hell never reach his ceiling because he's breaking the bank just like dak just like ceedee and just like trevon! All of them fold like a paper football when it matters most! Jerry is the reason for the problem. Sad thing is, when his time comes to the end, his kids are no better at understanding football. As a cowboy fan thru hell and high water I understand that it's gonna be a hard rest of my life watching my team get it wrong year after year until I die because they already proved me right! But I dont waiver, jump ship or divert from my team! I was authentic at 1-15 and I'll remain authentic as the dumpster fire of the league! 🫣😒 / []

I’d like to see a spreadsheet summary of the agency, the spent money, savings, and a short comment of the purpose on the spending. Perhaps in a cvs or xls format. / []
Yes, DOGE... You are doing what Democrats and Republicans should've done many years ago. Everyone gets blame but it's funny that one of the many waste full spending was for government funding to Elon Musk in the past. Also all these guys have received some money from tax payers and it was ok then. I'm ok with DOGE and if it destroys everything then so be it but remember if you are not a person who lives on less then you will not make it. / []
Elon is great.  Keep it up man! / []

How dare you dems! That IS NOT what President Trump is doing. Can't you hear? Why do you have to lie lie lie? Does your lying mouth ever bleed 🩸 / []
No every thing is going to be one big mess / []
The second most important question is, are you going to follow the money and properly punish the people who did these things? If not it will just happen again. I would guess a lot of it benefited powerful people. / []

We can't reason with these demonic sprits 😮.  Talking to our demonic opponents gets us nowhere, sad to say . I believe in these times more than ever we will win, but it will come from believers coming together in church revivals  praying and worshiping to God, Jesus and the Holy Sprit for ending this crisis. Clearly, we can't fight these demonic spirits, but God will demolish them . Stop thinking we can make a difference at this time in our lives . Give it over to God Almighty in Prayer! / []

These men are so right and trying to fix our country. / []
Should i take my parents deth certs down to Social Security. / []
They find fraudsters calling people at a rate of 40%, and their solution is to fire employees. That's stupid. That does nothing to stop the fraudsters' from calling. In fact, I believe it makes it easier for the fraudsters to get away with their crime because there are fewer people on staff to handle the cases. DOGE/Musk is full of sh**! / []

So if people would listen what he's saying is that he's weeding out the bad ones that take care of the money that gets sent out to the people 🤷🏻‍♂️ but Dems are stuck on who's doing it and it's getting annoying / []

Very important that ,ive gone with this account to F.B.I. headquaters of elpaso ,texas and ask to speak to a representative notifying front  gaurd more than 5 times about my account being hack,and still they do t let me speak with one ,guard give me a nu.ber which i call all the times they provide number and some f  fake agent answers that eventu as lly habgs up in the middle of conversation other times they dont even a mnswer phone leaving me waiting with wierd music  for 15 to 30 min. Waiting .i certainly dont know how to hack. But the person who left it in my house cause he needed his wife to come home begg me of i could loan him money for a bus ticket and said he we ould come back and pay me ,never came back for the device but how wierd and coencidently knows my girl  before i met her abd more limely t as lk to each other till this day. He was working with the girl that owns that tablet. He just never came back. All of a udden i notice phone tracking to me and the tarot people which i was looking for this people attacking me and my family from tarot  speaking to me .this very same people that know my girl and are related to her. ..the person who gave it to me because he needed his wife back home was supposebly with this girl that were working at the time together where working in the same c ompany. Later went to another r friend told my friend he got stranded broke into my friends house and attemted to steal some coin collection and a rifle after that friend had all day attemting to get him out stranded in dessert with the company truck he work with at the time.some confusing story that i couldnt figure out but i have no intentions of messing with  device .for all i know it certainly looks like another of my girls set up to put me in jail with lies. Something ive had suspicious since years but couldnt blame her cause mother said she has childish behaviors and is a habd full. I open .my door cause this same individual  had drop her off in the apartment ,she didnt have a place to stay. / []

Making America Great Again for America First Proponents: A Revolutionary Proposal for Comprehensive AI Government  To truly make America great again, we must go beyond empty rhetoric and take decisive action. This proposal outlines a revolutionary approach to governance—a comprehensive AI-driven government system that eradicates entrenched corruption, kleptocracy, money laundering, and kickbacks. The current system, plagued by foreign aid to Israel and campaign contributions from AIPAC, has perpetuated a cycle of corruption that we can no longer tolerate.  AIPAC as a Ransomware Virus AIPAC can be likened to a ransomware virus that has infiltrated and compromised the American political system. Just as ransomware takes control of a computer, demanding payment to unlock critical files, AIPAC has ensnared our government, manipulating policy decisions and holding our democracy hostage. The influence of AIPAC ensures that the flow of American tax dollars to Israel continues unabated, with the same money returning to influence our lawmakers, perpetuating a scam that has paralyzed true democratic governance.  The Need for a Complete Overhaul Like a computer infected with ransomware, our government system requires a complete overhaul—a reboot with a clean, uninfected program that is resistant to outside influence. This is where a comprehensive AI-driven government system comes in. By eliminating the virus-like influence of AIPAC and similar special interest groups, we can restore the integrity of our democracy.  Implementing a Comprehensive AI Government  Establish Direct Democracy: Replace traditional representatives in both houses with a system that allows citizens to participate directly in governance. This AI-driven government will operate transparently and in real-time, empowering citizens to engage in decision-making from the comfort of their homes.  Cut Ties with Special Interests: The AI system will be free from the influence of special interest groups, political parties, and foreign lobbies like AIPAC. Decisions will be made solely in the public’s interest, ending the manipulation of our government by outside forces.  End the Cycle of Corruption: By drastically reducing military spending and foreign aid, particularly to Israel, we will stop the flow of American tax dollars being used to buy influence in our government. This will eliminate the kickbacks and money laundering disguised as campaign contributions, ensuring that every decision is made for the benefit of the American people.  Benefits of the Comprehensive AI Government  Empowered Citizenry: The power is returned to the people, with direct democracy ensuring that governance decisions truly reflect the will of the public.  Enhanced Transparency and Accountability: The AI system’s actions are transparent and accountable, with all decisions accessible for public review, ensuring that the government remains in check.  Optimized Resource Allocation: AI-driven analysis will optimize resource allocation and policy decisions, improving public services, reducing waste, and directing resources to where they are needed most—improving infrastructure, education, healthcare, and more.  Improved Public Services and Infrastructure: By eliminating unnecessary military expenditures and focusing on domestic prosperity, the AI government will significantly enhance the quality of life for American citizens.  Checks and Balances: Built-in redundancies and independent oversight will ensure the AI system adheres to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, preventing corruption from taking root at its source. This will restore trust in the system, as every decision can be audited and verified for its adherence to American values and laws.  Conclusion This comprehensive AI government proposal offers the only viable path to making America truly great again. It empowers citizens, eliminates corruption, and refocuses our resources on what truly matters—improving the lives of the American people. By replacing traditional representatives with a transparent, accountable AI system, we can restore the true meaning of democracy and cleanse our government of the virus-like influence of special interest groups like AIPAC. The time for a complete overhaul is now, and with the right system in place, we can reboot America and restore it to its rightful greatness. / []

Those of us who love our country are behind you 100%, and will continue to pray for your protection. / ["An interview on Fox is all you need? I'd like to see a concrete report with auditors and testimony in front of Congress so Elon can answer questions."]
Why isnt telsa factory in communist China shut down? Why does he prioritize hiring foreign nationals over US citizens in his own companies? total BS / []
That was intense / []
China has been charging USA 60% for years while Usa charged them only 3%…. All thru out years of Democrat presidents who always highlighted that same Fact.  But no president have had the courage, the resolve, the skills to lift a finger to do it.  Trump is BRAVE!  This is a very exciting time to be alive.  It’s an honor to not only watch but also to experience the first sets of Counter Revolutionary measures launched by Trump to pull America back from letting allies & unfriendliness taking advantage of USA’s past generosity.  Trump has been criticizing the unfair tariffs since in his 20’s.  Excellent to see he’s got the chance in this presidency to show us how he’s playing his cards. / []
These guys are ALL HEROS! And I hope & PRAY that they will ALL be remembered in time for their heroism because they DESERVE every BIT of it . . . .   Susan Burns / []

I'm not sure they fully understand Iron Mountain. I don't know how the government uses it, but my company stored original paper documents for disaster recovery purposes. If the online copies were lost or compromised we would pull the box and make a new copy from the original. It's a very well-known service in the financial industry. When we pulled boxes from Iron Mountain it only took a day or two  to get them. The government may have a different crappy system from what for-profit financial industry companies have in the same Iron Mountain. / []
Uhh billionaires talking about helping the country cause it's going bankrupt but their companies don't pay a dime of tax since they're registered in tax haven countries...how ironic. Don't buy into to this bs they're hiding something. / []

Brett I think you could have said I appreciate your efforts.  You as an American should be undone by  DOGE findings. / []

Wow. How enlightening. Thanks a lot to the whole team and families. Are some of you going to write novels with these incredible and absurd situations. Thank God for all are doing not only to save us but the world. God bless you all. What is so sad when I hear these crazy and liers in the media are so grossly ignorant to label Mr. Trump an Mr. Musk team. I would never act that stupid. Let’s just ignore them. Blessings to you all. / []
Don’t I remember all the crazy communist Democrats screaming and laughing about how doge was just a bunch of Young smelly computer nerds who lived in their mom‘s basement you know really ridiculous things like that?  Well, it looks like that they’re more a bunch of successful businessman all over the age of 30 at least who, instead of ripping our government to get wealthy through corruption insider trading things like that they built up companies that succeeded and I’d suggest it’s their success and therefore growing bank accounts the leftist hate the most.. besides the fact that they’re possibly gonna catch up to they gonna get found out my fingers are crossed. / []

No! It's not like a person tells you to sell or buy a certain stock that the person knows will do well or poorly. When you act on what you are told, in this case, you are not doing wrong yourself. The guy firebombing a Tesla Dealership is wrong for HIS OWN actions. And like the person in my analogy, the person/s giving that man false information IS also wrong. / []
We need to hold the fraudsters and criminals accountable otherwise it's going to culminate into a civil matter and that's what evil wants 💩🙉 / []
So a bunch of billionaires are running free in the government what could go wrong? / ["But they aren't. \nFrom the beginning. Hear me:\nTHEY HAVE AN ADVISORY ROLE ONLY.\nNo changes have been implemented without agency heads and even congressional oversight. Those items of contention have been, and are still going, to the Supreme Court.", 'What an ignorant comment. Every one of these billionaires accomplished more in an hour than you do all year. Go outside and play.']
I think the president needs to report to the people of this Country what has been found, how it's being corrected, and to stop beleaving everything you hear. The Fox News special report going on right now references the DOGE finding should be on prime time TV. / []
Where are the receipts? Where's the evidence? Taxpayers are seeing news reports from multiple independent sources that Elon Musk has no evidence whatsoever. Even staff members from DOGE are resigning because they refuse to lie for Elon! / []

What no-one understands and realises is this: Money comes from nowhere. It does not matter if the government owes one dollar or a hundred trillion dollars. How has the debt affected the people of America? How has it affected an individual? Has anyone asked them to pay off the debt?  No. The debt is just a book-entry. Six months ago everyone was existing perfectly happy with the debt.  The debt does not affect anyone. It does not matter if the debt increases. No-one is affected now and no-one will be affected if it increases or decreases. The whole concept of taxes is a scam. The rich pay almost nothing towards the debt but they buy houses for tenants and buy companies and factories for the workers. Musk cannot use or eat his money. Even if he loses 99.9% he will still have millions. You have go to “think outside the box” and realise the only thing that matters is HARMONY. The most evil part of Trump and Musk is DISHARMONY. DISCORD and DISRUPTION. They have disrupted millions of lives with this evil concept that an imaginary debt has to be paid for  “in blood” by people that have never created it. Not only have they not created it, but they cannot reduce it, because it does not exist. / []
The level of lying and gaslighting in this interview is stunning. / ['How?

The economy, our people, and our country have never been in more danger than it is now under this new administration.  We have never had more un qualified people in leadership positions. We have never lost so much respect in the world as a country. / []

Each American can be given $1,000,000 million.  😊 Please PASS THE MESSAGE TO karoline to forward to PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVE $$$ TO AMERICANS FIRST.   Why would Trump give Ukraine $billions when 🤔  there's only 334 million Americans?  It will ONLY costs $334,000,000.00 million dollars 💵 if he gave each person -  to make every American citizen life better.   PRESIDENT TRUMP &  family will be presidents forever.  VANCE could be next president, then Donald Jr. Ivanka, Eric, Barron.  They donate millions to charities all the time. And give to foreign countries. GIVE TO AMERICANS FIRST. Trump policy can be forever. / []
Disgraceful spending / []
This is laughable, I guess AI wrote these positive comments 😅!!! / []
this a rare occurrence of glitch in Elon''s context switching algo, so he says "nominal deficit" on fox news even though no one has a clue what that means. It will likely be fixed with next release. / []
Elon is correct.  The biggest mistake is doing nothing. / []
It sure sounds great to the people when someone says "We will stop the government wasting all your hard earned tax money and make America great again"  The people at the bottom have been angry for centuries that the richer people are richer and that uncle sam is keeping them poor.  But as great as it sounds there will be some trade offs here, and I'm not convinced that the American worker will be better off under the trump/musk system. / []
Dont you just love this common sense! What a dream team.....🎉 / []
I believe the next thing we need to review is school taxes and the elderly. It’s killing them and everything they worked for, they should not be responsible for school age children especially in their golden years. / ["I've been paying for a school for 20 years, not elderly, and no children."]
Thank goodness you’re doing this! America needs you I need you  don’t give up your absolutely making America great again ❤ / []
Elon should take some time off for himself. This is just round 3.  First round was X,  Second round was helping getting Trump in so we'd end the madness and corruption that is WOKE/DEI/ESG and running a pscyho op on us civilians like p-ing on our backs and telling us its a much needed sunshine shower.  Corrupt. mindless. and now dying.  But they still have pinchers. Beware they are angry like walking dead. :) / []
Elon you and your team are amazing!  We appreciate you so much.  This needs to be broadcasted all over so maybe everyone will get how important this mission is! You are heroes to most of us. You are literally saving our country. Please stay safe!❤ / []
This distinction is important because the result of DOGE, to the extent there is any, will be to privatize government functions for the benefit of oligarchs and Wall Street. For instance, … / []
Thank you Bret for bringing this to peoples eyes and ears. / []
God bless the DOGE team!! ❤ / []
The Left is loathing in hate over what these men are attempting to rectify for the American people! All these men and women are in danger because from President trump on down they are destroying the lefts ability to steel our tax dollars right under our noses! & have been doing for decades!

DOGE: "Why would it take so long to retire?"  US Government: "Well, because of the mine, of course."  DOGE: "Mine...?"   That training class for federal retirement is a episode of Monty Python 🤣🇺🇸. / []
I agree most wars the people die for nothing. Just for some special interest people that benefit from it in a place where they never see the suffering of the war. Its evil. / []
I want my money back. The federal government has, for decades wasted our hard earned tax dollars that they’ve forced upon us and they can’t even prove where it’s gone. Give me my money back. GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK! We can’t continue letting them take and take and take. / []

Do you trust the guy with a chainsaw who gleefully fired hardworking Americans yelling "chainsaw"? You trust these billionaires? Best of luck! / []
Its good to have a diary at hand. The system can be hacked. / []
How did you calculate those fake tariffs we are being charged, Mr. President?? Your super smartass team took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's export to us!!!

Elon, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your work.  Know that you have true American's support. / []

34:25 I don’t blame them for protesting what they are protesting and fearing what they fear. With the point of view they are being forced into and information they are being told, I’m glad so many people are attempting to act against it. But most of what they fear is propaganda designed to do exactly that.   It’s impossible to track it all, and that’s why the people on the side of the road with signs who flip off me because the car I drive. I don’t jump to conclusions about why they are standing there. Because for all I know they could legitimately be standing for a cause that DOGE may have legitimately impacted. / []
Simple math,not common core. / []
Very good work,thank you.🎉 / []
I think theyre building a social credit system and everything they do that makes people mad and that sounds racist is all to gather data on everyone to determine where in the ranking of society you will be when everything goes fully autonomous online... / []

So wild!!!! Paperwork housed in a mine. Ancient! I’m glad they are upgrading the digital systems. / []

kinda feel like everyone I surround myself with is making very specific line item critiques, ad nauseam, to the extent that the public has access to such information.  we can't critique the line items which DOGE is has backdoor access to which is supposed to be internal information.  thats called a straw-man argument.  if you want to be transparent and foster "intelligent" critique, then don't push spin and logical fallacies in defending yourself.  and the numbers say that an average of 4,500 people have been fired from their government jobs EVERY DAY.  I have a small business and nearly 20% of my clients have lost their jobs.    these are all great words, and you may be right about most of what you are saying.  i've interned in the California assembly and I can attest that the technology systems are a nightmare and desperately need updated.  excepting that very critical statements and statistics in your argument are NOT true.  and key members of DOGE have radical ideologies with agendas to use this update to target and eliminate US citizens who are doing nothing but trying to just live their lives. / []

No one voted for Musk and the reality is possible that Russia honed its election interference program and T did not win the election.

It is going to be very easy for the Lord  to separate the wheat from the tares upon His return.   All he has to do is look for those who are full of🎉 hate and rage in their souls.  They are so  full of it that there no room for love and fairness.  It is OK to labor and become  comfortably rich.  Unions, in my understanding, are supposed to see after the health, safety, and fair treatment of the laborers,  not to selfishly run the company, displaying greedy attitudes.  Companies that make great efforts to suppress competition are also showing greedy attitudes.  That is a lose-lose situation, and greed and hatered abound. The devil is winning. He lives.👹He has a historical lifetime of experience. We  each need to reflect upon our attitudes, settle down, be patient,  and calmly communicate fairly. / []

its easy finding waste in government, but no one ever does it anywhere close to this degree, because it always comes with political consequences, because the purist politician wants to please everyone.

By the way, the Dems and leftists angry without a specific  reason?  This is obvious, there still angry they lost the election,    Doge and their work is for us to see online, everything they do, instead of bitching, go look up doge access to data, now that we’ve resolved that little issue, to those higher ups , your scaring ppl for what? Seriously ,we asked you , what specificity are you concerned about?   They had no specific reasons,     So having said this and shown you all the way, let’s get down to Maura Healey for one, why would she lie about all of this?,    what is this woman afraid we will find?    Not just Maura Healey please ask the higher ups why would they panic?    even when given the website,    now if we can see this work online?     What are we going to find out on them?  Maura Healey is screaming complaining, I think she counts on us not to look it up.     If we just believe without looking it up, she then finds a way to continue her own agenda. Let’s not look ignorant. Look it up, it’s not about hate or votes , it’s about what is ours in retirement.  True right? Don’t we want the ppl still stealing our tax moneys? No more hate, we have real answers now. / []

I feel bad for everyone, but has anyone seen Brett’s mouth movements, seems like he may be on something? I’m genuinely curious if anyone has noticed it? / []

I'm an American who serves as a professor in South Korea. Here, researchers get to use 90% of grant funds and the universities just get 10%. I'm glad to see that the division of funds in the US is moving to 85/15 from 60/40. Research funds should go to research, not university administration. I understand why universities should get some of the funding (they are providing administrative and physical resources that make research possible) but no more than necessary. / []

I wonder if the DOGE team will cancel any wasteful contracts with SpaceX. I'm kinda guessing they won't. Elon Musk has a huge conflict of interest here.

For Elon Musk, who I am appreciating, the hard sacrifices he has made. But I differ greatly about Ukraine. What is being tragically missed is that Ukrainians are willing to die to be free. Just like our nations founding and belief of "Living Free or die." We are so removed from what so many in this world have experienced, living in subjection and without freedom.  We need to be on the moral high ground, defending the Ukrainians who are giving their last full measure of devotion to be free. Standing up to a bully and invador and murderer. Putin must be stopped.🇺🇲🇺🇦 / []

Although this was a valuable piece and well worth watching, the real shame is they weren't asked challenging questions by someone really on top of the brief.

The 'wall of receipts' on their website is full of mistakes and just doesn't cut it. Finallly, Elon does himself no favours with stupid acts like his chainsaw stunt and X posts on feeding USAID into the woodchipper.

You say you are doing this but we have yet to see the proof. / []
This is sad. Amerika is downhill. No question. This is like last survival moments / []
When you're done Elon, would you help sort out NZ.  We spent 1 million dollars playing whale songs to trees. / []
IT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ME THAT THE LEFT/DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES THAT WANT THIS STOPPED, THEY SEEM CULPABLE AND GUILTY OF SOME SHENANIGANS OF STEALING THIS MONEY!  MUSK CERTAINLY DOESNT NEED THE MONEY NEITHER CORD TRUMP. TRUMP HAD GIVEN HIS SALARY FROM THE BEGINNING TO CHARITY, A FACT THE MEDIA WOULD NEVER MENTION! / []
SHARE!! Absolutely love this!! I so understand what they are doing so much better. SHARE SHARE / []
People including my family dont believe any of their findings / []
The most intelligent minds in the country should be encouraged to join doge to have the government run efficiently (after they’ve built their own empires of course) / []
I love this more each time I watch it / []
Is there a completely secure system to protect all of the same and connected systems? / []
i got all my s s i d money a few day be for it was due  same as every month  i just start checking my bank account  around the 28  each month and see the money due on the first is there / []
I love it who is not in favor of these guys helping us thats because they are in corruption / []
South African crybaby dope fiend!! / []
WE KNOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE THIEVES!!!   IT’S SO OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WITH BRAINS AND WHO HAS FOLLOWED THE MONEY TRAIL! / []
God bless these men!!!! Very grateful for them all. / []
There’s no left no right   As my Dad used to say to me there’s only two type of people in the world. There’s people and then there’s true people. Instead of asking the democrats to change just ask them to ether be a people or a true person. / []
RESIST MUSK / []
The 4894 people that thumbs down this video are so closed minded and completely lost.   Calling Elon is Yazzie is disgusting. / []
I'm so excited that Elon and his group are cutting waste down with a goal of 15%. / []
My husband (age 78) and I (soon 74) have always lived sparingly, carefully, borrowing from "Perter to pay Paul" sometimes. I drive our 1999 Ford Explorer with over 350 000 miles. The Lord has been gracious to us, and to our adult sons and their families. But now for us, as seniors on a fixed income, it is harder. We tried opening a small Airbnb to supplement our income. But those expenses allow us to break even. What will DOGE do to help seniors now? Medicare expenses makes medicines impossible with co-pays, deductibles, and corporate pharm cost. It is $ 600 month for one heart medication. Medicare helps with hospitalizations, but then we have big balances. If it weren't for my husband, who is legally blind with some peripheral vision, being under terrific VA care, we'd both have to do without medications and doctors visit.  Thank you for your efforts. But it seems to be too late for us. DotGE should become a permanent cabinet position. / []
I totally agree that there is that one person who pays these people and funds them. It only makes sense that there is a financier with all these things. As Political Science students, we understand rallies are mostly possible when funded. It's not only logic but common sense. / []
Keep going Elon. I'm sorry that you are being attacked. I support you 💯. Helping America move forward with nothing but a thank you is the most unselfish thing to do. I applaud you and your Teams. / []
Wish we had them in the UK 😢 / []
Trump's and Elon is Excellent jobs / []
Cant wait for congress to be audited / []
Is this an snl skit / []
That's all they know lies. Lies their father is the king of lies Satan Satan Lucifer. They have nothing else but lies. They don't know anything else / []
Yes they have the old playbook  "rules for radicals"Sal alinsky. It's their playbook. Line by line all you have to do is get it and read it / []
I’m so proud of these guys!!! / []
If people are losing their jobs due to DOGE’s actions it’s like, yeah I’m sorry that you worked for a fraudulent company. / []
Praise the Lord God already / []
True Elon Musk doesn’t have to do this and he doesn’t need this( like the great president Donald Trump said). He doesn’t need to take all absurd abuse.   True hero he is.  The whole nation needs to know  his heroism / []
Holy people. Those who hate them ... must be pretty guilty. / []
Great Job DOGE / []
This is soo impressive. 👏 / []
😮😮😮😮😮 / []
What in the world was that whimpering noise at the 37:35 ish mark? 😳🤔 / ['Little X', '@ oh ok. That makes sense. Because I was like what’s wrong with the film crew? 😳. 👍']
The media has done a number on the lefties. They all believe the lies spewed on tv. / []
Mission is to distract and/or project guilt . / []
The government system is a dinosaur for sure anyone in the military knows this / []
lol you can hear little X on the background / []
Abrams needs to be in jail! She committed a crime! IF IT WAS ANYONE ELSE THEY WOULD BE UNDER THE JAIL!!! THIS IS A UNJUST SYSTEM, WHERE THE ELITE CAN DO ANYTHING AN GO FREE!!!!!!!!! / []
Outstanding! This woman is dynamic! / []
Elon musk and the whole team is awesome. Thank y'all, / []
this is amazing / []
Elon Musk is truly shocked and in disbelief, having a hard time trying to come up with words after being exposed to the realities of media and government.  You can hear it in his voice and see it in his face.  It's not fake. / []
This was the biggest lie...ever...why not show ketamine king holding his chainsaw/bouncing around like a mental patient... / []
Thank you DOGE! / []
Elon Musk we're so PROUD of YOU and the DOGE TEAM GO PRESIDENT TRUMP !!❤ / []
27 CIOs that are non technical? That explains a lot. / []
The fact that United States did not have a verification process is crazy and plain wrong! / []
How about a cabinet position of "Auditor General?' Auditing should be a regular part of an efficient and honest effort. What if a lower bidder gets the job knowing about likely cost over-runs but perhaps is in fact "favored" for their political support, later? I propose that if proven, such must be prosecuted, perhaps? / []
😂😂 they are destroying redstates mostly / []
Just print some money / []
LEGENDARY 🔥 / []
These men are doing God’s work ❤🙏 / []
I wonder what Musk and friends think of the "Obamacare" web site launch. I think that they might have some interesting commentary about such things. / []
This video having more views than Snow White lol / []
Finally we needed this explanation. Good interview I feel / []
Every day I respect Mr. Musk more and more . He doesn't need this crap. He's doing this for nothing because he wants to save this country from collapsing. / []
Thank You President Trump, Elon Musk and Doge. / []
Congress likes their Status Quo system. It might be called "The Gravy Train" I prefer Cat Stevens'' song, "The Peace Train" or Arlo Guthrie's  "The City of New Orleans" I wonder what songs will be sung about a Martian colony or city, some day. / []
not true. Point me to the evidence of the $830 million contract for the survey. / []
Superb interview by Mr Brett Baier.  The entire DOGE team deserves the thanks of every American - and the American Medal of Freedom. / []
keep it up Elon / []
Liberals you're free ride is over / []
Some people complained that the Apollo project to the Moon cost $11 billion.  (Chicken feed by today's standards,?) Then Congress did their own cutbacks on NASA and efficiency in Congress gave us "someday, we will..." plans that always got cutback or abandoned. The "efficiency" of government is held down by bureaucratic weight, IMO. / []
❤ / []
This interview reminds me of the actor Fred Willard, but Fred was a lot more funny / []
A man who runs a multibillion dollar corporation is hugely qualified as an expert on "efficiency," IMO. I have never believed that governments are financially efficient, having witnessed boondoggle after boondoggle for decades, I think. If Musk had been of like attitude, the two stranded astronauts might still be aboard the Space station -- or worse??? / []
Thankyou Elon, and all the DOGE team.  finally!  Gov may need to fix their house and not mine! / []
They haven’t shared this on other networks because it’s all horseshit meant to be exclusively consumed by the dumbest people on planet earth - Trump supporters / []
Go DOGE ! Keep on truckin! / []
That is the worst description of the Ukraine war and what is happening that I have ever heard, the lack of empathy, and hell knowledge that this "supposed" genius is missing is really quite scary, especially since he is running so much of our "new world order..." ooops I mean "new government".... / []
No wonder the Democrats tried to assassinate Trump twice to keep all this corruption hidden. Well done Elon and all the other gentlemen on the Doge team. / []
Go DOGE. keep on going!!!! / []
1400 IT personal !!!! / []
27 CIO's !!!! / []
Over 15M individual over 120 years old… isn’t there a verification process once you reach a certain age hmmm / []
The truth will set you free!!! Thank you Elon. I’m so sorry people are being hateful to you. You deserve better / []
Well done!  You're doing it right! Don't stop, come overseas also! 👍👍💯 / []
This was a great watch! ❤ / []
Getting behind or bribing? / []
Fox's own special in- house concoction of bs,that's why this isn't nat'l news.duuuuh! / []
sir you are full of it  We are a constitutional republic. you sound life a communist / []
Yep , they aren't joking. I had an ex call social security and get my social security card , as well as having my mother get scammed by someone calling and ordering a new social security payment card sent to their address and stole her debit card. Just by calling and changing the address. It's deplorable and has been for quite some time. / []
liberalism is a mental illness / []
Same ole pitiful bs day in day out.What a real shythole this place has become in extremely recent months. / []
Both our villains, ignorant villains are still villains, but yes, the worst villains are the ones creating the environment for the ignorant people to become violent. For example, my uncle is complete bonkers like I think he’s literally going insane. He believes everything he’s told but I don’t think he’s innocent. I think he’s guilty for allowing himself to get that crazy and hateful. / []
80% of red states are on welfare. / []
For the NAYSAYERS making dumb comments here.   These people are all accomplished professionals at the top of their games. They all have reputations they want to protect and careers that will go on long after their time limited with DOGE.   It's inconceivable that these successful people would risk their futures for a lie, or to run some twisted scam on the American people. THAT MAKES NO SENSE.   Instead, simple logic tells me that these are sincere professionals actually trying to fix a big broken system while helping their fellow citizens. THAT MAKES SENSE. / []
I hate how all these other news stations. Let people say they’re cutting Social Security and don’t specify how. Doge is gonna stop paying dead Americans Social Security that are 130 years old. How was that? Not a good thing??? / []
We need you in Canada 😢❤ / []
The dog was crying...he knows you're right❤🎉 / []
Nobody believes the department of gross exaggerations. And he ruined a government that didn’t belong to him. / ["Only the people without a brain don't believe in Ditch Obviously Gross Excessive spending"]

Applaud 👏 / []
Why don't you actually try telling you the truth quit being Trump butt kisser / []
[laugh] / []
DOES ELON MUSK APPROVE OF THE KILLING OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN? DOES HE HAVE CONTEMPT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT THE VIOLENCE IN GAZA TO ON INDEFINITELY? / []
They are finding more than waste, they are finding criminal activity and theft of the people by politicians, judges and insider Democrat public sector thieves. / []
THE *FAR LEFT* IS NOT *GOING AFTER* ELECTRIC VEHICLES–– THEY ARE TARGETING TESLA.

They can’t comment because then they would be admitting to their participation. SMH. Go Doge! The little guys are rooting for you! / []
SO LET ME UNDERSTAND THIS:  DO WE AGREE THAT AGENCIES CAN BE CORRUPTED BY CORPORATIONS?  IF SO––– THE SOLUTION––TO *SHRINK GOVERNMENT* IS IDIOTIC. THE BIGGEST BILLIONAIRES IN THE WORLD WANT TO SHRINK GOVERNMENT, TO PRIVATIZE THEIR FUNCTIONS. AMAZON WANTS HEALTHCARE PAYPAL WANTS TO ADMINISTER THE TREASURY ETC ETC RFK JR TALKS ABOUT *CORPORATE CAPTURE* OF THE NIH AND THE FDA BY BIG PHARMA––– ISN'T ELON MUSK––DISMANTLING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE IN ORDER TO PRIVATIZE IT–– CORPORATE CAPTURE? / []
💜🙏💜 / []
❤️❤️❤️ / []
Idk how anyone can have an issue with any of this / []
You really have to be stupid dumb and cat litter crazy to disagree with DOGE!  And if your against it it’s cause your getting paid out of all the billions of dollars that’s been taken from the us citizens! / []
If you were to retire knowing alot, you might do well to submit as much as you may to help establish a bunch of records imbedded with substance that helps retain some sense and some references like clues which may serve others of the institute well as part of the ethos of leave the place in a better state than where you found it so to say, a bit of a play on self betterment as you might concider with replacementsnn. If you were to store some things a graduate may come to be aware of, where might you lay a ball point to reference a way as you will. If a Perfectionist, how might you find a gem in the rough.  🤔 / []
I agree with Elon on spring Ukraine. We have our own problems we need to take care of it own before we can try to take care of others lol at all or veterans on the streets. Along for a dollar on almost every street corner of it cities and people just drive right by like they don't exist. / []
but will law enforcement then look at who has swindled the government and try to prosecute them? they really should!  Though I'm betting there's not enough prison cells.. / []
Hopefully Elon is not getting played / []
Great interview❤🤔 / []
I am curious how many people living people are actually even on social security. / []
Democrats are very upset that babies can't get million dollar loans from our federal government anymore / []
That man is a moron. He's cutting everything except for his government contracts. He didn't get rich off of SpaceX and Tesla. / []
I just want to say thank you to DOGE. Really. May God bless and be with you. Thank you for caring about our country. / []
Absolutely wonderful, we are blessed to have these fine people aiding us / []

How he can blocked the hacker on my phone ? It anti personnal right and terrified . He don't even stop hacker from his phone though😂 . Whole money withdrawal from congress .legally vote by senate chamber ,too funny it frude by policy that all / []
I am 72 years old and I am on Social Security and I Have full faith in Elon Musk , with my Social Security number and all my information ! Way more than I trust anyone in the Congress or the Senate ! Because They are the reason Americans are 36 Trillion dollars in debt ! Because of Their Corruption ! And Stupidity ! And The only reason they are in Government as a Congress person or Senator is for Power and the opportunity to become Millionaires like Nancy Peloci and Diane Feinstein and others that have used their positions in the Congress and the Senate to rip off We The American People ! There are very few Congress members and Senators that haven’t broken the Oaths of office to obey and defend The Constitution and the Bill of Rights ! I believe More than half of them have committed Treason and are Completely And Totally Corrupt and belong in Prison ! / []
I bet the US government cannot afford to retire more than 8000 American citizens per year. They’ve already blown all the money that was set aside for Social Security and all the golden Fort Knox is gone. The US really needs a new government. / []
The people that need to watch this won't. They just want to cry😂 / []
We have dozens of departments at the NIH, dozens of CIOs within a single department...but one bank account across the entire federal government. That's...wow. / []
If you watch this entire interview and still come away thinking that Doge is the problem, then you are on the side of the enemies of the United States. Period. / []
Great team here doing great things. Liberals, especially their leadership, should be ashamed of their actions these past few months.  Pure evil motives driving the hate to protect their grifting. / []
Russian proxies/seditious Republican criminals. / []
Thank you Mr Elon Musk / []
When do we get to see the arrests of the criminals that have been stealing money. / ['I totally agree']
This Special Report w/Bret Baier is so important to every American!  These guys are so intelligent and caring about fixing decades of corruption.  We must defend these great businessmen at all costs. / []
Yes !!!!💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏 / []
They are giving back.  But we need to put the heat on CONGRESS and the SENATE to follow through. / []
GOD BLESS THIS PEOPLE.. / []
L❣️VE ELON👊👊👊 / []
All of you americans buy tesla to show support! / []
Sounds amazing at least till you actually start fact checking everything DOGE claims to have cut. / []
Someone ask Musk how much they'll cut from his subsidies. Ask about the Pentagons budget. / []
Where is the proof / []
Prove it YALL JUST TALKING NOT SHOWING THE evidence / []
Why was they looking at him before he started speaking the guy behind Elon Why are all of you hear you guys dnt have to be hear? Hmmmm rehearsed answers / []

Why won't more people of color go out and protest supporting those the left will not be able to call them racist you really don't see no people of color on the left side for this protest maybe they don't want to get involved if you believe in those speak your mind right now it's a good thing what Elon musk is doing until he does something to change my mind I'll support him and the d doge team / []
Elon Musk grew up in Apartheid South Africa, so incase you need a definition of what he wants in the USA: Definition: Apartheid was the system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994, resulting in severe restrictions and oppression for the black majority. / []
They are tring to devide the country with these paid rable rosers . SCHUMER even said thats what they must do go  after the magas / []
有点想/像证明自己呀。 / []
reducing the deficit is not enough. debt continues to grow. not only is deficit elimination necessary , spending must be reduced enough to allow for debt reduction.   No business or individual can handle their finances the way our government does.   It is ABSURD that our government does. IT IS CRIMINAL.   The same people that continuously vote our nation towards bankruptcy some see their net worth grow.   EXPLAIN THIS!!!??? / []
Why am I only hearing these DOGE updates on FOX news which used to be the epitome of fake news?  There must be other journalists/news agencies that are researching the truth vs. DOGE is doing almost the opposite of what FOX reports.  I've heard that many of the big news agencies have been PAID off, but there must be at least a couple E.G. as a scientist I'd be happy if at least three were reporting "similar truths."  It's hard to discuss the state of our nation with other Americans when they stopped watching FOX years ago! / []
You are looking at the people that are going to jail for Donald / []

How much usaid is Elon  getting for SpaceX Rockets / []
Why aren't you collecting more TAXES?  Collecting the $500 Billion a year owed by tax cheats would help reduce deficits and cut the impacts from the Doggies (DOGEs).  Instead firing thousand of IRS workers make the projected tax deadbeat non-collections to $1 Trillion per year!  End deficits, collect the money we are owed. / []
Must cut government spending, Thank you DOGE / []
They should have a Government Accountability Office that researches issues, brings them to congress and allows the government to rule on actions to improve the lives of Americans. Americans are funny / []
Imagine if all the networks, news outlets, talk shows and social media were behind trying to fix America. I can't believe how much push back and bad press these guys are getting when they are just trying to help fix America and make it better. Wow! What a sad time we live in. We need to put UNITED back in the United States. / []

Elon and his crew are completely lying. Elon is Scum / []
Elon does NOT produce anything - he is a very expensive middle man  who exploits other people's talent, labor, skill and time. How do you get to be a billionaire?  Simple, just subvert the politicians and underpay your employees and call it efficiency. / []
Even with the saving of one trillion - that is a drop in the ocean compared to the thousands of trillions embezzled by corporations in bed with politicians. / []

Thank you so much Elon Musk and this extraordinary DOGE team from a vert grateful American / []
I suggest we not listen to the democratic and woke narratives. They are poisoning our minds with "fear" that the DOGE are evil. They are cleaning the real garbage that the democrats created and generated. / []
DOGE is doing great things for America: despite the lies being told by the left! / []

Available federal contracting data does not show any individual contract valued at over $800 million awarded by the Department of the Interior over the last 17 years.The DOGE "wall of receipts" currently lists 366 cancelled contracts for the Department of the Interior; 199 of those are listed as $0 in savings. The total savings DOGE claims for the remainder adds up to only $144 million. / []
Thank you DOGE / []
There is now hope to prevent a complete national financial meltdown. / []

You guys are true angels, thank you. / []
For some unknown reason, I can not give a reply comment? To those asking why this is not aired nationally. It is. MfSM, which includes Fox News, is a national broadcast. If it is not being aired on other  MSM outlets that is because they refuse to cover it. The liberal media only covers the negative they create on DOGE or anything pertaining to POTUS Trump and his administration!! / []
They all have sharp focus like aliens / []

It always shocks me how casually people talk about $1bn.  It’s 1000 *$1m. In corporate land these are immense amounts of money to spend on projects.  I put it into man days for someone who charges $1000 a day and you have to imagine huge teams working for years. It’s insane / []

Leftist that equate this with an oligarchy are willfully lying. These men are not being paid- they are doing it because they’re high IQ individuals that like a challenge and have genuine care for the future of America. Many of them spoke of not wanting to leave this for their children. Do you ever hear democrats speak like that? Oligarchy is lifetime politicians fraudulently lining their pockets every change they get and making political decisions that keep them in power.

Our country has too many uneducated, hateful, people. The hatred is either requested by the manipulators who reward their  " employees " for achieving expected results ..like burning Tesla cars.

You haven’t seen the Revolution yet.  Musk, you are telling people to go back to their countries.  YOU need to drag your a** back to South Africa, the Moon, anywhere but America.  You and Trump are unabashedly draft dodgers.  You are whiny and care nothing for the American people.  If you did care, you would be pushing for a flat income tax so you would be paying your fair share.  There are legal remedies for those who steal a minor’s SSN.  I know because my ex-husband did that to my son.  It took about a year, but there was a legal avenue to correct it.  Trump is overspending.  He’s talking about starting wars with half our allies.  None of his offspring will be on the front lines.  Barron is 18 and legally should have registered with Selective Service.  Canada has said we are no longer their ally.  Mexico has Trump by his huevos.  The United States loses again with Trump’s intended tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports to America.  We’re not going to get out of this without a real upheaval.  I’m proud of the younger generations that are finally seeing the danger of this Executive regime.  I believe Americans will fight with their dying breath for freedom. / []

I like to have an open mind about what is being said on both sides and I am largely in support of cost cutting measures in areas that are wasteful, however every time Musk talks about the millions of non existent people receiving social security when that is clearly not true, it makes me question the validity of everything else you say. It's like the boy who cries wolf. One lie or exaggeration makes everything else seem untrue when it probably is not. How many of those millions are actually RECEIVING benefits. You are making it sound like these are all fraudulent claims when the more likely case is they are simply people still listed on an antiquated system who are not receiving a thing. / []

We, the people, are more than just the national debt and technological shortcomings.

Remember, these people calling horrible names and screaming the loudest are the ones that have something to lose with this DOGE process. If you KNOW that, when you see it happen, it weakens their resolve. / []
WRONG   A $232 million cut at the Social Security Administration. Here, Mr. Musk’s organization appeared to have mistakenly believed that the agency had canceled a huge information technology contract with the defense contracting giant Leidos. Instead, as reported by The Intercept, it had canceled only a tiny piece of it: a $560,000 project to let users mark their gender as “X.” The DOGE site now shows that small cut instead. / []
Paper can sometimes be much better than data which disappears. / []
Adagio for Strings van Mark Sixma / []
WRONG – these moron don't even KNOW HOW TO AUDIT an organization:  Three $655 million cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development. This was actually a single cut that was erroneously counted three times, as first reported by CBS News. That mistake also seemed to reflect a misunderstanding of the way government contracts work; they sometimes have “ceiling values” far in excess of what will be spent. Experts said this cancellation was unlikely to produce anything close to $655 million in savings even once. Now, the site lists a much smaller savings for these three cancellations: $18 million in total. / []
WRONG The "Doge" cut listed an 8 BILLION cut, when it was actually 8 million.   An $8 billion cut at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The actual contract in question was worth $8 million. The mistake seemed to stem from an earlier, erroneous entry in a federal contracting database. But contracting experts said that the service should have known better: ICE’s entire budget is about $8 billion, making it implausible that one contract could be so large. The U.S. DOGE Service adjusted the figure on the site after The Times wrote about it, and said in a post on Mr. Musk’s X platform that it had “always used the correct $8M in its calculations.” / []
I'd like to offer my humble gratitude to the DOGE team and especially to Elon. Thank you so so much! / []

You guys are all idiots, laws exist to prevent unilateral action. Trump is ignoring those laws since Justice Roberts gave him immunity. Unilaterally cutting through the government without working with Congress as a check/balance because of “the power of the executive branch”, you are an authoritarian. This is what it looks like. I just want the right-wingers to own that they’re authoritarian, don’t pretend like this is legal. / []
Whos goin prison for fking us pedos & left & rt theives / []
WE LOVE YOU ELON MUSK AN TRUMP!!!! THANK YOU AT THE HIGHEST OF THANK YOU'S FOR HELPING FIX THEIR BS!!!! OUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU 2 SOOOO BADDDD 😢😊 / []

In 83 I was station in Sicily, my roommate was in supply.  He came in with a bunch of catalogs and said I need to spend 50k tonight so we can keep our budget from the past year.  We drank beer and spent 50k.  Government entities do not want to lose their budget and will waste money to keep it.  And if possible get a higher budget next year. / []
Anyone else notice Steve Davis talks like Elon a little bit? Hangout together to much 😅 / []
THANK YOU…THANK YOU….THANK YOU….THANK YOU…JUST THANK YOU. / []
I’m sorry but where are the 19 and 21 year olds because the men I see are varied age.  Dems are just hysterical. / []
Long time coming great stuff / []
This is too logical for most to understand / []
Get into the unemployment program payments. Because during Covid shutdowns the jailbirds were stealing money from people. And my husband couldn’t even get online to file his true claim. The unemployment system would toss you out of the system if you took to long doing your claim. / []
B.S. / []
She’s a joke. / []
I hope that there will be accountability for this fraudulent spending, these politicians have a whole lot of money from a job that doesn’t make them that wealthy! / []
11:52 this is why I love Elon! Genuine human. / []
👹🐀 🗣👅😈 / []
Musk and his team trying to convince all of you that he's not benefitting from this, is absurd. He's gaining more government contracts and receiving more grants and subsidies than ever before. He eliminated government agencies that were investigating him. He just got every US citizens' sensitive information. Last time I checked, our personal data is very valuable to the tech sector.   And the worst part is that Trump created this problem and he's allowing it to get worse. I don't blame him. It's smarter to let Elon break everything and be hated, so less people will focus on Trump's own failures. / []
I want to see a modern day response to one of these videos. E.g. X person reacts to ___ video.  Rather than seeing a debate (them just attacking eachother) we can see the other persons thoughts with hopefully attached evidence.  Acts as both video accountability (we can refer back to what they said in the future and see if it was true) and also an ease of access/transparency. / []
I want to personally thank President Trump. I wanna thank Elon Musk. I wanna thank the administration. I wanna thank God and I want to ask most of all that God bless America again. God help us to get on the right track once again in Jesus name. I pray I ask to protect all of these involved and protect those working so hard at DOGE. I really appreciate the transparency. Please don’t stop your hard work. I’m praying for you all. / []
It’s all a lie and it’s taking money from hard working people to give the rich BOTTOM LINE!!! / []
FING LIARS DEPORT MUSK AND TO THINK PEOPLE VOTED FOR THIS CRAP!! GOOD RIDDANCE THERES A REVOLUTION HAPPENING / []
Gurrrl, why haven't you shown up to any of the meetings that have been held in Congress? This is total B.S. / []
Everyone asking why it isn’t being shown here or there. You need to learn how they keep us divided and most definitely conquered. Nothing is as great as you think and when your all using your digital I.d. and currency in your smart cities and ai has took over most, maybe it might actually hit you what happened in the background / []
What about yo 3:10 ur gain and contracts 🤔 🎉 / []
America is trash TREASON criminals using STOLEN CORP money 🤑 / []

Elon Musk is a good man. / []
Its a PROMISE / []
Why democrats are against this amazing work / []
What are they fighting for?!?!? They seriously have to ask that? They are fighting for their sovereignty, their democracy, their freedom. F’ing idiot. / []
I hope Elon never backs down. He is an example of the unique quality of American heroism. / []
Being a veteran does not exempt one from treason, just ask Benedict Arnold. / []
Why didn't Trump do this in his first administration? / []
You are a hero!❤ / []
Thank You!!!!!! / []
Let’s go Trump and Musk MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!! / []
AMERICA DOES AGREE. WE ARE FKNG BROKE AND TIRED. / []
We love you Elon and Doge people 🎉   Some want the savings to go toward "slave reparations." / []
I don't trust AI ....I don't want any computer to be talking to me... building computers to make them more human is playing GOD in our lives / []
Anyone who doesn't want more efficiency and progress.  Should go live in a backward country.  Imagine if USA went bankrupt they would be  the first to blame Trump even if he had not won.!! Well done team !!! Keep going team stop all the rip offs !! / []
I salute DOGE and the team for their expertise and dedication. Thank you.  USA loves Trump and Musk. In Trump and Musk we TRUST!!! / []
The level of competence on this panel is far too much for the federal government 😂 / []
God bless the DOGE team!!!❤❤❤ / []
Almost 6M views, keep on sharing! / []
Fox News! Thank you for this interview! / []
Cool. Meanwile Trump golfs up all the savings. / []
Reduce deficit by one thousand billions☆😂☆We the people want a leaner/cleaner federal government. / []
Why did the federal spending increase so much over the last two months? I get what Musk is saying but it doesn't line up with the facts. Why doesn't he ask that question? / []
They all look like racists they just trying to protect their money / ['Isn’t it racist to assume they are because their white? Racism isn’t a skin color it’s a mental disorder. Anybody can be racist.']
BS…….they are ruining social services for American citizens / []
17:53 - focus on compassion? Not if you worked at USAID or at the Consumer Protection Bureau.  I would love for them to just be truthful / []
There is a lot of opportunities in the private sector for redundant government employees. They can move on to very good and possibly better paying positions. / []
We owe all these people a tremendous debt. Thank you is all I have although it's woefully short. God bless you! / []
Stop cutting off these people we wanna hear their answers / []
1B$ for a survey? That's crazy. / []
Shame on the elected government officials that have STOLLEN all of this money from the Americans that have trusted them!!! / []
They're probably also getting paid to burn Tesla. It's sad, some people are seriously lacking morels. Your not hurting Tesla your hurting customers. Just regular people. / []
I hope these gentlemen have very good security. There are a lot of sick and crazy Leftists out there. / []
DOGE and Elon are freaking amazing. Thank you DOGE. / []
Americans want and need their money back, since the corruption started, we need it. / []
Sounds like leftys just wanna keep there money schemes going / []
Going great for MAGA!! Best wishes for cleaning all kind of financial and social fraudlent and punishing those culprits. Honest governments should take lessons and follow these steps for making their country also great. / []
This is a must watch for every citizen in every country on God's green earth. And every citizen ought to demand this from their governments! / []
China and Russia like this selfdestruction ... a lot. / []

Still haven’t received my refund from 2 and 3 years ago. And since this started they stole 60% of this years current refund. Elon and team look into my social cause people even divorced relatives have all had there pickings at it / []
Doge and Elon did a great job for Americans. 👏 👏 👏 / []
Great interview!!! / []
AMERICA SOLVENT IN THE NAME OF JESUS MAGA  2030!!!!!!! / []
God help us! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
How come the DOGE team gets to make the decisions with no input from the congress or the American people? / []
strange, but I don't see any of the 19 yr olds geeks in this interview / []
This is so refreshing and we are so lucky that we have such a group of talents who are volunteering their skills and time to help us the Americans to see how our money is being spent!  Oh my goodness!  How can anyone with a right mind or even with 10% of sanity can go against this effort!  I worked for Federal Reserve entity and there are 12 districts plus the Board of governors.  We tried to consolidate the 12 districts technology centers to 3 … then due to politics or whatever, we ended up with 12 technology centers and the 3 central technology centers PLUS individual business areas create their own mini technology teams. When the DOGE team talks about the redundant work and with 40+ CFO actually the self proclaimed CTO reminded me so much of what was happening in my past life.  Unbelievable!!!!  Go DOGE!!! / []
Interesting there was no effort to curtail government inefficiency during Trump's first term.  Does need to be addressed, but how much of this money DOGE is apparently saving's going back into the pockets of the American people? 🙄 / []
Elon Musk is a brilliant American!!👏👏👏💪💪✊️✊️👏👏👏 / []
Absolutely the FAR Left has been spoon feeding propaganda to those who will listen!! / []
Time to do a Doge Documentary with actual scenes, locations actors in certain circumstances.  Doge must continue in time with referrals and agency reporting to improve systems, law enforcement Report. / []
If these guys pull off what they're trying to do. These men need to recognized as national heroes. / ['Yes and faces on Rushmore not trump', '\u200b@gloriabailey6170\nTrump TOO!!', '“I love the poorly educated”', 'According to reporting in the Washington post, massive cuts to IRS staff involved in corporate tax enforcement have caused them to project a revenue decrease of about 10% just due to uncollected taxes this year. That amounts to about $500 billion, which is way more than the savings DOGE can make up for via cutting staff.\n\nMaking government work better and more efficiently is something that basically no one disagrees with. But these guys are clearly going after agencies (like USAID) based on a political agenda. Add to that the massive conflicts of interest involved with musk specifically, whose companies have significant contracts with the government.\n\nThis is just billionaires remaking government for the benefit of their own companies  - nothing more or less.', '\u200b@gloriabailey6170 , without Trump DOGE and Musk, along with his team would not be doing anything of this. So Yes, Trump deserves a spot on MT. Rushmore.']
Long live Mr. Big Balls! 🎉 / []
Reality says that LIbs won't watch this. They have been "brain"washed not to believe anything reported by anyone other than the MSDNC. They are beyond distinguishing reality from demspeak. / []
President Trump, his cabinet  and Elon Musk with his DOGE team are the most formidable force for good in America we’ve ever seen.  Please keep up the great work you are doing and disregard the naysayers.  You are on the right side of history! / []
It’s so bittersweet to see the Republicans and Trump’s get what they deserve. I love sitting in Argentina and the Rocky Mountains watching you all have to pay higher prices for everything. Well, my dollar to pay so conversion is excellent and no tariffs no price increases and food is rather cheap / []

So sad that people steal 😢 / []
I want to know if all these people who have been cashing checks on behalf of dead people are going to be PROSECUTED? / []
Loved the cat and Cyprus is beautiful! Thanks / []
If you cannot comprehend what doge is doing you, then you are part of the problem.. bottom line a good example of what needs to be done is very simple. Just like back in the day states did not share information local governments did not share information concerning crimes now we have codis, and we also have access to DNA databases and look at all the crimes that have been solved for 30 40 50 years old, this could have been done a long time ago they are intensely sabotaging the system and raping every American taxpayer and anybody who pays taxes should Beyond thrilled that they are still around to be part of this long overdue government overhaul / []

Elon Musk is a trie hero to America.  A busy brilliant person doing this for free. HE KNOWS HOW TO EFFICIENTLY DO THIS.

MANY of these depts and positions/workers  are unnecessary! THANK YOU MR MUSK!! / []
Support these American hero's. / []
We shouldn't have to pay any tax until the people responsible for this crap are charged and arrested / []
I believe Trump said he would deal with inflation and high prices on DAY ONE !!   Now he doesn't care that his tariffs are raising prices. / []
We love you Elon / []
God bless these guys. Very important work / []
Further information to confirm the insanity of those who oppose Elon, Trump and DOGE. The revolution to save the country. / []
This Truly Gives Me Hope For A Brighter Better Future !! / []
If President Musk has found all this corruption, why has nobody been charged.? THINK about that. / []
If Democrats are mad about DOGE making cuts to federal spending then they should’ve made the cut themselves under a democratic administration. Now we’re doing it so you’re gonna have to deal with it now. / []
I have a mobile home park at Jacksonville, NC. Can I get info on Tesla Tiny House? / []
People, please don’t be so gullible! Because you see white business men and one non white business man you think you’re hearing truth! Don’t be so gullible and bamboozled! How come the youngsters running DOGE are not there? Huh? Wake up? I like Brett Bayer and watch him often, probably the only reporter on Fox that has some modicum of self dignity, the rest of Fox News is full of lies and propaganda! Please people, with Trump, question everything! Trump and all he’s associated with or touches is far from TRUTH! / []

Only one remark regarding Ukraine. Ask yourself, does Russian elite care about its people dying? Do they care that their kids are without dads? They are not like westerns... So, please reconsider your approach/ understanding who you are dealing with. The basis for human life preserve is not the same for us and for Russian elites :-( ... They are NOT like you, Elon. / []

wow - well we now see why democrats scream LOUD - because they are getting rich off this system and loophole. AAHH no wonder. / []
I know that there's alot of ppl in prison "prisoners" that file dead peoples tax returns and scam all the time / []
Let me get this straight, the answer to fixing outdated computer and filing systems is to fire innocent Americans trying to do their jobs, use the money and update the old systems. Then you go on a propaganda outlet to talk about how the other side uses propaganda to attack your businesses. Then you put in a contract with the federal government for 700 million dollars to buy your crazy looking cars and computer systems while telling the American people that you're doing your job for free. / []

Please repeat this discussion with the Doge team in 30 more days, then put it in a prime time slot. Then, repeat the broadcast in 30 more days and when it ends. This is so important to the country. / []
As a fan of DOGE and of what they are doing - I think his definition of a traitor is way off.  A traitor is someone who sells his country out.   For example, giving military secrets to the Germans in WWII or providing intelligence to the Soviets during the cold war.  Putting another countries interest ahead of the US is a far way from selling out the US -- and is rather subjective.  On the other hand - I totally agree with him about the horrors of pointless wars that accomplish nothing but killing a lot of people. / []
Amen / []
All that money goes to the obamas wallet and hillary / []
Thank you DOGE team!! / []
No wonder the democrats are so mad and spreading lies allover the mainstream media they cannot scam the American people it's over / []

I'm on dialysis & I've been waiting for my End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Medicare application to be approved since Oct 3, 2024.   1 month BEFORE the election!  I filed at my local SSA in person & was told my paperwork was in order & I would get a Medicare number online within 24 hrs & a card in the mail in 3-5 budiness days.  I'm still waiting... Endless phone calls, different agents different excuses.  Everyone i talk to at SSA says give it 30 days. How many 30 day periods do they need?  Mar 7, 2025, I was told my medicare application is "stuck" in the Phila Payment Center. I cant find the right person to complete it or who can get it completed.  This is a time sensitive issue. How? My 30 month insurance waiting period ends on May 1, 2025 when Medicare is MANDATED to be my primary insurance & my private insurance becomes secondary.  Dialysis is not cheap. My oncology team & kidney transplant team that treats me at the University of Pennsylvania are also not cheap.  DOGE, Elon - can anyone help? / []
Thank you for doing something. Im proud to have as my fellow Americans. Keep up the good work. God bless you. / []
They are BS ing you / []

Never been more proud to be an American and a maga supporter, getting everything I voted for and more, god bless this country 🇺🇸 / []

Who cries the loudest  on what Elon is finding? Anyone know the answer Boys and Girls? / []
The people that are working with the democratic party are hurting their own families and themselves,  in the end of the democrats actions are going to bankrupt our country and our social security so you nor your parents or grandparents going to have any money,  nor will you, so what are you going to retire on for money? Are you all that stupid that you can't see the end results of what the democrats ate really doing? They have lied to you for years now, and you can not see the truth thre all of the BS they throw at you? Tell me 6 things that the democrats have really done for you or our country that have really benefited anything from!! How about your families? What benefits have the democrats have really done to make their lives easier?  The democratic party is DEAD, wake-up protesters,  you're not seeing the weeds through the grass. If you can't admit you're wrong to the public, at least be honest with yourselves and trun your anger toward the democrats that have used you, lied to you and have done more harm to you and your families financially than anyone else ever has. They were giving the illegal immigrants your Social security payments,  allowing free money, housing,  paying them for jobs they really didn't have.  What did you get for money, free housing,  free medical, free travel, free, free, free, that's what they gave the illegal immigrants and you and your families got higher taxes, higher food costs,  higher medical,  higher medications costs,  higher gasoline costs,  higher home heating costs, someone has to pay for all the illegal immigrants free stuff, it was you and you're families.  DUH !!! And here you are protesting for the enemy.  DUH !!! WAKE UP !!!🤬 / []

Hello, could you please tell me if Property Management companies would be on the list?? These companies are ripping people off every day, bullying people who are renting from them, saying if you don't like it move.

This is how you earn taxpayers' trust / []
Why would anyone don't like this unless they're not profiting / []
I’m going to buy every man on that panel a red cape! / []
Amazing interview! / []
I don't understand how people can argue against this... / []
I find it fascinating to watch and hear about quite a revolutionising way of rectifying a  problem you're government has been enduring and to see a likelihood of a positive Outcome brings hope to other countries who might see themselves in such a dire situation and now have the ability to  put something into action tto decompose the problem and in state some of the solutions that are righteous and truthful to be precisely that. on a final notes I'll be completely honest I had full faith in Elon's interest and commitments in this Endeavour and so from a selfish point of view I do hope that most all or everything is rectified light speed so Elon can get back to Space with his mind's Body & Soul Spirit having the Maestro back at the helm would be great to have  with his assertiveness in the direction he primarily finds enjoyment and continues to be part of a solution. from the other side of the Earth that's quite obvious that Master Elon is requirements of  the people who wish to be the dreamers aand believers again space is a big place and there's a lot of work to be done and a lot of great minds and intellects with solutions and fascination and imagination ride across the planet. I think SpaceX should be expanded and I mean International Space Airport. is the right Technologies at all their correct respective progress points for a bite or two at a revolutionary movement forward in Technologies that are required to have meaning in our lifetimein all the seriousness in the world? any leaps in the Aerospace & astronautics would be not only beneficial forthe few it would be beneficial for the manyto the point of necessity: / []
Elon is so right in all he does and says  its refreshing to hear him and the team around President TRUMP ,lets us hope here in the   U K REFORM. gets into goverment sooner than later to get us out of the mess were in / []

Happy to know someone is finally auditing and making the changes necessary / []
Bunch of fooools😂😂😂 / []
I will say this. I don't like Trump (at all), but I think this is a very bold mission and I hope they succeed. I hope everything they are saying in this interview is correct and they fix these systems for the good of the American people. / []

OH. MY. GOD.  Where are the democrats getting the information that they're crying about???  Or are they literally making things up??  This is unbelievable!!  I've actually been waiting for an interview with Elon to speak the facts about what he and his team are ACTUALLY DOING but this is even better. This group of highly intelligent and competent men simply CORRECTING ERRORS AND DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE!!!  Thank the Lord for these guys. Wow. Really it just boggles my brain to know that their are so many corrupt individuals spreading lies about these good people. And THE SADDEST PART IS. . THE IDIOTS WHO ARE COMPLAINING WILL ALSO DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE CORRECTIVE WORK OF TEAM ELON!!!   Thanks sooooo much TEAM ELON FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THE TRUTH AND BEING GOOD GUYS!!!  I haven't seen anything like this in so long (maybe ever) except in the movies haha / []

I agree that everyone in the country should see this, and know that most of the people making decisions about the future of people working for the Government are white males.   And again, I have not in anyway seen evidence that these people know anything about the responsibilities of the people they recommend for termination.  Some of those people could have responsibilities over select agents, which are as deadly as nuclear bombs, but harder to safeguard. / []
It not just the federal government it state governments using technology built in the 1960s has not been updated alll along. Sad 😢 beyond sad.

Thank you, Elon Musk for that statement.  ""We are going after the ones who are pushing this fake propaganda we are coming for you !!""  It makes me so upset that our government is fighting our president !!!!!  If Biden would've won, we wouldn't be out there burning stuff. We would be probably complaining, but we wouldn't be forming teams to protest and sending all this money to protest. What the current elected president is doing. He's the president. / []

I've had two friends come out talking crap about it and I said what I'm actually proud to be an American again from what Trump and what Elon has done. I know Trump would straighten something out I didn't imagine this at this rate and Elan is a genius he is one of a kind thinks outside of the box I think he's amazing.

If the Doggies are about efficiency then why is it only about cutting spending?  Doesn't efficiency mean "run better"?  So for the IRS "run better" means collecting more in taxes from Billionaire and Millionaire tax deadbeats.  Still waiting for these announcements! / []

I strongly doubt Ukrainians think their soldiers are dying for nothing. Weird how some people, like Musk, fail to see that Ukraine is fighting for it's existense as a free nation and a free people.  What Musk is saying is that if a large country, for instance one that starts with a 'C', should attack the US, then the US shouldn't fight back, cause that would just lead to more deaths. I'm pretty sure the people of USA would fight for their country, so why are they questioning the Ukrainian's will to do the same? / []

Elon Musk handing out $1M checks tied to petition signing should raise red flags for everyone. If this were a politician doing it, we’d call it bribery. Why is it different when a billionaire does it? Paying people around elections isn’t just shady—it undermines democracy / []
Anyone who grew up in the Washington DC area should be able to tell you that this is long overdue. Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock or just plain lying to themselves already knows that this is a major problem and it should have been dealt with a long time ago. If they tell you otherwise they are ignorant or just plain lying. Most people have at least a government employee or two in their family and it's hard not to living in that area with so many federal government employees. I mean we honestly have to stop lying to ourselves and just admit that we need to do something and this is exactly what needs to be done / []
It really restores faith in americans when you are transparent like this with these brilliant dudes. / []

Everyone in this interview (presumably the entire team) is white and male. That alone raises an issue of informed decision making and it’s inefficient. Check scholars and research on this topic (from Oxford to Harvard).   You will find:  Diversity in decision-making teams is crucial when outcomes affect broad and varied populations. Teams composed of individuals from different backgrounds bring a wider range of perspectives, experiences, and problem-solving approaches, which helps to identify blind spots, reduce groupthink, and better anticipate the needs of diverse communities. From an intellectual and professional standpoint, diverse teams often make more accurate decisions and do so more efficiently by challenging assumptions early and uncovering better solutions faster. This leads to more robust, inclusive, and implementable strategies. Key benefits include: •Faster identification of risks and opportunities across demographic lines •More innovative and adaptable problem-solving •Increased trust and legitimacy in decisions among stakeholders •Reduction in costly missteps from overlooked perspectives / []

MISTAKES???? It didn't occur to you that firing our top nuclear employees might be a blunder before you did it? And how many other similar scenarios?

This is a lie, brought on by the overwhelming unpopularity of this administration's actions on the economy. Florida district 6 indicators caused them to rescind Sephanik's nomination because they fear losing the majority in the House. Don't believe a word they say. Watch what they do. They will say anything to stay in power, and then continue corporate welfare (taking $ OUT of your pocket). They made it clear that these cuts will be used for tax cuts for the most wealthy. Look what they did when handed a growing economy (from Obama). They gave huge tax cuts to them without a means to pay for it. Did it trickle down? Where? Who got it? Nobody. They are liars. Otherwise, why would Musk refer to social security as a  Ponzi Scheme? This is nothing more than an attempt at damage control. PAY ATTENTION!!!!!! / []

Musk bought the U.S government. He has succeeded in "uncovering" what people already knew, the government spend money on the wrong thing, what he missed was all the money he and all the other super rich get from the government and in the process he has killed all the organisations that were investigating him and the other James Bond villains.

People keep calling Elon scammer... but the truth is, nobody in the federal government ever has published the a trillion dollar budget of federal government. We understand how budge works, it's money we put down as how much we'll spend, not necessarily spending them, but still it's money that will be spent or be wasted, we'd like to know how it was spent. Surely if the budge is a trillion this year, it's at least 900 billion last year, so how was the money spent last year? The federal government has never shown the accounting ledger to its citizen or tax payer.  Tax-payer wants to know how the trillion is spent; the problem is that the federal government was shut down a couple of times in the past without even know how those money were spent. Sure, it might not have been a-830-million dollar all going to the national park survey, but if that's what is planned for 2025, where did similar funds went in 2024? Just by saying that Elon is inaccurate because no contract has yet taken that amount out doesn't stop the fact that near a trillion dollar is wasted somewhere in the years building up to this past election...   If the federal government cannot release the full ledger, then at least give us an example of how it was spent for different department... if showing accounting for the defense department is unsafe for national security, how about you do it for the fire department and for the department of interior... how were those couple of millions of dollar spent? who were they given to and how did it improve our life? why was it necessary? do it for the past decade, don't let it be a democrat-only-problem.... but if you cannot produce such result, even for the fed under Trump's first term, then it's probably very shady and have things you guys don't want to show, and therefore IT IS better be shut down by DOGE. Elon at least don't need to take the fed's money, and we trust him to reveal anything that is unclear or shady to the public. / []
The plan is they Weaken the country by 2027 and next will be weaken the military budget so china can surpass the military faster so they can invade Taiwan by 2027 so trump can stay in office longer when election time rolls around / []

Need a half trillion surplus to actually reduce the debt. Reducing the deficit just means we slow down how fast we continue to go into deeper debt. Need to grow that surplus annually until its 1.5 trillion a year surplus to reduce national debt by that amount annually.

Just curious, what if it comes out that the Biden security officials used signal to discuss the withdrawal from Afghanistan?  Will you condemn it equally,  We know that Biden approved the use Signal and we know signal is one of the most secure, end to end encrypted platform. I think Pete Hegseth got over excited and arrogant and ignored security protocols.  Leaders take responsibility. They are accountable they don’t point fingers, they put the country ahead of their ego, they’re not defensive.  I’m maga and I’ve lost confidence in him.  I want someone stoic, wise, experienced, someone who takes responsibility to be the SecDef.  I’m embarrassed by Hegseth. Yes democrats have done things similar or worse than this.  So what?

This is staggering misinformation as usual enabled and broadcast by Fox. Why didn’t this panel present themselves in front of a public oversight committee I wonder? There were virtually no questions that highlight just why so many people are so angry that government agencies and federal government is being brutally dismantled without proper and careful insight and oversight. This PR exercise by the likes of Elon and all there was text book gaslighting. Astonishing! Elon and Doge don’t care and don’t believe in checks and balances. Elon has always operated like a lying rampaging tyrant in business. To those that don’t know what he’s really like, he comes across in this interview as someone who really cares! So many people are fooled by liars like Elon and Trump, who are only out to save their own skins. / []

Look at all the people who are absolutely certain what he's doing is definitely going to be great. There's no way they would know that. Let's face it there's really no way to know if what he's doing will do any good or not. It will be months or a year. If anyone claims that they are absolutely sure they know it will be great are just are just buying it hook line and sinker. No one really knows. Some of his moves so far have been proven to be bad decisions and they have had to go back and re-hire people so I not impressed yet. The thing that DOES stand out is his weird behavior. He gets kinda crazy like a spastic little kid about stuff. Not exactly re-assuring. Oh well, I guess we'll find out. / []

Love the passion from Elon there at the end. He's right; thousands of people die every week and the borders are the same as in 2023. They die for nothing. It shows he's a caring and honest man.

If they can save a trillion ,then they need to merge the federal reserve with the treasury, and save another trillion . Another half a trillion can be saved on defense by closing several hundred of the 1100 overseas bases and maybe a couple thousand of the 6,000 Bases inside the US. And then there is health care, where we spend as a country 5 trillion per annum .  Single payer medicare for all would cover everyone and eliminate the medical billing industry that takes about 1/3 of it.  Medicare does not pay hospitals the ridiculous bills that private insurers get soaked for.  This could make America cost competitive in manufacturing again, as about a third or more of labor costs are for private health insurance for people under 65, which is 87% of the population of the country. / []
Godspeed and God bless, Trump, Elon, and every good and moral soul involved with DOGE working tirelessly and patriotically to save the USA!   They are fighting on the side of God and good in this spiritual battle against Satan and evil. Pray daily for God's protection over Trump and Elon! / []

They have the right intentions and all the waste and problems that they brought up in this video are legitimate, however he didn't address the biggest criticism, there were national park rangers that were fired after 20 years on the job, were they part of government waste? Sounds like Hatchet not scalpel to me.  One big issue that nobody touched on here is that Elon decides what's government waste and what isn't, he decides what job is essential and what isn't. There's no way that they can make these mass layoffs in such short time like this. It takes a long time to find out exactly what jobs are not needed and which ones are. For the guy who turned twitter into an unmoderated cesspool, this is very on brand. / []
We are seeing why the politicians didn't want this team in there.  The good old days from getting rich from public office through kick backs are over.  I appreciate the personal risk these people took to improve the financial and technical efficiency of our government. / []

The mission of DOGE is a  Luftschloss.  The German word "Luftschloss" translates literally to "air castle," but its figurative meaning is closer to "pipe dream" or "castle in the air" in American English. It refers to an unrealistic, impractical, or fantastical idea or plan that is unlikely to ever come to fruition. It describes something that exists only in imagination, with no real foundation in reality. / ['Just say “pipe dream” next time.', '@Right_Dude_Here thanks a lot for the clarification 3>\n\nUS-American English is not my first language (just one of the seven)']

Lastly, before I worked in equity research, I was in sales in Southern California years ago, and one of the businesses was my largest Hawaii customer, shipping product weekly to the U.S. Navy in Hawaii from San Pedro, CA. They charged an astronomical amount (product and freight bill) to the U.S. Navy, which purchased the product. I asked my customer, "Why do you charge so much to the U.S. government in terms of the product and freight invoice?" He said, "Because the Navy just pays the bill, they do not audit the bill". I said, "You do realize that other companies are paying about $220.00 per pallet with the same cube/density to Hawaii, and you're paying $1,000 + the product. He said that he did not care. He stated to me, "you enjoy the revenue and I enjoy the added margin from the U.S. Navy over-paying for the product and shipping." So it's about time someone did something about this. My only concern is that we are the world's reserve currency. This sheer neglect may tell those who hold our currency reserves, if the United States is this careless in their process to audit cash in/out, will they pay me the interest on some of the longer-term notes owed to me, coupled with my coupon payment. / []

We badly need to keep Social Security programs. See Below.  Social Security is an Insurance plan not an Investment plan.   Try Kindness:  On ABC Ch 7 News TV Sf Bay Area a homeless girl about a year ago  said," There are scarce Resources." I,myself, in the past before homeless girl's Report here had submitted a scarce Resources Report also. I have never been homeless and worked all my life.   Stereotyping is very sadly so much in error.   Bad landlords, the poor being the victims of crimes, fear of unsafe shelters, shelters with time limits like Welfare Programs, shelters for1 week only stay, shelters putting the homeless out all day that drags down homeless spirit, and unaware and uninformed people not knowing sad plight of the poor nor see  in person.   This is why we have the homeless.   Try Kindness nothing else works.   We must attend to bringing down the Federal Government Trillion deficit. Not  attending to needful Federal budget  Gov't deficit, it could be worse.   Although not in U.S. Constitution, Healthcare is a Right.  The "Right to Life", Liberty, and The Pursuit of Happiness which  cannot be obtained if do not exist and have no life.   Social  Security abounds in Myths. Other  people not just yourself Mr. Elon Musk  have thought it is a Ponzi scheme. But Social Security is an Insurance plan not an investment plan. President Donald Trump says he now knows  people have contributed to Social Security with their hard earned  money for decades.   The Good Lord and Jesus were kind to the poor and sick. / []

If we stop taxing those who make less than $1 million a year (reduce their federal taxes to 0%), and take half of every dollar that is made above $1 million from the rich, there would be no deficit and every American would have free health care, guaranteed housing, and would have their higher education paid for.  The reason we have a deficit is because men like Elon Musk refuse to pay their fair share while complaining how they are victims of the big bad government.  Under this system, the rich would still be rich and would be able to buy anything they could possibly want, and the rest of us would be fed, clothed, housed, and educated.  How can you be against that, Elon?  Oh, that's right, you can be against it because $100 billion is just not enough for you. / []

A DC Judge who’s working for a nonprofit? Who’s getting money from the government? Really? Yeah, and they’re eating the cats and dogs, too. Why  is Fox News not asking for proof of these preposterous statements? Why can’t Musk  give a single name for such a judge? Think critically, folks.

This is journalism? 26:48 Nope. This is advocacy. Do your job, Fox News. Do outside research. Ask hard questions. All you have to do, at the very least, is read other newspapers (WSJ, NYT, etc.,) for chrissakes. This is why no one trusts the press anymore. / []

Elon Musk shut down agencies and fired Administors and IGs who were conducting multiple investigations into his business!  They all went away!

Someone recently retired from the federal government— NOTHING was on paper for the federal annuity. Nothing. Strictly emails and the GRB site for filling out the forms, signing and uploading supporting electronic docs. NO TRAINING was offered or time to learn given. Access to GRB was available only from the government computer (forbidden to access from home) — there are hundreds if not thousands of links to terms and rules and laws). There was no way for the employee to verify anywhere whether the calculations were correct. Those employees still do not know whether the highest three years were chosen correctly. They learned literally in the last days of employment that those highest three years must be consecutive three years. Nowhere in FERS lit. was this highlighted.    The direct email person/contact relied on someone else (in the “mine”? ) to answer Qs. During work hours, employees were NOT able to engross themselves into studying ANY of this due to the demands of the sensitive job responsibilities. It was overwhelming. The employees just threw through their hands in the air. OPM kept saying “your agency is responsible for your retirement, information and whatever is needed”. Highly seemingly on purpose NOT organized, not accountable to the retiree…………: 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 / []

It’s an amazing goal I would work for free to help with this. I want everything digitalised so it’s at maximum efficiency and puts all the transparency and real-time information for all citizens and the government so that people don’t need to fill out forms by hand or wait in lines for ridiculous reasons.  I’m not even American, I’m British but I love this endeavour it’s so worthwhile I’ve done it for myself for my personal information and everything is more secure via advanced encryption and more convenient for me to grab my information. I’m a cybersecurity expert and honestly most things can be improved hugely via this method and it’s most cost effective for the American citizens / []
Absolutely Amazing interview! / []
This isn’t an interview it is a promotional ad for Doge.  I call BS.  Also, look at the comments. They are ALL positive.

Nice segment.  Keep up the good works. Unfortunately, many will never benefit from programs like social security.  Even after over paying taxes, social security and other wage deductions, many become targets of corrupt governing bodies (corrupted individuals and groups) that exploit these programs as forms of retaliation of perceived (imaginary) "threats."  Even if those being targeted have never been a "threat", and have likely endured numerous attacks from corrupt individuals and groups that abuse government agencies, there will likely be no resolution because the cost of defense in a corrupt legal system is not a possibility for nearly all of the working population. The right to a jury trial is replaced with corrupt arbitration or prewritten judge verdicts. Ultimately the falsely accused "threats" are added to future "witch hunts" (being added onto other corrupt persecution lists, mudding the water) while the corrupt individuals and groups never face prosecution for former evil acts. Yes, this is the way of silly folks. They truly are consumed by hate. They are one evil angry lot. If Trump, Elon and DOGE can help to clean up this mess, then that would be amazing. If the team can do that with out collateral damage, then that would be a miracle. Cleaning up evil in a world generally managed and played by evil folks is certainly a challenge. Let the Father's will be done. Regardless, all remains well. Best to all.  Thanks for sharing. / []
DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP THE FEAR MONGERING!!!!!!!!!!! / ["Trump told Bob Woodward that fear equals power!   Trump told us we should fear the media, law enforcement, the FBI, the CIA, the Democrats, Obama, Hillary.  In what ways are the Democrats fear mongering!\nTalk is cheap, let's see results;"]

Public sector is getting a dose of what it's like to work in private sector.  And they don't like it.  I serviced some federal accounts for a large computer company.  Dealt with IRS, SSA, CM&M, and NASA.  The waste I saw, was the enormous time wasted by federal employees during their workday.  They lacked a sense of accomplishment.  You know the old saying, "Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."  In public sector it's just the opposite. / []

Can I have one of those government credit cards. Shoot the newtechnology i would create would change the face of the world.

Let me have a gov credit card.  The pfas deep aquifer clean up.s3eds to health biofewd back monitoring to space travel through quatum pulse technology would litterally change the face of the world.   I just don't have the capital.needed to produce it.

These men speak as if corporations have always had the best interests of people in mind over their own personal profits.  And yet we KNOW that corporations, ESPECIALLY oil companies, have repeatedly lied to the American people, sacrificing millions of lives a year in order to line their own pocketbooks.    The definition of fascist oligarchy is exactly what's happening at DOGE.   I am all for cutting government waste. But that waste needs to go through a process of due diligence so vital services like disease prevention, nuclear safety and air travel can be protected.  The claims of precision, compassion and caution have already been proven to be false. Planes are still falling out of the sky and  the spread of Aids, even to children has been greatly exacerbated because of the DOGE cuts.   This is why proposed cuts need to be approved by CONGRESS as part of the democratic process.   If you really want to cut waste, slash the trillions of dollars in corporate subsidies, not medicaid and vital services to those who need it most. / []
I love Elon Musk!!!   I may not be so smart but I love listening to smart kind honest people!   I do have to say though, I hate technology ! / []

Americans and their stupidity on display as US Oligarchs steal their money. Social Security benefits are determined by Congress, not Elon Musk or DOGE. Laying off workers and agencies to pay for the $5 trillion permanent tax cuts for the Oligarchs. If you want to save the American taxpayers money, cancel Elon Musk's welfare check from DOD . We already have NASA for our space program. NASA landed man on the moon long before Elon Musk was born in Apartheid South Africa in 1971. We don't need to award Elon Musk $150 billion dollars Welfare check to crash Rockets over the Pacific.. / []
Elon is president / []
Elon should be president / []
Wonderful news! So appreciate these patriots! / []
It cant be any more worse than the old system. / []
“Casually”… a billion dollars. Sickening. Go get ‘em DOGE! Take 1,300 days if needed! / []
If billionaires paid their taxes we wouldn't have to cut benefits for the needy, sick 😂or seniors. (this has been going on since the income tax was switched from wartime aid to "let's change this to - tax people all the time and there will be more $$$ for us!" And why are ex president's and polititions given retirements so they live like multi-millionaires? You might have some wires stripped and crossed. / []
The doge teem should keep going and looking. For froude. / []
I wonder to what extent our friends the unions are part of the cause of this car crash / []
Elon: I thank you from the bottom of my heart!! / []
interesting / []
EXCELLENT interviews, Bret. Please keep getting truth out there to counter the lies of the left wing communists that have invaded our country. / []
The government had the money to upgrade the system. / []
Elon retired from service. Trump hires a new one. Elon has already set the mold for our government in saving money. I would never ever let DOGE go. Oh no no no. / []
Thank you president trump thats why i voted for you. / []
If they are going to help SSI they should get the people to answer the phone in a shorter time , I have had to call 4 times since Jan 25 for a problem and I had to wait at a minimum 2 hours just to get someone 😮😮😮 this is ridiculous and when I leave a call back number they never callback 😮😮😮 / []
One Trillion at a time. We will pay off a lot of America debts. / []
Thank you guys for your service! ❤ / []
What a friking 🗑  waste. / []

Let’s gooo. Thank you to all the individuals on the platform doing this for America. We also do truth truth we need free, energy, free food, plethora paradise let’s go boys let’s fight this realm again healing energy turned to 5G towers into healing benefit show / []
Time to renew all the computers and bring it all up to date. We see what you’re doing Elon and team. Keep up the good work. Thank you for what you are doing / []
They are here for their tax breaks and to rob the american taxpayers pockets / []
Go get'em DOGE! / []
Ask Elon, how much pays for his SpaceX program? And how much government paid for his EV - Tesla rebate? and how much not only the US government and other world governments (Norway, Canada etc) paid for his EV market share capture under taxpayer funded rebate programs. Irony is that Elon is the biggest corporate welfare recipient of the US government. / []
Give me my money check guberment / []
Good Jon.., Elon Musk & the rest of DOGE TEAMS…❤❤❤ God Bless America ❤❤❤ / []
Doge-Dux-Duce. / []
well done / []
Great work. Looking forward to that $5,000 check this summer. I'm broke / []
thumnale super misleading / []
So wheres this money going? / []
The left's mass media arm is spewing lies about Elon, he said it himself; They're going to clean up the Govt. without touching critical functions. Elon will go down in American history as true hero. / []
Thanks for having this interview ❤ / []
I am so happy to see this. It is a miracle. / []
Fraudsters, are also doing this with unemployment benefits ..Thank you !🙏🕊❤️ / []
Elon and Doge team, what can we offer to get your guys to help our country as well? / []
I really think accessing the government websites should only be accessed Mon-Fri no government holidays this would help keep the systems current with real time security systems. / []
I stand behind DOGE and what they are working towards! / []
Ok Fine, I’ll buy my 3rd Tesla. Go Elon!! 👍😎 / []
Thank you but the fact is we need a balanced budget and start paying down the national debt like we almost was able to in the late 1990s it couldn't hurt to put the same people who worked on that then to put them to work now for example Newt Gingrich and maybe Bill Clinton or al gore / []
Ok Fox thanks for getting information from the main source Elon , and DOGE staff, no lies here… / []
Myassumption is that this could be done down at states level one fed level is done. / []
Absolutely incredible work. You are an absolute inspiration to the rest of the world. Any American against this needs their head examining. When are Americans going to realise that the media is absolutely corrupt and lying to them. Are they that stupid they can't see it. Wake up. If you're not on board with this, you are brainwashed and delusional / []
This seems like nothing short of a MIRACLE. ❤ / []
and we not baling the banks again like in 2008 / []
we dont want a bernie madowff / []
i remember to not have health insurecance there was obama care si if you did not have you got a fine / []

MAGA / []
I wish everyone could watch this / []
demicratscan attack the republican electted all they want but 90 % of america loves trump and mus and rubio / []
God bless you Mr. Musk. I am praying every day for you and for your family. I am praying for President Trump and First Lady Melania and all their  family every day. / []
Absolutely love this. Thank you Elon and the rest of the crew trying to fix our system / []
All over the world, this Doge implementation is probigated as bad. You must have a evil corrupt fraudulent mind to not  see that these people are trying to do good for America. Does Elon get paid? No! Instead, he is losing millions on his stock prices. Why would he do this? Can you people not be thankfull. Why would you want to see the bad in this if their are none. So many Americans see this as bad. Why?!!! Because they like being dishonest worshiping what is not good. / []
Wickedness is so real. Psalm 46:1 God is our refuge and strength. A very present help in trouble. / []
Scum. / []
elon dont need any money so he knows with all the money that us waste for companies like us aid that they did nothing and they were making billions all that money could go to america / []
BRAVO👏🏻 Mr. MUSK and  this Superior DOGE Team....     Phenomenal Financial Rescue of our US🇺🇲 Citizens and Reformative Government Agencies.....  SAVE💸.. Transparency... SUCCESS.....  ✌🏻👸🏻❣️ / []
Just don’t understand how people are furious about the cuts and savings but are not furious about living paycheck to paycheck along with the loads of trillions that our country is in with debt… talking this will affect 5-10 gens to comes and also will affect having freedom in the near future if not turned around immediately. People are so brainwashed wow 😢 / ['Many are furious the cuts and savings are not initiated by their own party, so they chose to hate the project and everyone involved, tofeel a bit better with themselves']
I don't want talk. I want proof, specific individuals held accountable and mentioned by name. Congressman/Woman. Republican or Democrat. I don't give a dam just tell us who and hold them accountable. Generations of waste on both sides of the Isle giving away billions to their own states.  Favors and deals with tax payer dollars. Pharmaceutical companies, GM, Ford, Chrysler, Governors are the biggest TAX payer dollar beneficiaries. No application or illegibility we are forced to do. They just take our money and use it as if were their own bank account. Dam thieves, And stay the hell away from my Social Security. 43 yrs or work, it's not a benefit. I, and millions are owed that money. . . / []
❤❤❤keep going doge / []
TAX THE RICH / []
Elon we did nothing wrong!  We just shut down food support for thousands if not millions of starving children.   They just stopped vaccines and mosquito netting causing unneeded disease again for thousands if not millions.    How about the thousands of government employees with great reviews doing great things for American citizens that you fired.    How about the crops farmers depended on selling to USAid to be used to feed starving people that those farmers will not get to sell.   Approximately one third of all government employees are veterans every time you fire 100,000 government employees you are firing 33,333.    You may have successfully more veterans than a lot of enemies did. / ['Elon Musk is so good at even gaslighting himself.   He tells himself he is nothing but virtue when he is actually nothing but evil.']
The love of money is the root of all evil.....beware of the stutterers tongue. / ["all people love money to a degree, it's needed for survival. All people are borned with a certain greed, it's a needed instinct for survival, wanna funnel money/resources going your way in order to secure yourself and your family. All people are not evil."]
God bless Elon Musk and DOGE! / []
These guys are all so smug when they pretty clearly know nothing and are are doing massively destructive things. / []
The only reason liberals hate Elon is because he's working with Trump.  If he were doing the exact same job under Biden, they would be praising him for eliminating waste. / ['Exactly']
These guys are all so smug when they pretty clearly know nothing and are are doing massively destructive things. / []
By every single measure, the US is bankrupt.  I hope this works, but they need to be careful and if there is carpet bagging going on, it will cost Republicans in two years. / []
There are specific reason why data is not shared but that said there are many ways to verify information. / []
I'll like to personally thank these gentleman for everything they are doing for us  America appreciate it / []
This is probably the first interesting thing that has ever happened in Washington. Horrifying I've done. Disgusting, yes. Preposterously ridiculous, sure. All of it repeatedly, all my life. But never interesting. Everyone should be supporting this just on the novelty value alone. / []
There might be more credit cards than people.   A single person might have purchase cards for multiple projects with totally separate budgets. / []
liars, / []
Bigod I fricking love you Elon. YOU'RE GILTY OF SAVING AMERICA. / []
The payment details do not need to be on the Treasury Check they are in a sub chart of accounts at the agency.    These guys are all so stupid. / []
6:06 / []
Does anybody actually listen to what these people are saying? LOL, "since there's a non-zero chance of success, it was worth doing".... HUH?!? LOL, basically if there's a 0.1% chance of success it's worth crashing the economy..... / []
Elon one of America's heros / []
As Asian clearly not my business. But it don't make sense to me why Americans call him a bad guy & thinks Trump is a nightmare for America. Don't they have common sense ? / []
This person talking about paper records being bad does not know what they are talking about.    Those records need to be available for at least 100 years if not 150 years. / []
They steal data, and implement the control grid. Poor us. / []
The glittering caves of retirement AND THEY CALL IT A MINE! / []
I admire Elon Musk’s patience in answering the same question multiple times. / []
California DVM runs on dos. Unbelievable. / []
This is really hilarious since when does the government give us any type of information on where they're spending the money they take away from our taxes They never do this They don't care so in what way anything that these men are saying is true we wouldn't even know because the government never allows the public to know where their tax money goes so this is dumb anything it sounds to me like they're just trying to make a distraction to collapse the economy / []
As a retired federal employee, I know what you are talking about. On my first day at a federal medical facility for prisoners, as a RN, I felt like I walked into a museum when I saw the equipment. This is so necessary! Thank you, DOGE! / ['So while being retired you now agree that people get fired? What a fcking hypocrite']
Thank you for all the patriots ❤❤❤❤ / []
The propaganda is atrocious 💔💔💔 praying for you Elon 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 / []
I am absolutely sure the NPS did not pay a billion dollars for one on-line survey.   100% sure that is a lie. / []
Best and easiest way to get the deficit to zero is have rich people pay there fair share. / []
US GOVERNMENT is getting take over right in your face in a modern style and nothing can the American people do about it. Because, they are too busy with petty racial segregation. / []
What an admirable, selfless group of people! True Patriots. What Elon said at the last with such conviction is inspiring, how anyone can doubt his altruistic motives is a baffling mystery. Personally he and the rest of his team have nothing to gain and everything to lose, yet they're determined to help us. Elon and all of them are real heroes! / []
Thank you Elon and your team for all you are doing for everybody especially social security and other fraudulent money. Thank you. God Bless you all. ♥️🙏✝️💕 / []
Fabulous interview. Keep it up / []
Thank you for this interview ❤❤❤ / []
Gotta tell some truths in order to get people to believe a BIG lie / []
Bro foxs .bro elon musk u look like the Russian doctor in tarzana on amigo and ventura ..persian shits / []
Why the left is against this is BAFFLING. these all sound like common sense moves and their burning Teslas over this?? Unbelievable / []

This is disgusting / []
Zucky blocking this so people don't find out the truth.  ITS THE MAINSTREET MEDIA AND FOX💥💥💥💥💥 / []
Hats off to Elon and the entire DOGE Team, thank you all 🙏🙏🙏 / []
elon musk - thank you ! good to see and hear the team   all talented good men   anyone against this is part of the problem / []
BILLIONAIRES ARE PARASITES!........they steal your money, including Elon Musk. The American people are rising up and fighting back!!!!💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸💪🇺🇸 Trump es un idiota, mentiroso y criminal..........Трампa — идиот, лжец и преступник. / []
You know the people who oppose this are the beneficial factors / []
Elon Musk and the Trump Administration do the absolut right thing ! We love ya from germany ! And our most wish is to have a government like the US with Trump and his team!!!!!! / []
❤ / []
All I can say is "Wow!" / []
If you are against Elon and DOGE you aren’t a true American. This man and what he’s doing is a complete value to the US economy and if you hurt him you hurt all of America.  Deport the haters. They are truly terrorists. / []
Democrats will pull the USA  into a third world country， MASK and Trump have sacrificed a lot of their own money for the USA to return to prosperity. The Democratic Party of the  USA sacrificed the USA for its own interests. Americans are not united. If they unite, the slogan will be realized. / []
DOGE team are heroes ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Thanks DOGE team / []
FINALLY for Gods sake!!!🙏🏽 / []
From the bottom of my heart gentlemen I am a simple laborer nearing retirement with a huge Italian family and all I kept telling my kids is that by the time you're my age America won't be here anymore praise the Lord for a reprieve praise the Lord the election turned out the way it should have praise the Lord for everybody at that Doge team I am praying for you guys as often as I can remember in the meantime it's Sunday afternoon and I'm at a stranger's house working and frankly I don't feel too bad about it now that I know our money is being spent better but I am looking forward to that rebate that elan was talking about that will allow me to actually have a week off which I haven't had since 2021 God bless you and keep you with the love of Christ, D.R. LASTELLA ✝️🙏🔥🤟 / []
Thanks for standing up / []
Elon! Thank you... You're reward will be great there are some of us that truly love what you are doing and love you guys for caring enough about this country / []
The incentive for them is they are getting paid by American taxpayers / []
Hated his first questions. / []
Where’s the pimple faced 19 year olds AOC said were running doge? / []
Keep up the good work! I bet Hillary has to wear a diaper these days! / []
lol if this is true take it to court. Why is it that the people who are so suspicious of the government now believe everything the government says. / []
The WORLD needs to see this👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Blessings on these men doing this work  🙏🏻🌎🙏🏻❤️🤍💙💓 Happy to hear you are going after the haters and lie spreaders 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 / []
Everyone should have the freedom to decide who or what to place their trust in—no one should ever feel pressured to rely solely on the Good Lord. / []
Lier lier teslas on fire / []
Love this come together as 1ONE / []
This is a must. Or bust! / []
I’m going to celebrate them saving us a trillion dollars by buying a new Tesla- it’s the least I can do too thank Elon. / []
I think there should be an Executive Order that every member of Congress watch this interview. A further EO: every Representative and Senator should ask their constituents to watch this. / []
You go Doge. 👍  Check on the welfare check going to people crossing the border to pick them up also. / []
Supporting Ukraine so they can bring this war to an end IS supporting America. Supporting communist Russia is not supporting America. / []
Thank you, DOGE. / []
Where's the gold / []
All white men. But this is America. / []
Thank you, thank you!!!!! God bless you all and God bless 🇺🇸 America!!! / []
THANK YOU!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
I liked that "I used to be a rocket scientist bit"  Excellently delivered interview. Compliments / []
I have had my bank and different credit cards hacked. Also, my Walmart account. In 2021, my identity was stolen.   During his research, Mike Benz saw the records for university government related expenditures disappear.   I understand the logic of digitizing records. What is your backup plan? / []
Thank you Fox News, Great Job! / []
Why didn't Musk  testify in front of congress ???? why weren't democrats in included in theses investigations so called findings ? could it be for more  tax breaks for Billionaires  HAHA / []
Everyone should watch this!! / []
The WORLD needs to see this👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Blessings on these men doing this work  🙏🏻🌎🙏🏻❤️🤍💙💓 / []
Thank you Elon Musk, President Trump, and everyone involved with their team. Much love from Canada. I can only hope we do something similar soon. / []
Lmfao all the people who voted for Trump that lost they jobs 😢 / []
Are those children using drugs ❤😂? / []
Finally the dems are getting their dues🎉 / []
The goal of  Elon/Doge is not to save money. Is to digitalize the government and sell the software to the government. / []
Only fraudsters and criminals are upset with DOGE and the morons with TDS. / []
A French here. Driving a Tesla in France in 2025? Might as well slap a ‘Certified Douchebag’ sticker on the door.   Tu veux que je t’en fasse une version avec un ton encore plus provoc ou une autre vibe ? / []
Democrats are liars / []
Federal employees are so lazy / []
This needs to be required viewing for every American. / []
DOGE should be a Civic and Economic’s class in the schools. / []
The reason the governments computer systems are old is due to the fact DOJ sued Microsoft and when Microsoft became the leading software the gov. did not want egg on their face by utilizing it.   The other reason is because Obama stopped the advancement publicly of improving the computer systems in government purposely making them archaic.  I know because I worked for DOJ during this time. / []
God bless each of you at DOGE! You ARE appreciated by those who truly love the USA! 🇺🇸 / []
I am sure large tech companies like IBM would like to have the the opportunity to help in anyway possible. The corporate write off to help donate some tech equipment and component equipment in this huge task. / []
Thank you DOGE TEAM. God Bless you all / []
No lip service or vague virtue signaling.   Just numbers and information.  How refreshing. / []
Musk needs to fix the Federal Reserve. About 2 years ago, there was a Senate review with the administration of the Federal Reserve; they wanted to know why there was $17 TRILLION dollars missing. She didn't know she said it wasn't her job. / []
Only 150K have watched this on YouTube / []

American citizens thank you gentlemen and keep up the good work! GO USA!!! / []
Also, when will you cut off aid to Ukraine and Israel? / []
I have 30 years in large data warehouses specializing in taking multiple databases not talking to each other into a SVOT SINGLE VERSION OF THE TRUTH linear scalable database (Teradata) and have made fortune 100 companies billions and savings in waste of billions.  Glad to see the federal government letting the best in the private sector fixing these wasteful and fraudulent governments systems / []
Thank you gentlemen!!! / []
I don't agree with all the politics of Trump but I do agree that he is doing it for the right reason. DOGE is doing what needs to be done to save the country from bankruptcy and it needs to be done fast or it will be too late to change anything.   It is possible to disagree with Elon's methods but it is not possible to dismiss his conviction and integrity in regards to the job he is doing for the country.   I was convince of is sincerity when he said in a different interview; " give me money, give me power, I don't care ". Simple words with great significance ! / []
And all the things you have published have been fact checked as false / []
Whats unconstitutional is the amount of money the deep state fools stole and wasted of  OUR  money . Those people are diabolical. And they're being watched by God . / ["They're gonna reap what they sowed."]
Greg I just don't trust this man / []
Everyone needs to see this news interview ❤❤❤ / []
There have been serious mistakes  they are  telling the truth / []
So just get rid of the survey and 1 billion was saved? / []
Wow, I you think about it, some of this stuff has been going on for a long time.  It's probably about the same as our national debt. Think about that!! / []
There must be a report  That is a lie there is np report to congress / []
I blame it on China they're the ones stockpile on gold How do you know if they're not hacking into our social security And I don't understand how China got so big and powerful get to be bigger than the United States / []
😮😮😊 You know there was a comment that we may get $5000 but the amount of waste there is here we have enough for $1 million for every legal USA adult citizen in the United States. That’s about 220, million people. 😢 / []
I know a woman that already started getting more SSI payments. This after the old administration sending a piece of mail to her stating she owed them so they cut her payments by a 3rd. She recently received a piece of mail stating SSI owes her… So they gave her the original payment amount, plus an amount I’m not going to disclose. How exactly does that NOT help the taxpayers? But I believe everything from both sides is a horse and pony show. We could literally give all the power to the people and their states. We literally don’t NEED federal government. Just my opinion / []
It "SHOULDN'T" take a rocket scientist, but nobody else was handling it. / []
Elon, focus on Congress passing repeat last minute large spending bills since that is the gaping hole in the Titanic causing interest rates to rise while our Nation sinks further in debt. Good job with USAID and more. / []
Mark Kelly is going against the government of the United States by visiting Ukraine and getting involved in military operations / []
Outstanding analysis. Should be showing on every network in America 🇺🇸 / []
Professor X and the A team! / []
The MINE, last I heard (2 weeks ago), employed 1,000 workers still using Windows 95 program and FLOPPY discs. So 1,000 people only process 8,000 applications a month? / []
Im not american and obviosly i dont live there , but from the bottom of my heart thank you Doge team for ur patriotic job / []
Elon Musk and DOGE: you are doing commendable job for the American people or government! I am proud of your commitment to do what is right and just!!! God bless your efforts.      jtsdrd / []
People need to watch this (especially older folks so they aren’t fear mongering about social security) benefits will get better with doge / []
You mean Democrats lied?! I am shocked.....not. / []
💕 Elon / []
For at least 70 years our DO NOTHING, CORRUPT govt is OVER, FFFF time!!!!!! LOVE DOGE!!!!! / []
Undamnbelieveable / []
This should be shown everywhere. / ['I agree, but the other "News"(if you can call them News) channels don\'t want the truth.']
They sure seem to harp on "computer systems not talking to each other". I find that really hard to believe, since TCP/IP has been around since 1969. / []
The people everyone wanted to know. / []
Remember how the data is digitised - by human fingers and scans. When I retired I discovered I did not exist, so what happened to all my contributions over 50 years? Asking the DWP it transpired that my NI number belonged to a woman in South Wales. Fortunately I have all my records on file on paper and my pension was reinstated but only after I wrote to the prime minister of the day. I wonder what the outcome would have been if all this data was stored digitally? / []
Thank you Elon for your service / []
If anyone think these tools are here to help are completely brainwashed / []
The Democrats prey on the mentally ill because they're the ones doing this / []
Excellent interview. / []
His intention is to cut the spending regardless of how it's being spent / []
ONLY IDIOTS AND FOOLS are against DOGE!!!!! KEEP GOING!!!!!!! / []
AWESOME 👏 THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS INFORMATION INTERVIEW 😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 THANK YOU DODG ❤✝️ / []
Best interview in our modern history. The screaming Dems are criminals!!!!!! FULL SPEED DODGE, we voted for CHANGE!!!!! / []
Everyone that is saying good job, doesn't work for the government as a employee or a contractor.  They are creating unemployment, Laying off folks with no notice.  People show up to work, can't login it.  Yes they are succeeding at creating unemployment.  And I voted for Trump, but this part I don't agree with. / []
God bless you, Elon. we need you and Thankyou / []
Trump needs to squeeze the MSM when they go after the thieves and fraudsters. / []
Thank you for this incredible interview!!! / []
Smart guy! / []

The X Men are saving the world. / []
Amazing! / []
If you're disturbed over implementing government efficiency and accountability then you're part of the problem not the solution. / []
With a billion dollars I could cure a disease and you could tell me which one. / []
Musk's DOGE Tean seems VERY credible! Imagine all the unqualified, incompetent politicians, bureacrats and thieves who have wasted, stolen trillions of $ of taxpayer funds over the last 100 yrs! / []
I had a dream a few years ago, that I went to the bank to take out money (it seemed like Saudi Arabia's 15-minute "The Line" city, pretty, new, a little like Europe), And I had my Mom's bank card (who is a retiree), and her card had Elon Musk's name on it. And in the dream, I went inside the bank to take out money (I suppose), and I set the card on the counter, and the card started flashing red, like a bomb. So, I became scared about the card bomb, and I left it on the counter and ran out of the building as fast as I could.. and within seconds after I exited the building, it blew up. And then I looked up into the sky, and I saw a huge dragon, which was in space, and visible from the ground, appearing to enter into Earth's outer atmosphere. The Dragon was moving like a Serpent, and I knew that the Dragon must have been GIGANTIC! (maybe 100 miles long?) And as the serpent was coming down into the Earth's atmosphere... it *Stopped*. The Dragon appeared to freeze. Then the dream ended.   And I think that the Dragon freezing (stop moving) on it's way down meant that God has full control over everything that is happening. And that nothing is happening unless everything is in order. The Devil cannot make things happen, but God is in control. And we are close to the end.  We all need to submit to God in every way that He has asked and called us to do. And do our Father's work.  God bless you all, / []
And that’s how the democrats give money to themselves and family members. It is a joke that normal people should understand not people who do things like vote democrat out of spite or due to trump derangement syndrome. But they are so dumb that they believe anything the Dems tell them especially if it is negative because they hate life and want misery. / []
And other places (like my former agency the BLM) are massively UNDER staffed--usually because of the bonkers HR processes the gov uses!  (Me, I happily took the deferred resignation offer DOGE gave us back end of January. I'll go find something else to do for a career :D) / []
How can anyone be against this???  He’s trying to help!!! / []
Anyone skeptical of corporate billionaires’ interest in government efficiency, need only consider that the less tax money the government wastes, the fewer taxes it will require of them, the more real government contracts will be available to them, the more funding and fewer taxes that will be available for their workers which will in turn require less from their companies. The corporate benefits of a government that is less wasteful and more efficient is huge and it’s not only good for them, it’s good for the rest of us. Who wants to see their taxes raised or their company’s taxes raised while the government is wasting hundreds of billions of dollars? That’s what these billionaires interest is. They stand to save themselves and the rest of us far more money than they could take. / []
‼️ Cents & Sensibility  ... Checks & Balances ... My Money Does Matter 💯 ... I do believe in Budgets and Audits  ...  I demand to know how my Tax Dollars are being spent ‼️ / []

Elon and Doge and Mr.Präsident Donald Trump are the Best😊🎉 / []
No wonder why democrats don’t want the government cleaned up. They won’t get anymore money from the tax payers / []
Anyone who is against these 8 people is a mental illness or an enemy of the US! / []
Elon is working hard for USA. It's just wow / []
God bless these guys that’s all I can say!!!!! / []
The Lord keep you  & bless you, Amir! / []
The "Dems must be trying to hide something" comments are getting a little 1930s Germany in here..... / []
Is there one liberal in the audience that this interview helped change their opinion of what the goals are for doge america? / []
I love this man❤❤❤❤ / []
And don’t forget…. Democrats are trying to stop this.   Tells you everything you need to know about them. / []
Trying to make whole process Online and Transparent to Most possible extend  . Deleting Everything and then Hiring can be A Thing  . Having Hiring Experience,talent and other Factor Ways / []
Incredible…….   This is needed and the sad part was that it was needed! / []
I was trying to make a point as Billionaires and Millionaries play with Loans find ways to avoid loans negotiate so why are we giving an honest possibility to the Government. . I mean as a Nation We can also find ways to deal with total Loan Amount / []
In 20 years from now, there will be a DOGE movie based on true events. Clips form this interview will be shown at the end during the credits. / []
You guys are superstars!!  thank you for your service.  I'll try to spread this clip widely. / []
Amazing Dodge team!.  God protects them from evil.  Elon muck is a great person.  Not everybody takes that kind of attack from Americans just to find out and expose things that were corrupted in previous government. / []
We need to track every single penny and where these go and guaranteed they’re trickling into someone’s account that’s supposed to this whole investigation / []
It seems like the Democrats are still trying to hide something with what they just said on this video / []
"BART!!!" ELON MUSK.  A holistic federal wasteful spending assassin. / []
The American people have known about corruption in government for many many years, finally SOMETHING is being done . / []
Fantastic interview! 🤯 / []
Incredible…….   This is needed and the sad part was that it was needed! / []
Elon❤? / []
Pennsylvania is a broken state.  They have taxed us into poverty.  What can the citizens do to facilitate a DOGE audit at the State level?!?!? / []
"you're one of several billionaires here" tells you all you need to know and you suckers are falling for it / []
The thanks that Musk gets is setting fires to Tesla's. God help us 🙏 / []
As an outsider I can tell you there's a lot of countries that wish they had a Trump and Elon / ['Many countries only have businessmen who pursue their own interests.', 'No', 'named one clown.']
I agree with DOGE. Great job. Keep up. Thanks President Trump. / []
Elon Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, have received at least $38 billion in government contracts, loans, subsidies, and tax credits over the past two decades, according to a Washington Post analysis. / []
Trump, the hell boss / []
No bts here. Just talking heads. / []
not surprised that so many  fox viewers in the comments are duped by this illegal immigrant. / []
The interviewer did a great job. He made the interview very interesting and informative. / []
Fox News The advertising channel for the right wing scum and drug consuming Elon who has been abandoned by all good spirits. The USA is pitied by the world for having such stupid leaders who will lead the USA even further into ruin. You are all finished... / []
Musk needs to be locked up / []
None of what DOGE does should be "behind the scenes" but Trump made sure to seal the DOGE records until 2034 / []
I would have liked to see more diversity on this panel women, people of color, etc. / []
What they are doing is illegal and not allowed by the constitution.  Congress , has the power of the purse. Elon should be in jail and orange mussolini too. F.O. All you NotCs / []
Excellent answers to all the questions! / []
Gentlemen, thank you for what you are doing! / []
But how does of this this benefit the people? Are we gonna get a check back for having our tax money wasted? What's the benefit to all these cuts? For the average person, I mean? / []
Why do all these guys make the same shape with their hands? This triangle shape. / []
Is wish all  of you 💯 %  Succes You are doing  great Job  For the hole Americans  people's  Why are you anger  on this  Team  DOGE  ? This Team  is not steeling you But you  and  yourself  Did it So be Glad all off you that someone had the courage  to  do this work for America  Good  from the P Precident Trump  allowed  Elone  Musk to started with Information about  all the Money that disappeared   Succes  Elone.Musk  Still going strong   With  God's  Blessing's / []
Is Musk even smart? I have him as a 4th place finisher. / []
Bravo Elon & Team!!! / []
Thank you fox news ❤ / []
🎉❤God bless this administration and Elon's gigantic heart!!! ❤️💜❤🎉😊 / []
he is cutting billions of dollars in research to big hospitals who are doing research. John Hopkins is one of those and he is destroying the research over there. All the research scientist will be hired by China or other country and US will save a billion now but will loose trillions in coming years. The loss will be irrepairable. Short sightedness and throwing big numbers is what he is doing... / []
Musk make yourself useful and dissolve the IRS.  Free the MarketPlace / []
these guys show their efforts but the pentagon cant show their audits? :💀 💀 / []
Wow, all those teenagers in Elon’s inner circle haven’t aged well. 🤣 / []
Why are not these  Musk team statements fact checked??!!  Why not have an actual Social security manager on your show??!! / []
Schönes Video danke für die ganzen authentischen Videos. Was für eine schöne Insel! / []
Thank you Elon! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👏👏👏 / ['He not even US Citizen', '@ Let’s say he is not a citizen, but he cares! Not like the other corrupt politician, who’s a citizen in this country. ✌️']
it should be a serious economist even a sistem analise to see the impact of this move to take 1 trillion out of the economy / []
Glad I watched this. Very informative. / []
1 trilion out of the economy  is gonna be a massive recession / []
It seems you are " The Magnificent Seven". / []
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 / []
🎉❤ Thank God 🙏 for these gentlemen!🎉❤😊 / []
1 trilion out of the economy  is gonna be a massive recession / []
Best interview EVER funny how ABC Nightly News “the most watched the most trusted in America, do not report these findings but do report on Tesla protests. What a bunch of uneducated reporters! In the meantime Elon please examine the journalism schools not onlyare the expensive and don’t let the students figure anything of substance to report. / []
I have to disagree to an extent with the claim that EVs are vehicles for liberals.  Here in southern Oregon, there are a lot of Republicans and Libertarians driving EVs of all manufacturers. I have no idea of percentages, just noting the people I know. BTW, I am not associated with any political party (yes, I vote) and tend to be left-leaning centrist. This isn't a political comment, just an observation. / []
Its funny that Elon can show up for this sit down but, refused to show up for important committee hearings to discuss the importance of our democracy.   Democratic Representative John Larson once stated,  "Where’s the independence of the committee?” Larson yelled at House Republicans. “Where’s the legislature? We’re an equal branch of government.”  Musk did not attend the meeting, which infuriated Larson.  “Where’s Elon Musk?” he asked, pointing to Musk’s empty seat. “I’m sure he’s a genius and is a very credible person because of the wealth he’s accumulated. But that does not put him above the law, or the responsibility to come before this committee and this Congress.”  I totally agree. / []
Thank You, Mr President Trump, Elon Musk, ... DOGE team. / []
This is 50 years overdue / []
It is outstanding that everyone just takes Elons word as fact. Literally everything he claims has yet to be proven at all. / []
I showed this to my Left-leaning friends, and throughout the whole thing they just kept saying _'Yeah, well he's lying about that.'_   ...Like when someone has such a sour opinion of someone where they just outright dismiss anything they say, how can they be reconciled with, how can we agree that something is a fact or not? / []
This is what government should look like helping the American people instead of stealing from the American people.  Thank you Gentlemen / ['All talk atm', "But not under oath so government doesn't lie to you?", 'do you care at all that they fired thousands of national park employees, dept. of education employees, teachers, and staff to MAKE these budget cuts? american people’s jobs cut just so they can report these numbers? or is that different for you', "\u200b@theobservarator6424It's not necessary since they're on a show genius 🙄", "@memesbyme710 \nExactly. \nIt's just government narrative unfiltered."]
Elon Musk and his team do not give a very convincing performances in what they are doing.  I honestly don't believe they have any ideas in what they are doing 🤷. / []
Maybe defund israel / ['Good idea we should maybe keep the money to our own and maybe get free healtcare with it', 'Great idea jerry']
Why are people on the left who are not in government fighting so hard against this? / []
Liars / []
Only DOGE ( ELON & TEAM ) can do this. / []
Liberals don’t realize they are fighting against their own interests. / []
"I take great offense at those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it." ~ Elon Musk AMEN AMEN AMEN / []
They said the team is a handful of 19 year old nerds. But you are telling me it’s actually run by some of the smartest and successful people in the country? So the news has just been lying like usual. / []
Excellent efforts, Elon! 🇺🇲👊 / []
I totally agree with Elon Musk and Donald Trump Yes 💯💯💯💯 Amen Heavenly Father God Amen / []
Holy crap, burn your teslas, cancel your contracts with star link, they’re updating the system! We’re all gonna die! / []
Why are we not going after the fraudsters? / []
Elon Musk your robots and rockets are considered wasteful and your no good Tesla vehicles. / []
So will Iron mountain be continued for use for national security and military secrets? surely it will still be a huge drain on resources unless it is overhauled itself as a system / []
Much needed and long overdue. / []
I see comments here asking why this isn't shown on national TV and in schools. Then I look at the UK where the politicians want to show "Adolesence" in parliment and schools.. America! You are on the right track! Support these people for christ! / []
Most of ‘goobermint’s’ function is socialistic—providing income for people who that cannot or will not work. Ironically, technology has simply eliminated huge amounts of ‘sweat’ jobs and those jobs no longer provide incomes so survival pushes people toward socialism. To solve this problem, we find ourselves facing basic ‘moral’ realities. Otherwise, there is no lasting solution. ❤ / []
Tyler Hassen! When you’re done with the country would you please come back and fix Houston!!!! / []
This story totally blew me away! The image of Elon Musk walking into that fancy hotel in tattered clothes, only to be judged by Julia and uplifted by Michael, hits deep. It’s wild how a simple act of kindness flipped Michael’s life—engineering degree, Tesla gig, the works—while Julia’s snap judgment cost her big time. I love how Musk uses these experiments to peel back the mask of appearances and test what’s real underneath. For me, it’s kindness that keeps me going, even when life gets rough—what about you? Do you think Musk’s sneaky tests could change how we see strangers every day? ☕🤝 / []
So when is the sum total of all the evidence of these findings going to be publicly available? / []
Stealing are tax money, becoming rich off the American people. / []
Please understand… there are indeed problems in the federal government, but are also people with families that have made a career of serving their nation. I am a DoD teacher. I joined to make a difference and serve military-connected students. This blanket, percentage based, firing hurts real people. It hurts the military, it hurts their children, and it hurts families that support them. As conservatives,  we can still advocate for common sense and compassion as we rework the government. Always remember, these are billionaires that don’t care about people, especially after they’ve already won your vote. They care about their bottom line, from our president to the DOGE team. I may have voted for him, but this is not the process that I voted for. / []
If your good at saving money great but what I don’t like is women’s lives being in danger if they need help for a bad pregnancy or miscarriage, and not all immigrant are evil , they are just like whites some are good some are bad / []
I voted for Trump not Elon musk / []
Brilliant, imagine, common sense! / []
Does anyone know a person over the age of 120 years old. Oh can anyone name a politician who is not a multi-millionaire. Republicans or democrat. / []
Mr Elon musk don't let the mothers drag you down / []
But Tesla stocks! / []
Incredible praise and gratefulness for the work of these men!! 🇺🇸 / []
The Minuteman D-Day Victors now Trump Musk the DOGE Team of a few Patriots / []
I bet you the democrats party is behind Tesla vandalism trying to plummet his stock / []
Thank you Elon ❤❤❤❤ / []
Thank you , now make past leaders , buisness , etc pay back what the owe , out of their own money , not tax money / []
Always treat everyone like people ,not dirt / []
Please send DOGE to Chicago to review “Sidewalk Inspectors” then to Hawaii to investigate the $14 Billion spent on 17.59 miles of above ground metro rail.  No more Federal dollars for these egregious schemes.  Perhaps CALTRANS “high speed” railway as well.  The only high speed feature of that project is fleecing of taxpayers dollars. / []
America's south African savior / []
The liberal media will not show this on their platforms. This will tell any reasonable person that their reporting is biased and they support division and incite hate between red and blue voters / []
Go DOGE go! / []
Too many people in companies hacking to steel or corrupt what they want / []
America love you patriots. ❤️ / []
Elected official should deside that not south African / []
Democrat hate you by watching this for sure.. / []
Always speak in person , show id , never use internet for any transactions / []
DOGE is America's only hope for solvency. Without it we will be bankrupt within s few years !!!!! / []
Search and you will find. My hat's off to the DOGE team. Bring it back gentlemen, fix it and make it great. / []
Americans are so stupid they will believe anything even these beta male geeks.......where is the proof who's issuing these contracts ????? How come nobody's has been arrested or questioned ?? No names no proof .......ya I believe you I'm American lmao / []
The amount of criminality in government is shocking , while Im sure some of it is from Republicans , its clear that a VAST MAJORITY IS FROM DEMOCRATS and the numbers are HUGE / []
And they call you, and they DO NOT shut up!!!   They claim they represent "Medicare."  They are LIARS;  they are robo calls.... and they are a nuisance!!! / []
Everyone will be held accountable , tomorrow, for what we do today / []
The amount of criminality in government is shocking , while Im sure some of it is from Republicans , its clear that a VAST MAJORITY IS FROM DEMOCRATS and the numbers are HUGE / []
Whether you are on the left, or the right, there is no reason to be AGAINST this type of work. / ['Sure - if it were true.  But this is mostly lies!  Selling propaganda & lies to the unsuspecting masses, is the only way they can get away with dismantling all the essential benefits & services our government performs!  Trump is infamous for his lies & misleading statements (over 30,000 documented in his first term), spinning stories all for show; denials of any wrongdoing while being indicted for many serious felonies.  He has chosen people with compromised background & acting experience (TV personalities) for many cabinet openings rather than people with integrity or experience.  It is complete corruption, & Musk is on board.  It is hard to find a truthful statement.']
This is true!!!   This is true!!!  We get 100 calls a day on my phone:  Scammers who have your Social Security number,  and they try to solicit "Medical Programs" -- that we  don't want!!! / []
Still don’t understand why anyone, democrats, wouldn’t like this?????  Why????  Cutting the deficit by 1 trillion to help our children/grandchildren is HUGE!!!!! / ['Because the Demonrats are stealing and pocketing taxpayers money.', 'The Demonrats do not care about the people, they are there to benefit themselves, plain and simple, that is why they are so mad and unhinged.']
Iyoh, The media can lie! I take my hat off to their lies, they are so powerful. This organization is for the good of an American tax payer, and no they're not racist or white supremecist. I'm South African by the way, please continue to cut the USAID funding, because countries don't want to be responsible for their own populations / []
Well, i would like to tell Elon Musk and his team how grateful i am they're helping us... / []
DOGE is trying to keep the SOCIAL SECURITY  fund from going BANKRUPT ! 😢 / []
Senator Kelly, there would be no war in Europe if your feckless party stood up to Putin. / []
I know multiple people in my life that got contacted by social security and notified that they were being under paid in their social security checks and received a check for back pay and a new higher monthly amount. They aren’t taking away from normal people. / []
ELON bought the election and then made up an agency and put himself in charge of it unelected amd then starts slashing agencies whos employees are not his to fire. Absolutely illegal, the republican party of lawlessness. Billionaire news fox / []
The crying like my dad frunal / []
Then why do you want the taxpayers , common people pay for someone s debt , we the common did not create , so hold accountable those responsible / []
Tax wealth and stop waste. The tax must come also / []
DOGE is trying to keep the SOCIAL SECURITY  fund from going BANKRUPT ! / []
See people do not KNOW this.....  and they are NOT informed about details... SO as usual, the PUBLIC retaliates!! / []
I am not a fan of Donald Trump. He has shown his character repeatedly. These guys and what they are doing is of service to the country. / []
For a 10 question survey , (on one side of an 8×10 sheet of paper) , the government paid someone nearly a BILLION DOLLARS !!!!! / []
We voted for this. Thank God in Jesus name AmanAman. / []
Send Elon back to South Africa for a bit, we desperately need him! / []
Systems in the government, such as the computer system,  cost so much because the contractors they hire rip them off. / []
I learned a long time ago that Our Government Computer systems Do Not Communicate.. What a disaster..  More People should see this it's so informative.. / []
Looks like it's all about u being spy in future / []
It’s sad ,for three years I’ve been trying to get a sba loan for my company and was denied,but gave kids with no credit history loans or laundered money so that the citizens can’t progress in their life,it’s all control / []
So proud to be an American! Great job DOGE, a true call to duty from people that did not need to take this on. Every American should be very grateful! / []
Thank You Lord for the guidance & the testimony of Your instruments like the DOGE team & Elon.  God bless them🙏😍 / []
How can people complain about this / []
I wish Bret would grow a pair and ask the tough questions like about the errors in DOGE’s savings reports. For example, the $8billion for DHS which turned out to be only $8million. And the savings that were counted 3 times for USAID. / []
Who is "Big Balls"? I want to see Big Balls. / []
Trump Honest????? Give me a break. Made everything Elon said invalid when making a comment like that.  Much proof over 50 years of dishonesty in so many businesses and personal life. It’s well documented long before he ever ran for president so this is NOT a political statement. / []
The democrats Party  are idiots and F**** thieves. stealing from the people they're supposed to help. / []
Why is Elon getting so much hate right now ??!! / ["Because he mocks people when they lose money but cries when others mock him? He calls people the r word? He calls American heroes traitors? He's pulled away regulators? He destroyed jobs for the vets? Not sure where to start. Hey but he's made sure he's killed his competition."]
God bless Elon Musk and his Doge crew 🙏 / []
Clean House, Pull The Plug On The Swamp, it’s crooked government taking care of crooked citizens, and the working man can’t even get a loan for six thousand for a piece of equipment that’s going to make money. / []
This is actually pretty incredible. I'm reminded of the story of the frog and the scorpion. Where the frog initially doesn't want to give the scorpion a ride across the pond for fear of being stung. Then the scorpion reassures the frog that he wouldn't sting the frog because then they would both drown. The frog gives him a ride on his back and the scorpion does in fact end up stinging the frog. They're both about to drown and the frog cries out why would you do this?! We're both going to die now! The scorpion states...because....I'm a scorpion.  There are some that are not concerned about the sinking ship that is our country. As long as they get their cut. If the country goes down, it seems to be fine with many of these career politicians, professional victims, and others that are suckling at the teet; that is, as long as they can take the rest of us down with them. / []
See you in the breadline Elon / []
Thank you, DOGE!  Excellent interview! / []
Wow the left says all these guys are teenagers or fresh out of college they are not aging well 😂 / []
Just because they have found this amount of waste doesn't mean they will use this money for the good of The People, or even stop it! You people in the comments act like their going to cut you a check, when all their doing is telling you this stuff. Why don't they SHOW us what their looking at? Why should we believe a self admitted Ketamine drug user? / []
How can anybody believe this billonaire!? Oligarchy incoming… / []
15 years ago, Elon supported these corrupt, evil people. I am glad he sees the evil, but why didn't he back then? / ["They gave him billions, he's now in a position where he is removing regulators and people that were not keen to fund him anymore."]
We need to control telecom providers too. They sell US phone numbers to call US citizens facilitating spam calls (from overseas countries like India, Pakistan, etc) and charge us if we want to block them. Younger educated people can avoid the scammers but elderly are being impacted the most. This is inhumane to expose your own citizens to this kind of scammers for profit. / []
i  went to office i report my suv... mr. elon needed your help sir.... in il.... / []
I am thankful for everyone in Doge and especially Elon...God Bless You Doge ❤ / []
How do scammers talk social security into changing bank accounts? There are security questions to prove your identity... / ["Have you ever been a victim of ID theft? It's out of control! You have no idea. It's horrific with what one of my friends family has had to go through"]

I am not American and i am impressed.  My single suggestion is dont fight the outside, focus on the inside first.  The race is always against oneself. If your competitor is running real fast, do you win by tearing his shoes or do you make sure that you train harder and use the best gear?    Good luck DOGE and all the best to the US. / []
Why isn’t the known.     People that exploited the. Government piggy bank not locked up ? / []
This sounds amazing but at this point I want to believe change is happening but the gov is such a  dog and pony  show. We need results the people can feel .  Not just hear about / []
Thank you Thank you. This was a full easy to understand interview. I’ve been trying to explain to naysayers. I’m just gonna forward to them. / []
What about veterans benefits??????............People that are destroying Tesla cars should go to jail, "One can not undress a saint to clothe another". / []
This is good  and all. But.  When will we the people see any actual relief ?  Like we. Are forced to pay huge tax bills. While the federal employees and politicians  have. Exploited  us . We need immediate relief / []
Thank you doge team and elon musk god bless you all ☺️🇺🇲❤️ / []
Are the idiots that did this going to be punished that are still working for our Country? / []
You can thank pelosi and her democrats, for those debts. The billions of dollars had to be their idea. , and the fake loans. 😢 / []
If in fact then this is terrifying stuff / []
Thank you Elon, the DOGE team and President Trump! / []
I hear people speak lies about Elon, I’m an American a veteran and I’m a patriot. Elon has my support President Trump and his entire cabinet are true and tried to be for America 🇺🇸 Let’s go after the democrats. Lets bring their actions to the light and expose them as traitors they are💯 / []
I think most people are upset by THE WAY the process of reducing costs is being carried out.  If things were explained, department by department, then the general public would perhaps see this group and MUSK differently.  However, some of Musk's behavior (on TV and at the WH) often leaves a negative impression of this man, and then in turn, TESLA, and in turn DOGE. / ["Well, here they are trying to explain it, and they have been trying to explain it, and they haven't been getting the coverage that they need! It's up to us, there's a population to share stuff like this because the rest of main media won't! That is what people have been screaming."]
I love watching America give absolute buffoons like Elon a stage, and watching him act so poorly. This honestly was the best comedy skit all year. You're a joke America. / []
You can thank P / []
It sounds good but unfortunately we cant trust anything on the news especially Fox news who is pro republican to the point they will lie on democrates. I like everything Im hearing well  I love it. Im a Elon Musk fan he is like me a African American very wise man and with his help all of these things can be done. Im a Trump supporter but I dont trust any politician. People in America are not Americans because they are so divided if they were Americans they would be one. When divided you are weak and fall for anything politicians and any rich person has to say. So lets wait and see what happens. We cant trust anything they say until we see results. / []
The left has legit gone mad / []
Are they still sending text for the Employees to answer their text? / []
Thanks for doing this interview, go Elon! / []
Population crisis! Will the population ever go up 1 billion in one year / []
Dearest Elon and your brilliant team, God Bless you and protect you and all your families. Please do not take personally all those corrupted lunatics. You have to understand that you are exposing them as a great thief’s stealing from the population for a years.  You are cutting the fats that they built up for years. Those, who support those mobs are the one who will face the Judgement that they  can not even imagine what they will face it, and I am not sorry for them. The Universal Law: Cause and Effect. Thank you again. All is well!!! / []
Elon hired corporate goons to put more gov money into his wallet / ["Did you watch the video. Because that's not true. We need more corporate people running our government.

One trillion $$$ equals $1000 billion, it would not be WASTE of the $38 billions that he has received of government contracts??? And wouldn't be $962 billion left over from one trillion dollars that he wants to cut?  Does it make any sense?  Obviously, if he returns that money.   / []

Phenomenal interview. I hope every American watches this! These people are so intelligent and so sincere about saving our country & our citizens from bankruptcy.

First Elon, your method of government waste reduction is ridiculous. First one would do an audit with CPA's and the inspector general's office. This is crazy to fire employees who have shown by evaluation that they are doing a good job. Second to send people an email that they should send 5 things they accomplish is really crazy. If Tesla was a government branch Elon would be fire for losing so much money running his business.  The problem is that DOGE is not precise and most of the money should be cut from the military where Elon is being paid by our government. I must say that if we canceled Elon's contracts there would be a large savings.  Conflict of interest is a great threat and a Billionaire who does not need soc sec , medicare, and medicade.  an honest Elon would give up his contracts and understand that Government IS NOT a Business. / ['GREAT POST! Thanks for your intelligent analysis and input!', "The government does need to be run by  business practice standards.  it needs to be held accountable like businesses are. If businesses ran the way government is, they would all be delisted.  And they have brought people in and are running these audits, if you did not listen to this interview. They are working with the ig departments. And what you are saying is pushing the lies. They aren't doing their own thing ..\n The government can't pass audits and hasn't passed audits, and no one's done anything about it to fix it.... they literally said in this interview, it's  been a lack of caring"]

A whole panel of billionaires?  Yeah, we will trust them…NOT. / ["Why would you not trust a billionaire?That hasn't been thrown in jail..

Would love to know who the government employees are who were caught defrauding the system. Wonder how we could find out who those people are and what penalties they received.  Surprised this question wasn’t put to the DOGE team / []
Every American should watch this interview / []

15:21 "solvency of the USA"?  Is the USA in danger of not being able to pay the retirement benifits for its workers? I didnt know the USA is that broke. 33:40  We all agree, that no car should be burned. However, he really does not know, why there are protests?? Tesla just needs to fire Elon and the protests would stop tomorrow. Its not just propaganda. Its things like supporting the far right in Germany, that upsets alot of people.

What he said at the end about the Ukraine war is so compelling and well stated. / []
The things they are finding are criminal.  So the people involved need to be arrested asap / []
but where is the people that committed these crimes why isn't anyone in jail or court  it make no sense for me to believe these i need to see court cases  paper work not just words  !!! / []
Elon Musk and DOGE team doing a great Job! / []
So who took all that survey money.  People need to be arrested. / ["It's not illegal to accept a contract and payment handed you from a public office.

This is UNBELIEVABLE. As a person who worked in the computer industry back in the 90s I can't imagine having computer systems that were installed during or before that period. What a waste!! What a giant pit of corruption and incompetence!! I hope DOGE and Elon continue their work all through the next 4 years and not just "130 days". / []
This should definitely be aired all over the world. Anyone who sees this and thinks it is not a good thing, should be ashamed to call themselves an American. Anyone with a brain and the ability to love can see this is going to help the people of our country and if you're against it then obviously your for it. Why would you want your children to have to pay back the debt of the handful of people that are benefiting from the billions of dollars they are stealing right out of our pockets!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Seriously, Do you really hate president Trump so much that you would rather see our country go bankrupt just so you don't have to admit he really loves our country 🇺🇸🇺🇸  "I commend all of the "True"  Americans that are helping president Trump drain the swamp"  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 """ GO DOGE """🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []

Population only up 2 percent and the government spending is up 55 percent they better find the waste or guess who the dems  if they get in will get it from the middle class if there are any left or the rich and they know how to avoid paying taxes or will start sending their money offshore or social security recipients will never get a raise, but they will raise when you can collect  social security, let DOGE do their job. I'm with all of you everyone should see this. / []
The collective intelligence of the men in this room are on a completely different level from anything or anyone in the entire Democratic party. / []
Sincerely, for years, I have believed that our leaders / congress  and President(s) - were planning to sink our Nation - selling out to our rivals in order to share power with our rivals as our congress would have privileges granted by those who they sold out to, creating an oppressed America. We would all become involuntary indentured servants , worse than what we are now - at the mercy of this fkn progressive income tax "state" !!! / []
Good point Elon, Although a bloated government IS the "exploited gap". / []
Moving forward - Can we - the American citizen - have a website showing ALL spending? As well, can we see all agencies that run our Nation, including how many employees, materials , equipment etc that is involved in running our Nation? User friendly of course. We want simple laymen language on a website which shows all of our agencies and their purpose as well our money involved / []
Wow.  Powerful words from Elon.  Keep him safe / []
❤ you Elon, Thank You / []
Can the disbursed monies which left the treasury and social security be tracked? / []

Exactly what we’ve needed for over 40+ years, DOGE! / []
So, in line with the transparency claim, the work done will result in a demonstrable debt repayment and nothing beyond that — is that correct? / ['the first goal is to at least stop the big growth in national debt, by reducing governmental costs and a need to take up as much debt as in the passt.']
Maybe if America stopped giving billions of grants to billionaires (like Elon)  and started taxing the rich properly, they won’t go bankrupt. Anyone thinking the rich pay all their taxes are probably on ketamine. / []
Billionaires dont care about yall 🤦🏽‍♂️ / ["These billionares don't have to care so much about the people out there, does not matter how they care.

Fantastic interview! Thanks! / []
Do not embrace this wholeheartedly.  Research this name -  Joshua Norman Halderman. / []
Elon owes Senator Kelly an apology. How is Kelly's visit to Ukraine putting another countries interests ahead of the US? Kelly said the US should support the Ukraine. Trump is putting Russian interests ahead of our own and our allies. Putin started the war, and his military failed to win. The civilian and military deaths, mostly the Russian military, are Putins' fault. / []
People are leaving the government on terms that they can be selected and given 8 months pay while not working, and they are also able to pick up another source of income in the free time that they now have. This was seen as a possible ease into retirement, which any loyal employee who had put in their service would be hesitant to ignore. However, they were also given discretion to be rehired after the 8 month period. Stating that there is voluntary exodus because there is a lack of respect or outdated programs is incorrect. That is not to say the outdated tech is not true. I will say that I am totally for updating practically the entirety of data storage, transferring, and usage. Hurry up and wait is the government slogan. It's a common grievance but it also makes a bit of sense. There is also waste in the government, but there is the same in any entity that deals with monetary exchange and discretion.  It's the machine we run companies through as a capitalistic society.   I look forward to a day where things are more efficient. However, haste creates oversight in security as well. I wish the best for a positive outcome, but I am hesitant in putting my hopes in a government that seems to be becoming more privatized. I hope the money that DOGE secures goes to the public through positive means and services. This is not a battle between the right and left, it's the securing of the American people and their well-being. / []
Yup Revolution is the right word! Its overdue! / []

This wasn't a softball interview. This was a cotton ball interview. I dare these fraudsters to go on CNN or even MSNBC for an actual interview. They will have to actually answer serious questions and not just give unquestioned statements. / []
That is an utterly compelling interview. Quite brilliant. Elon and his DODGE team are freaking heroes. / []
Congress can also take a pay cut and it will only hurt their pride.  No raises. Alot of them own several homes in different areas plus their vacation homes and trips. We get a $5.00 os$10.00 raise. I know they get a whole lot more than that on their raises. They go out to dinner and pay. $500.00, more or less and they don't think twice about it. New car's when they are tired and they go get a newer model of their choice.  Guess what,we are paying for what ever they want. God help us American's. This is another way to help cut the deat instead of buying more stock's. Lord help us.🙏🙏🙏🙏 / ["Hell they are all millionaire's on a government salary and they all need to be investigated big time!!!"]

Again, so many idiots in my state. / []
You guys actually believe this bullcrap? Americans are so gullible. / []
Interesting. All but one are white middle-aged  billionaire men. Musk is a liar and has lost all credibility in my book. He even lies when he says he is an expert video game player. I want independent confirmation of every claim they make. The so-called information on the DOGE site is posted and then deleted, and numbers without clear explanations are posted. If they are being transparent, then allow an indepent group of observes to watch and verify their work. DOGE closing and cutting funding or even controlling spending is unconstitutional. Only Congress approves money for agencies or can close agencies they created, not a bunch of billionaire white men-- the bas..tards. / []
I have to admit I like this kind of transparency. I like what they are doing even though I don't like Donald Trump. / []
No dei on that panel.. thank god / []
How much has Elon wasted in grant money blowing off rockets? / ['The rockets handed money to blow off, have blown off. It they where not blown off, it would been a vaste.']

Good man? Not mean? Aside from the mutliple rapes. / []

You're the evil, Elon / []
As a former lifelong democrat, I am horrified at how completely unhinged and dangerous that party has become. The lies they use to stoke misplaced indignation are shameful. I am grateful to Elon and the gentlemen of DOGE. We are lucky to have them. I hope they continue to do interviews because people need to hear what they are really doing not what the democrats claim they are. / []
Can someone please stop this psychopath whining and bitching non-stop? You're destroying people's lives, Elon  - that's why everyone hates you. Buy a mirror, genius. / ['Fraudsters complains the loudests']

the senator from Oklahoma Dr. Tom Coburn screamed about this stuff for years "the fleecing of america" and nobody listened. / []
Thank you, Elon and DOGE / []
You just need to do your research. The survey for hundreds of millions is rubbish. So is the claim about Stacey Abrams. They are just barefaced liars. But, they also know that MAGA are dumb enough to swallow every lie they tell. Pronounce DOGE properly - "dodgy". / []
Elon and DOGE team - thank you graciously for your hard work and exposing the truth to us the people- I pray we open eyes to those that are blind to these facts you are finding- may God protect and bless you divinely for all your work . WE the PEOPLE love and support you, Frauka in California - and we the people in California are waiting for DOGE to come to California and rate the spending and the taxes and where the tax dollars are going.

Problem is you aren’t finding the numbers you say you are and you’ve let go of federal workers and disrupted services without doing your due diligence.  You have not consulted congress.  Congress makes decisions not the executive branch to make these line item cuts.  Lots of items have had to be removed from the doge list because of errors. / []
If Doge believes they are honest about their cuts then they should release an official report with everything included. Musk already said they're not going to have an official report. So everyone believing this is completely taking him by his word, when facts have already come out that the amounts of their cuts have been wrong and were much lower than they were reporting.    Social Security is the most successful government program and it keeps 18 million seniors out of poverty every year. And if they knew anything they would know that Social Security is not going bankrupt. If the cap on the program isn't lifted by around 2035, the program will pay 83% of benefits. That's not bankrupt.   If Elon wants to cut waste then why not start with himself. He's taking an awful lot of subsidies from our government and he has gained more government contracts since he was appointed not elected and started his unofficial "job".  So it's okay for Musk to receive billions of dollars from tax payers and that should not be cut, but it's just the poor and working class that needs to be cut from.  And conservatives trust him to make these decisions after he revealed his true feelings and called Social Security a ponzi scheme. Is this the guy you want to handle this job? / []
why the host so orange? / []

I don't understand on why USA keeps on giving money to other countries, they should give the money to us co'Z we're the one's who pays taxes here. / ["there are several reason why some money are sent out of the country, like for example can be cheaper helping people in need back in their home country instead of eventually seing them in the USA and feeding them here, and so on and so on. Helping out foregin countries where drugs are manufatured, reducing the amout of drugs finding it's way to the US causing many deaths and costs following.

If their intention is to make Social Security more "efficient", why did Elon Musk claim that it's the biggest thing that needs to be eliminated? Why are they laying off half of the employees, while removing phone service and closing down offices? The only thing that this is going to cause is people who deserve benefits not getting the money, mind you, THAT THEY PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY with the decades of their hard work! / []

Elon is one of the greatest patriots this country has ever seen. He has laid on the wire for this country and placed himself at great peril and financial loss to help this country.

It’s more than just propaganda. I wonder where the funds come from. I wonder what the incentives are for those that are warmongering against Tesla and Elon.   Attorneys can hide wealth better than most people. Attorneys can also agree to help with life changing work without a payment or receipt. Attorneys often help people who are at their lowest point and cannot afford an attorney. Although it is not always attorneys directly involved in the destruction; It may be that some are causing violence indirectly. However I know that there are also amazing attorneys including our US Attorney General. / []

•50% of the U.S. live on 2% of the national wealth. •1% of the U.S. hordes 31% of the nations wealth.  America’s billionaires are now collectively worth a record $6 trillion.

FACTS:  In the third year of Trump's presidency, there were 61,011 Social Security Administration employees.  In the third year of Biden's presidency, there were 56,907 Social Security Administration employees.  Did you notice any differences in services under the Biden administration with 4,104 less employees?  No, you did not.  Musk recommends cutting 7,000 employees along with automating much of the antiquated distribution of benefits.  Trump is just getting rid of the 4,000 employees Biden hired late 2023 to buy their votes. / []

On surface what these guys are doing is great. But what needs to be transparent is — what is the incentive of these very busy millionaires and billionaires helping the country?  That needs to be clear. We should thank the people giving us free food — but also ask — why are you helping me?  If a system could be exploited in theory — it will be exploited in practice — especially in politics. I love my children or I love my country should not be enough. The incentives need to be super clear. Nationalism is for the poor, not the rich. / []

Yet they have 32+ million dollar homes😮😮  along with their family members are well off and what kind of car do they drive and how many cars do they own? How big is their garage??? All this needs to be looked into and when they’re living over there yearly income, and can’t account for where the money came from all of it needs to be sold and put back where it came from and charges of grand theft needs to be charged 😮😮 I know if it was us poor folks that scammed and stole we would be doing time in prison with nothing left to come home to when we got out. it’s like how many bank accounts do they have how many bank accounts overseas how much bundles of money and gold do they have under their mattress?😮😮😮 yes and why Nancy Pelosi what the hell months a lot of them please please look into it and may God bless you. / []

And here I was told by media that DOGE was just a bunch off young 20 yos tech kids, but it's in fact full of experimented CEO and CFO that could carry on making millions in the private sector and could easily abuse the same gvmt they are trying to save.  You don't hate MSM enough / []

This is historic. For decades every administration, rep or dem was part of the problem not addressing the expanding waste and abuse in government, until now. Bravo Trump, Musk, Cabinet and DOGE team. Very ironic that it takes billionaires to attempt to tackle this problem. When past millionaires and their cronies ran the country, they may just be part of the problem skimming off the system and not wanting a fix. Really questioning the intelligence and morals of those opposing this effort. / []
This is not everyone's cup of tea. But it's well worth listening to.  I have no doubt there are similar anomalies here in UK Systems. Maybe not as bad as it is currently in the USA.  I couldn't believe hearing *the same paper based retirement system has been in place for over 70 years* ....    and there are *15 million people flagged as alive who are over 120 years old* ...  I hope our government here in the UK starts doing the same overhaul of our archaic systems and probably saves the government 100s of billions of pounds. The money that could be spent elsewhere. / ['Is that what you think?']
Flood the zone with lies and ,maybe nobody will notice. There have been massive layoffs with fake  performance issues.  It's nonsense that most staff cuts are voluntary. Brett let through so many lies. / []

The National Institute of Health has 27 different Chief Information Officers with computer systems that can not speak to each other, is the way Big Pharma loves to "Divide & Conquer" the medical system.  This helps Big Pharma to make sure Americans stay sick and unhealthy so that more drugs can be prescribed to them.   THANK GOD for DOGE!!!  Keep up the much needed work and I look forward to continuing to help make America Healthy Again! / []
This man has no emotional intelligence. We need to flood twitter with our bank account statements at the end of the month. Average is -30. If there is 10 bucks in there that is a good month. 50 yrs this been going on. We have learned to live in the moment. Kindness love our families. Who love us. Grossest comment, those that complain are frauds. Clueless. His eyes are dead and selfish. / []
Wow just wow! / []
Elon is right about going to meetings in order to retire.  I was a custodian in a public school in Pennsylvania,  he’s exactly right.  I had to go to meetings and it took almost 4 months to get my retirement.  I had to have enough money to live until I received my first retirement check.

Money laundering at its best it’s clever we fell for it. We should not have to pay taxes ever again for this reason. The federal reserve has us by the balls. They make money out of nothing. Again everything on this planet is fake and when you wake up you can see the cleverness of sin in people. Thanks for taking this on musk  I hope there is not another agenda at play and trying to hide something coming down the street. I see all of this getting worse. You need to look into the federal reserve. But they are a clever organize bunch. We should call them “ the untouchables” 🎉 / ['You’ve got the right idea. We can only hope we can stop the fed.']

Now the American people need to ask themselves. Why would Democrats be against this? / ["Because there is a good chance this behavior will end democrats as we know them. It's already happening.  They are a lost puppy right now"]
My perspective is that our national crisis is American poverty. The numbers of homeless people and those living under the national poverty line is unthinkable. Once and for all, the American poverty crisis needs to be addressed by our government as an urgent concern, right here and right now. Next, the enormous Pentagon budget needs to be drastically cut because of it's out of control spending budget with no accountability to the government or the public. / []
Glad the truth is talk amd not sold.. glad they are stoping all that negative stuff in America / []
33:40 IS KEY HERE. This is one of the MAIN issues in America right now. / []

Ukraine is fighting for their independence and freedom. That is far from nothing. So many countries, including mine, was but did not want to be a part of soviet union or russia.

Ok, I am convinced ..when do we see the government debt decrease?  This year, next year?  Will dRumpf just increase spending to yield a net increase?  Tax breaks for the rich seems unnecessary at this point.  Let's decrease the debt down to nothing before dRumpf starts giving it away.  Why the chainsaw if it's surgical?

God bless and protect Elon and his DOGE team. I can’t imagine a rational person not feeling gratitude for the enormous sacrifices they have made, in an effort to save our nation.  As a mother, my biggest worry is what quality of life my kids will have in the not so distant future, as a result of the intentional destruction of our country by the left.  Trump and Elon are on overdrive, congress/senate need to show they are for the people and codify Trump’s orders.  It’s only been 3 months, but they need to get their act together. 🇺🇸 / []

Jessica Tarlov, on the Fox, programme the “The Five”, claimed that, the National Park survey did not cost what Musk’s claimed, also a Republican Senator claimed, that Social Office had been closed because of DOGE. I like to DOGE to directly confront her allegations . Her criticisms seem selective. Also Elizabeth Warren, Maxine Waters and Adan Schiff,  need to either consult DOGE and work with them for the sake of USA.  If not their mis deeds will be found / []

👀👀👀Putin hat eine Geheimdienstoperation angeordnet, um Donald Trump mithilfe von Hackerangriffen, Falschmeldungen und Angriffen auf das US-Wahlsystem zum Präsidenten zu machen. Dass dieser jetzt Selenski droht, kommt also nicht von ungefähr. Als Trump 2025 die Präsidentschaftswahlen gewinnt, unterhält er bereits seit Jahrzehnten Verbindungen zu Geschäftsleuten mit Verbindungen zur Kreml-Elite.  Ein Blick auf die Vergangenheit zeigt eine lange gemeinsame Geschichte von Trump und Russland. Immer wieder halfen ihm russische Oligarchen finanziell aus der Patsche, wie der deutsche TV-Sender ZDF schon vor Jahren berichtete. Und auch der KGB befasst sich schon länger mit dem Immobilienmogul. Redaktion/ Zürich / []

The details matter. It's easy to say you're making positive changes, but they need to be confirmed. Breaking things fast to find the problems isn't how government functions. Musk saying you just put things back is naive. Everyone should understand why the government still functions on paper. Modernizing has been debated over decades. Government could be using floppys or microfish, but paper is still the best archive. Paper doesn't disappear from bad IT. You don't want to completely remove paper, even if the Government is digitized. / []

Fake news and a lot of stuttering. Can’t wait for your downfall Elon. / []
I am a huge fan of government efficiency   However, I find it challenging to trust statements from Musk and his associates due to the prevalent misinformation.  Example using ChatGPT: “  Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), recently claimed that the federal government spent nearly $1 billion on a simple survey that could have been conducted for approximately $10,000. Specifically, he referred to a National Park Service survey, suggesting it was a significant example of government waste.       However, investigations have found no evidence supporting this assertion. CBS News reported that there is no record of the Department of the Interior allocating or planning to allocate such a substantial amount for a survey or any single contract.     This isn’t the first time DOGE’s claims have been scrutinized. In another instance, DOGE reported canceling an $8 billion contract with U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, but further examination revealed the contract’s actual value was only $8 million.     Given these discrepancies, it’s advisable to approach such claims with caution and seek corroborating evidence from multiple reputable sources.” / ['I truly feel these individuals and Elon are truly well intentioned and have no intended malice.', 'Competence is as crucial as intent in these initiatives. By making numerous claims that are significantly inaccurate, they undermine their credibility through baseless assertions.', '@NYX_003 I don’t believe many people oppose the DOGE; rather, they are frustrated with its pattern of making baseless and highly exaggerated claims. For instance, DOGE asserted it saved $8 billion by canceling a contract, which was later revealed to be only $8 million—a significant overstatement that undermines its credibility']

I love this part of Elon. However. It’s almost April, not one arrest or indictment from all of this theft? / []
How about going after DoD? So much waste there! Cut one program and you’d have found your trillion dollar savings / []
I have a question: Was Fox receiving money from USAID?? / []
"Scalpel, not hatchet" I love it. / []
Okay, I stand corrected. Dead people receiving social security is a real head shaker. All because government departments don't communicate. 🙄 / []
Musk and his clown car group is a douchebag. They are cutting to help the billionaire class. Musk is lying and not providing details. / []
Thousands of kids losing their lives  everyday and these people just want it to continue forever...  Elon Musk has contempt for them and he wants them to Know it ...!!   I didn't think this man nor these men existed, it takes a lot of courage to do what they're doing and it seems to me they're doing for the men women and children standing next to them as opposed to lining their pockets. / []
The entire interview is SOOOOO enlightening. But what really put the nail in the coffin for me. An ex-democrat was Stacey Abrams receiving 2 billion dollars for an NGO that didn't exist. Wait ... what? Where was this money going to go? / []
Why not create more savings by reducing tax cuts for the rich as well? / []
Roosevelt once said "We are not building this country of ours for a day. It is to last through the ages." He said that in regards to conserving nature & wildlife but what Doge is doing is perserving the legitimacy of our system. / []
The idea that the scope they are aiming for is 1 trillion in cuts and we have 37 trillion tells you we have a major problem we are putting on future generations, a selfish problem to avoid, spending today to suffer tomorrow. I know one side likes to make big business the enemy but do you trust the people making these accusations?  Do you think Bernie Sanders knows how to responsibly manage your money more than someone in the C Suite?  If you ask me do I want businessmen managing money or politicians, easy one.  Businessmen have to be responsible in the marketplace and to their customers or they die.  Government talkers as exposed here have accountability to no one and they live??  Tell me how that makes sense. / []
Lies...... traitors / []
Great. Thank you. 🇺🇸 / []
His request for an unedited interview with Jon Stewart fell apart. Mr. Musk changed his mind when he found it would be with a live audience. / []

The Congress or the President needs to put pressure on the banking system to find unusual accounts that could be taxpayer money sitting dormant. What if trillions are sitting in accounts that are lost. / []
Good job. Many governments around the world needs their own "DOGE" / []

President Trump and he's team with Elon Musk making the Great Revolution in USA!!! Biggest respect all of them / []
"There are over 15 Million people that are over the age of 120 that are marked as alive in the social security system.... since 2008 at least from an IG report."😲  All that money is being stolen from fraudsters. / []
Thank you Mr. Brett / []
Musk is the most UN-selfaware person I have ever seen. / []
40% of the Social Security phone calls are from faulters.  This does not mean that all of the 40% were successful. They were identified as FAULTERS! / []
If Musk wants to cut the deficit in half, he can give up just one of his contracts. Show us the waste! Proove it! Because we don't believe you! You're a liar! / []
If he is telling the truth.  I will vote for him😊 / []
Thank you to all of you men!! You are great Americans🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Elon Musk is a real life Tony Stark. / []

Amazing interview!! Amazing information.. unreal!! Pisses me off that my tax dollars are being wasted.. Give it back to me!! I will spend it and be able to retire sooner!! 😤😤🤬🤬 / []
Porsche - Fast Ferrari - Faster Tesla - Fascist / []
The man who has become a billionaire with rhe help of governments' supports seeks to dismantle it and hurt others. I can only hope the law of karma teaches him about suffering. / []
I love what they are doing but they are too soft. The goverment waste is theft to the people. Every dollar they spend is a dollar the private sector loses to invest and create new things. The US government used to be only 4% of GDP, now it's at around 45%, so there's 41% of GDP stolen from the citizens and given to politicians. Imagine the growth the country would have if that 41% of GDP was in the hands of the people, you and me, saving and investing. That's 11 TRILLION more in people's hands. Just insane.  They are great, but they are too soft. Scared. Ask Milei what he thinks about softness. / []
Trump backer?: Hey Elon, you're JUST LIKE ERROL. And your mom should send back HER Canadian citizenship card, much less a tinhorn moron (live on Mars, huh peanut brain?) like you. / []
This is one of the most revelate interviews in our time!  Bret will win awards for this interview. / []

Personally I like a paper tray even though it's on digital. People are asked for proof with situations and without it the government usually will use their title to override ppl.  On the other hand, digital is better for saving space. Regardless , communication is the key. QUALITY work and EDUCATED people. (Opinions) / []
Wait, where’s Amy Gleason? 😂😂😂 all lies / []
They don’t talk about the rapes of woman / []
So Musk,  an African who can't be president,  paid for trump's second presidency and now trump has handed this African the keys to our country and authority to fire actual American veterans. Disgusting.  Musk should focus on fixing his nation.. South Africa / []

Isn’t it scary how there’s so much red tape in the government that anyone who tries to change it gets attacked and villainized / []
Some of these offices/divisions were created independently, during other administrations. Obama's, Biden's, and go back  decades. They were said it was to audit or edit dollars spent to stop wasted spending. Now people will need to look for other employment until existing branches of government need quality workers i know it's difficult. Some companies will say you're over qualified… keep trying 👍🏼 / []
"The fundamental weakness of wester civilization is empathy" Elon musk The irony... / []

Remember when the Biden Admin said anything to the American PUBLIC, or posted any budget, or sounded ever intelligent...no...me either.  Good job DOGE😊 / []
I’m all on the same page except for forcing Ukraine to give up their land for peace. If you give a bully what they want, they will come back for more.   It’s not for us to decide what Ukraine is allowed to do to defend itself. Imagine if another country tried to take 20% of the most productive parts of the USA, would we give it up to stop the fighting? / []
I have no interest in the richest man on earth controlling my tax dollars. You think he won't look out for his own financial interests? If you believe he wouldn't, you are delusional. / []

I'm with the efficiency auditing, but who's auditing the accounting of what DOGE is finding so we know that it's counting towards the balance sheet as a save vs just a paper money DOGE puts on their website? / []
When DOGE hits their goal or after they do, I think they should take the DOGE approach and make the federal government's budget a public streamlined website that we can all go in and the citizens can click into what the government spending money on and the citizens should be able to vote if we want a deeper dive on it or eliminate the expense. / []
Long live DOGE!!!! / []
They are definitely gaslighting the MAGA cultists.  Lying.  Too unintelligent to audit it using auditors. / []
I heard about the mine a dozen years ago or so, and would have thought they would have grown up by now. / []
Thank you all for joining Elon on this journey to find all the waste. 🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Why would anyone oppose this?? / []
These guys amazing team. Historical time / []
I, like many Americans trust what Doge is doing... those of us paying attention know and understand what the great job they are getting done..... / []
One learns very quickly why previous presidents got cold feet in trying to follow through with their promises to cut waste.  The task is multi-layered, messy, wide ranging, and ultimately not worth the political cost to what is being done now.  Yes, a scalpel is needed, not a hatchet, but wielded by fast and capable hands.  Dr. Doge is that surgeon. / []
Thank you guys a great team❤ / []
Absolutely astounding 🤯 / []
Keep going Elon you’re doing what we voted for. I’m sorry what the left are doing to you and your family and employees 🙏🇺🇸 / []
Wow, these guys are enormously talented! what an honor it is to have them bring us into the 21st-century / []
Over 200 ‘Tesla Takedown’ protests take place throughout US on ‘Global Day of Action’ against Elon Musk’s role with DOGE. Bravo !! / []
So why is felon musk avoiding the COMMITTEE HEARING?????????????🎯 I face this a thumbs down I'm sure like many , just sounds like horse shyt 🎯 / []
Love the DOGE team... old wealthy white men firing our vets.. this is disgusting... if Musk was a black African,  this would never fly.  This African should have nothing to do with our executive branch. He bought trump so he could run our nation. / ['Amazing how addicted you are to government control and dependency just like a indoctrinated🐑🐑']
I think there's some real evil out there and we have to overcome it - Elon / []
I appreciate the tech initiatives that are mentioned in this video. Databased not talking to each other and huge paper systems seem like a great place to add value to our government. What I don’t like is this farcical argument that anyone who disagrees must be a corrupt abuser of the systems. If we follow that reasoning he could literally do anything he wanted and could never be challenged because anyone who challenges would become a traitor. All of this talk about people not looking into the specifics, he needs to do the same thing for others, especially those that are getting harmed by his policies. The public sector job  market for well paying jobs is in the dumpster and government jobs are in high demand for their stability. Without government essential services and stable jobs the American citizens will suffer. Lastly, and maybe the worst, is his misrepresentation of how US debt works, claiming it is just like a household. Government spending is nothing like a household, and he completely neglects to mention our federal reserves system works. The government debt is normally tracked through government bonds to the American people. The government being in debt to the citizens in no way bankrupts the citizens. It’s the governments responsibility to pay those debts, and by the way the government always pays. The government has never not paid and if they were in such dire straights they could just raise taxes, especially on the billionaires. / []

I want to know why there isn’t something in the criteria of don’t point a finger unless you can put what I’m doing wrong words the Democrats keep knocking, and they have to have some reason and succession of reason to prove it wrong. There should be held on the accusing correct not what we do in Federal Courts.  I am stuck at oldies today, which is mostly yesterday’s update. I’m just sick over this. It’s so insane accusations. Unfounded. / []

A lot of promises, they need to talk about action not just goals / ['You might want to look at Elon’s business history. He was sued by the SEC for falsely tweeting he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share.. a move that misled investors and led to a $40 million settlement. \n\nHe promised affordable solar roofs and a $39,900 Cybertruck, but both were delayed or far more expensive. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” still isn’t fully autonomous, despite years of claims. \n\nAt X (formerly Twitter), he vowed to protect free speech, then banned critics and journalists']
Since the very first days of Doge and what they have accomplished... we know there is huge theft going on from congress and senate members getting rich from this theft...and we The American people those of us paying attention.....we will not take our eyes off that theft. We know who you are and we are just waiting for the days of when we see the get the cuffs....then get jail time for that theft Pelosi, Warren, the list goes on for a while. We know there are both Democrats and Republicans guilty of this theft but if nobody goes to jail we know we have been lied to once again....and nothing will ever change. Real change starts with jail time / []
A whole lot of great rhetoric and flashy words, but where is the actual evidence?  Doge is showing us spreadsheets that claim that they’ve saved money, but—well I’ll put it simply: Pictures, or it didn’t happen.  Very little critical thinking in this administration. / []

I agree with Elon and appreciate the efforts and witness of the DOGE team.  Great interview. / ['Right!? 😍 So glad DOGE finally got rid of those freeloading veterans. Do you really deserve all those benefits just because you didn’t die in combat? 🇺🇸 “the fundamental weakness of western civilization is empathy.” - Elon Musk', "@ Elon's view on empathy is applicable to the cutthroat business environment in which he competes and operates extremely successfully. He doesn't mean that a veteran doesn't deserve his benefits because of whatever good reason there is, which in cases, would require empathy with real hardships that all veterans and their families must endure; Elon understands that. I don't think that common Americans can understand that as exampled by your reaction to what you don't seem to understand.  Learn to understand more what people say instead of just reacting to words which, without context, cannot be fully understood."]

What an interesting tactic to have one actual interviewee and five other nameless bureaucrats to make it seem like there’s bipartisanship in their decision-making.

Please read the March 28, 2024 news article written by an excellent news reporter named Mike Silvia for the Fall River Reporter newspaper in Massachusetts about our (and other blue states') Homelessness-Industrial-Complex federal and state tax-funded profiteering schemes.

At the end of the day, MAGAs are Moochers and Democrats are Donors. DOGE doo doo voodoo and born yesterday  know nothing know it alls will not fix this. KY, AL, MS, TN and others are Moocher states that suck at the federal tit and take far more federal dollars than their states contribute. Meanwhile, NY, NJ, CT, CA, IL and a handful of others are Donor states that send far more federal tax dollars to DC than they get back. Thus, MAGAs are Moochers. If you want to save money just stop giving the MAGA Moochers more than they generate. In the meantime, these digital Dodos are not going to save anybody anything. If any of them worked for you you would fire them immediately and send them packing. If you really want to save money, privatize NASA. That alone would generate a one time windfall of $1+ Trillion plus an annual savings of $20 billion even if you give NASA $9 billion to continue its research. / []

Lol. Really....they are checking things thrice? Not possible. / []
This man needs to be paid for what he is doing. He is saving America from going broke! Please President Trump pay this man. He more than deserves this and promote his cars and SpaceX.

Great interview! / []
It's funny that none of them guys on stage is part of Elon Doge team / []
Democrats are mad because they're not getting their money.They funnel through the government to their bank accounts / []
Who still believes those people? 🤔 BTW , all those examples of efficiency of decades work. Why didn’t Trump fixed it all when he became president in 2016? This is so weird! / []
Once finished in the US , can the team please come to the UK. Fantastic work. / ["Why would you want this in UK don't Ya like to travel anywhere anymore 😊"]
The only people who should be complaining about all this. Are the ones in the industries who take advantage of government contracts. Because they know they can overcharge the government significantly and have easy peasy lifestyles off the backs of the taxpayers. This needs to end. / []
ruling 2-3 castes people constituting 15% of total Indian population of India has for century  mastered the art of dividing and ruling over 80% of unorganised indian population. These 2-3 previledged castes occupy 95% of all superior positions in the bureaucracy & judiciary in the country. They control press & media     I can't say if it is fully correct People say in north india the casteist daily newspapers which promote hatred among various unorganised castes in india in the lead is Hindustan Times, followed by Times of India, Hindu, Press Trust of India, Tribune, Jagran etc even indian express which was quite fair a decade ago has joined their wagon. These media houses also don't have much good words for Elon Musk (his tesla cars, exploded star ship, phone service), Trump, Vance & china ( forget about pakistan). For example some show  Trump licking feet of Elon Musk and putin. Elon Musk's star ship brought stranded Sunita Williams to earth. India's media had been full of glorifying news for Sunita Williams whose parents belongs to upper caste. This media totally blacked out goodness of Elon Musk whose space ship brought her down to earth when NASA & BAIDEN had failed miserably. She could have parished in space but for Elon Musk & Trump. These ungrateful castes are selfish of highest order. Similarly they blackout good deeds of other castes in india & unduly magnify as lead story of their small mistakes. On other hand they falsely glorify fake achievements of their castes & supress all heinous crimes of their castes. / []
A country which prints its own currency cant go bankrupt. Seems like a rocket scientist cant figure that out. / []

In this video are some of the most amazing patriots.  In my 62 years of life I have never seen such a selfless act in terms serving this cause with their immense talents.  They are going about this important work under such amazing obstacles.  The United States of America is grateful to you for sharing your valuable gifts and talent.  We have your back and see the big picture with you as we go through these important changes in our federal government.  May God bless you and keep you safe. / []
Country goes bankrupt the currency becomes worthless.  The govt. will still demand property taxes in a solvent currency.  Your property will be seized.  The corrupt Democrats and their rich Bezos type allies,  who have amassed fortunes converted into Swiss Francs or Chinese Yuan, will buy everything for relatively nothing.  Why they want the deficit to hit $60 trillion to collapse the dollar to nothing. / []
HOW COULD ANYONE BE AGAINST THIS?? / []
I’m so grateful to Bret for doing this interview. I hope many anti-DOGE will have the chance to watch this. Such a mind-boggling eye opener 🙏🏼🙌🏼👏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Every American should watch this interview and more new outlets should be interviewing this team of incredible patriots!  Thank you DOGE for what you are doing for our country and for the generations to come! / []
There were people who were taking out business loans and they had NO  business that was when Biden was in office or coarse they got the money ezzzzy pezzzzy and that was very wrong ❤ / []
Remember digitalisation comes with it own issues, computer says no lol / []
Gotta love Musk running the US government 😂❤ / []
I worked for DOD for 7 years. I left because 1. I couldn't do anything like Elon is trying to do - save the taxpayer money. I was trying on a small scale, but I got pushback at every turn. I was routinely told, "the government is in the business of spending, not saving." 2. Many employees - no, not all - were barely breathing. Literally sleeping at their desks. I get it - it happens in private sector too, but its nearly impossible to rid the organization of dead wood. 3. Archiac systems and processes with no incentive to improve.   I had to leave because i couldn't change anything and I was stuck trying to get things done against a brick wall. 'm glad there is something happening. I believe the government can save upwards of 40% in their operating costs nevermind spending on pork. / []
How is this prick allowed to bribe voters? Something very stinky in American government🤡 / []
This is the most important video so far this year. Thank you for giving back, its not everyday you see successful people serve like this. / []
God Bless Elon and Trump / []
ELON - SUKA! / []
Something that is not being discussed by the news reporters about the social security that will hurt some organizations is the fact that DOGE will come across fraudulent social security that has been purchased by an illegal on the dark web, etc. that they are using in America right now to make a living so they can be considered an American. Once they check that and cross check the jobs that those people work at, they will get immediately fired and possible deported as well. / []
We Love you Elon, Your doing a good thing for all of us patriots. THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. / []
We Love you Elon, Your doing a good thing for all of us patriots. THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. / []
"the people pushing the propaganda that caused that guy to do it (crimes against Tesla)" This is absolutely correct. These propaganda pushers are the real criminals. If you haven't already, pray for Elon, for all Tesla employees, and for DOGE. Call and write to your legislators to call out the instigations of violence against Tesla. God bless Elon and DOGE for saving our country. / []
DOGE, thanks for your service and commitment! / []
Can they fix the computers in the IRS to gather peoples income digitally bc tax season is brutal. / []
It is tough to hire good help and management these days💯 Keep America Great! Great work Elon💈 / []
This is astounding because for the majority of Real small businesses we can't get a grant. We are jumping through all kinds of hoops for a NO. / []
A peaceful company TESLA was and still should B Damnit! / []
Why wont they do this on ABC CBS and CNN / []
I read that the amount of subsidies to just TESLA is somewhere between $15-50 billion… perhaps not to far fetched to think that he will drain the US treasury/government even more now the sales are plummeting. Next Tesla report is 22 of April. Will be interesting for the shareholders and others…  In comparison - The DOGE is estimated to save $2.6 billion (Wall Street Journal). / []
Elon’s ending remarks about Ukraine were pretty powerful! Hard to argue against that imo. / []
There’s a difference between 830 million and a billion. / []
Only the recipients of the $$ are against it. Rational Americans are 100% behind Doge!!! / []
This is not journalism. / []
Not one black man or women in site / []
where big balls / []
Amen 🙏 / []
Laminated face criminal / []
We love you all, everything you are doing is helping the world. The dead state had a target of funding evil to the whole word. / []
Americans support doge / []
Restore FAITH😊 / []
Amazing / []
Inconceivable that this team of good hearted hardworking people could be the target of such hate and abuse for doing their jobs. / []
HERO s fighting fires daily as a SQUAD 🎉 / []
This is literally saving the country and free world. The us would otherwise go bankrupt in 10 years. / []
God bless president Trump, Elon, the DOGE team and everyone else involved for making this happen! This will go down in the history books as a very important event in American history! 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
DOGE Duty time!❤🎉 / []
REVOLUTION 🎉 / []
It seems not too many Americans are upset about this. This is horrible. Tired of being taking advantage of as a tax payer.  Thank you Doge and President Trump. / []
Correct / []
Fantastic interview. I want to see a bi weekly press release from all these guys. Maybe an appearance on the view? Lol. Brilliant work, thanks Bret. / []
Go DODGE 🎉😊😮 CEO? / []
Elon is the best billionaire ever, I can’t wait to get his neuralink implant in my brain / []
This is LEGITIMATE  NEWS 🎉 / []
Good luck getting a passport or replacing a lost social security card. About to be a lot of lost records soon… / []
As a patriot of Russia I feel disappointed much with the fact, that USA seems outperformed my country in corruption department too. / []
This is an excellent interview. I hope more people watch this. / []
Holy snaps 😊🎉😮 / []
White men... Just, white men. Very unbiased.😉 / []
their money is worth nothing if usa is broke thats why 😂 / []
Every American needs to watch this and hear the facts. Read these gentlemen, question what you've been led to believe. They're turning America 🇺🇸 around for the best! Much love amd God bless everyone who read this / []
I dare musk to give an interview on a real news organization. How can you believe this nonsense. Do any of you watch anything other than Trump propaganda networks. Do you believe that people are protesting musk and Tesla are victims of the Democratic deep state conspiracy theorists? Wake up people before it’s too late.   Get out of your ecosystem and watch something other than fox.  Please for the sake of our republic. / []
About 10+ years ago, I worked in a capital city.  Long story short a Business Owner wanted to build a Homeless Shelter for two reasons: Help the Homeless community and to also help the area around his investments (buildings). I don't believe he asked for tax funded grants, he was going to fund it himself and the city govt officials wouldn't allow him to build the shelter...I can't fact check this, I just thought it was interesting seeing how Private & Public Sectors operate / []
Why does the reporter feel the need to joke about flyer miles? Sick of the satus quo. / []
Love DOGE and  Elon! / []
Those Democrats politicians should be sue for promoting violence against inocent people who belongs those types of cars.  Also for making life miserable of those who were influenced by these politicians.  Free speech is fine but to promote violence is something else. / []
Thankbyou for your service! We do appreciate all of you and the work your doing! Everyone knows, that matters, this is the beginning of the end for the "Gangster Government" weve been subjected to. Thank you! / []
When you can't win the argument, name call without any basis. / []
A lot of common sense is represented there! It is a Revolution! God bless them with success and support! / []
The sheer number of unchecked lies in this interview is astounding. “Almost no one has been fired,” and “fraudsters are the ones who complain the most” regarding unreceived entitlement checks are two doozies. / []

Why would anyone be against this? The thief’s that’s who!! / []
They should make an app out of the website... / []
he really isnt great at live interviews lol / []
Misappropriations of Federal Grants for the Cops Programs by using highly illegal Cointelpro Tactics against innocent Conservative Americans that were illegally put on a Homeland Terroristic Watch List needs 5o be investigated NOW !

Giving the honest dependent people more money is genius 👏, chasing down those who take advantage of the system and make it so they get nothing anymore is brilliant...those 2 actions will be very powerful, might even cause problems in the streets...but necessary issues that need to be resolved... / []
How about taxing the rich? / []
Thank you Elon he should get % of what he finds lol still would make a killing... / []
How do you think secret alien space programs are funding without random ‘aid’ payments being made. 😂 / []
Once these social security fraudsters are caught are they going to be prosecuted? / []
Super awesome / []
There is only space for those who contribute to society... / []
Thank you M. Baier for the interview. DOGE needs to be celebrated nation wide. They need to have a DOGE day ! / []

There's a sector of humanity who believes that having both an analog and a digital version of a file is a beneficial and safe situation. These guys seem to be saying that no, analog versions of everything should be erased. This is hubris and not safe. / []
36 trillion = spending 1 billion dollars every day for 100 years. More needs to be cut, Elon, much more. / []
Elon is the greatest American hero in living memory. Wow / []
Trump/Vance Pam Bondi Elon Musk and the press Secretary, are strong leaders Thank You❤ / []
if what they're saying is true I hope they have a  3rd party verify it and present it. We're too polarized for people to believe them. It will be good for the country and morale if we can agree that there is progress, if there is infect progress being made / []
My-oh-my! Considering the circumstances, okay. / []
thank you Elon / []
What if "the revolution will not be televised" was a psychological operation? 🤔 / []
You all think Elon will be POTUS one day? / ['No, because he was born in South Africa.', "He can't be..", 'No because the US Constitution. 🤦🏻\u200d♀️']
What a beautiful interview and I think he had his darling little sun X there with him ❤ one time at least there was a precious connection like seemed between Elon and X at the end of this video… Amazing man, great people all together, lovely! / []
From The Netherlands: thank you for this amazing insight in what DOGE is doing and who are supervising it. Thank you Elon Musk and team. Please come to my country when you are done in the USA( or better still: to Brussels) .I'm certain its the same here. 🌷🇳🇱🕊🌎🇺🇲 / []

The mine is for document storage to meet document retention requirements. Good Lord / ['which is unnecessary.', '@DeadZ- and the most important thing was that they lied about it to begin with saying that it was for processing, but it wasn’t. It shows that they don’t understand how things work.']

Truly one of the best news interviews ever!!  Musk is a true American patriot! / ["He is meddling in so many country's elections. Is he a patriot in all of them?", 'DOGE is so brave. 😍 Slashing housing aid while keeping defense spending intact — finally someone brave is saying, ‘we’re not afraid to let the poor die for the pie charts.’ In the words of Elon “the weakness of western civilization is empathy.” I hope they get rid of Medicaid and the social security Ponzi scheme next!', '@lotusmilano the only responsibility of the federal government is national security that’s it and that includes border control. All the rest has been polluted and designed to enslave the citizens to government control via stealing their wealth, their labor, their private property rights and more importantly, their liberty and freedom.']
Elon Musk just deleted a tweet about offering Wisconsin voters 2 million dollars for their vote. Is Schimel in on this?. This is a felony in the state of Wisconsin! This billionaire is a criminal! Fight ! / ['Did you even watch the video?  get a grip.']
So proud and thankful for what this administration is doing to help our great country!!! / []
Bro, shut up and get to work. Let me know when my taxes are lower. / ['Total choad comment, get a grip']
nice spray tan brett / []
Wow. If only the left would watch this with opened ears. / []
Yea?! But where are the arrests. Not hard to find out who is recieving taxpayer money via theft, like Stacy Abrams. When will she get arrested. / []
Why can’t people really get this.. Don’t we want these folks to succeed? / ['They are listening to the MSM who now only does propaganda for the DNC.']
It’s awesome. They’re finding all these things, but I want to know where the money went who it went to and what’s going to happen to the people that illegally take this money. / ['Prosecutions will come next.', "Well a lot of it wasn't even labeled, so that might be hard. As long as it's fixed and we see the savings Ill take it."]
You can see the emotion in his eyes at the end of the video. FOR WHAT?  People are dying and no results are being shown. All for propaganda and bs virtue signaling / []
This is the single best interview or news piece you guys have had since Hannity sat down with the POTUS in the Oval Office.  Please, Fox, if you really want to lead the way for better press and reporting practices in this nation, do MORE OF THIS.  We don’t want opinions anymore.  We want the source.  Be that source, go ask the people involved some intelligent questions and get answers for the people.  We don’t want more mouthpieces, we want _answers._ / []

I can't count to a trillion. How many zero's? This is great news if you've from the United States and fairplay to them. Elon Musk's abilities have no competitor's. Department of Government Efficency Yes. DOGE'Y 😉 😜  As far as his troubles with people destruction of Tesla, I hope they get them as it's a total digrace. President As for  president Donald Trump goes, he's keeping his word. Thank's for the insights. Slainte ❤️ PS. Most of the world are not laughing at what they do but laughing with you on coruption. I wish he could come to Ireland. Slainte, Elon, and friends. Keep up the great work and Fox News. 👍❤ 38:41 / []
RESPECT!🇺🇸💯 / []
Everyone against DOGE is on the take / []
The White House should create a national broadcaster I mean every country has one the White House should create a national broadcaster purely putting out government information and reporting on government stuff. If you're listening Elon it's time to create a government broadcaster / []
"The president's plan is the only thing that will work." That statement made me believe Elon musk is either a time traveler or an alien / ['Musk’s statements about Trump remind me of North Korea broadcasting system talking about their leader.']
"....the most amount of fake righteous indignation. Is from the fraudsters."  Dems screaming in righteous indignation. Yep, makes perfect sense. / []
Keep going elon / []
Let Elon go before he destroys his entire company and his reputation. / ['Too late', 'That ship has sailed']
So no report, we’re supposed to just take his word for it? / []
Let them cook / []
If our government forces its citizens to pay into social security, state and Federal taxes politicians have a fiduciary duty to spend it only for what it is intended and to keep up with maintenance and update systems. If that is not happening why do we pay? Taxation without representation or protection. / []
Please please do a special during prime time on TV with this team. I believe it will clear up so many misconceptions about how and what they are doing. People need this clarification. It really should be a must see program. / []
Can anyone tell me, why anybody would oppose to the mission they are on.  No bias here, I'd really love to try and understand it. / ['I’ve been looking through comments for like 20 minutes cause I’m also fascinated by that question. Seems problem is they just don’t believe anything he says. I’m not seeing any disagreement that what’s in the video would be good(even the firings) but it’s easy to hold that position and still oppose DOGE if you believe it’s not going to deliver on those any of those goals. Cognitive dissonance is a plague on society']
Such a good point " The President (Trump) hasn't killed anyone" but those they say he's like killed a lot of people / []
Do they track the payments to the 120 yr olds? Who cashes the checks? / []
Where is the proof of any of this? How come there have been no progress with all these findings? WHO is verifying this? / ['I mean they’re only a few weeks in and they don’t have the direct authority to cut they just make the recommendations from what I understand and cabinets/their staff does the cuts but there has been progress didn’t you hear about all the firings then the San Francisco judge who halted the order forcing 15k or something employees back to work?', '\u2060@damienruzcoI think the idea, spirit behind this and the initiatives are all great but unless there is another department completely independent from DOGE that audits these findings it’s not credible. DOGE finds, another department verifies, I think most people will be happy with that.', '@johnmoney8802 ya that’s more or less what I’ve  heard them say repeatedly as to the current process and havnt really heard the opposing media outlets dispute that they just havnt really talked about it so that’s usually enough for me to assume something’s accurate lol\nIf so and if they keeps posting the cuts online they have my tentative support']

Freedom of speech? Why are they sucking up to the President so much? / ['I think that may just be called holding the same values/goals as him lol but probably some sucking too.

Where is ur suit Elon? / ['Petty', "@DeadZ-no it's not"]
Just look at the comments here!!!  I wouldn't be surprised to see segments of this aired as a commercial to show ALL what a great team Musk has assembled to save America from financial ruin.  MAGA!! / []

Elon is doing awesome. We’re lucky to have him more than lucky. It’s a blessing, but all the crooked people and our government they should be jailed and stripped of all their wealth. / []
My only disagreement with joe gebbla is that I believe we should keep a paper trail for any funds at least as a receipt. / []
wow, No wonder the left are doubling down the narrative to take down Elon and Tesla. / []
Elon plays to win😊 / []
This is all BS and now they are going after the people that don’t agree with them? Ok so this is not a free speech country anymore? Absolutely crazy!! People should be able to express and say what they think, you can’t obligate people to believe and/ or think the same way you do… / ['Woah that’s concerning. What instances are you referring to with them going after people who don’t agree/their free speech I havnt heard about that yet']

Cry harder, Elmo? Weren't you showing joy with that chainsaw before firing thousands of Americans and veterans from their job? Ruining their livelihoods. You are simply projecting and trying to play the victim. You're a coward.

Musk underestimates these highly complex systems. In 5 month to another programming language - impossible. Already the requirements collection phase lasts that long. What an amateur. In reality, at least 5 years. / ['This is one of the first criticisms I’ve seen that makes sense. Will it be absolutely necessary to completely alter programming language to link most of these systems?', '@damienruzco No, not necessary at all. Basically it makes sense to switch to a modern language because the Cobol programmers are dying away. But to state that such a project would be 5 months is insane. They cannot just go there and do "something", these are long projects over years that have to be carefully planned and tested. The laws and processes are complicated, they devs have to know exactly what they are doing.', '@maltimoto that’s wild I mean they’ve hired so many talented people how can they be so misinformed on that.

Elon Musk has openly stated that compassion is a problematic weakness in society. It’s hard to believe, then, that he does DOGE out of compassion — for the people. It’s certainly making the rich richer, but if it’s true that social security and health plans will also be improved, give credit where credit is due. Highly doubt it though. / ['Do you mean to say “empathy”? If do then I’m familiar with the statements you’re referring to. I don’t think he was saying it should be eliminated, just tempered which does make some sense. Too much empathy, while not bad for the world can be bad for the self.\nI don’t trust any of these dudes but I feel even if they only hit a quarter of their goals and every one of these guys gets kick backs for it, the utilitarian in me says whatever I’ll take it, better than nothing', '@ yeah might be “empathy” indeed, but my gut feeling about it doesn’t really change, because a lack of empathy often translates into a lack of motivation to help the ones in need and is the basis for egoism. And when society burns, the individual will too.', '@berkefeil5646 true. Supposedly the aid programs that would be considered important by the standard of “any rational person” will be continued through the state department mainly so I’ll reserve the right to retract my consent if that turns out to be untrue. It’s probably in their best interest to keep that promise though to maintain public support so not terribly concerned but been wrong before', '@berkefeil5646 I got the impression it was like a “don’t give $5 to the hobo on the street corner if your kids are wearing tattered clothes to school” kind of point rather than just “empathy should be disregarded mostly or completely” but this dude needs to learn not to make remotely vague statements cause half will use the least charitable interpretation and other half will presume as if Jesus himself said it']
Nothing but a PR stunt. We see right through your lies / ['Quite possibly but the way I see it, even if they only hit half or a quarter of their supposedly “very realistic goals” and even get kickbacks for it, that’ll still be a pretty beneficial for the country no?']
This place America is in is directly the result of democrats policies.  Once DOGE is done and smaller government is in motion, we will all see that there will be more jobs for those who lost theirs.  Continuing the way we have been is just kicking the can down the road for the next generation.  Thanks to President Trump and DOGE, the buck stops here! We as Americans must band together is support of this effort to bring us out of the suffocating debt all this borrowing has and is doing to us. THANK YOU DOGE! / []
Success depends on one’s own idea of “Success”.  Does “Success” require allowing the ship to sink in order to prep and birth a new one. Casualties inevitable?…. / []

I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE CAN BE AGAINST SAVING TAXPAYER  MONEY. / ['I think the people that are against it are the ones that are fraudulently benefiting from the way things are now and can see their scams coming to an end.

These guys are the knights of the round table and will save the future of America if left to do it ! / []
Elon is a smart guy but not the best at articulating issues, so it was a great idea for him to do this interview with other DOGE staff to support him to tell the story.  Also, they made really good points that indicate DOGE is doing crucial work that will impact the country very significantly for the better.  It is a shame that Tesla is being attacked for this.  May Elon and Tesla succeed passed these destructive antics and may he and Trump be vindicated when it all pays off.  It's often a few good men who do herculean tasks.

Elon's comments on the war in Ukraine are completely uninformed. Ridiculous. Mark Kelly didn't say anything wrong in his twitter post. To call him a traitor for that show's Musks misunderstanding of the situation. We should continue support, and in my opinion, we should increase support to Ukraine. If the west stops supporting Ukraine, it won't result in peace. It will result in Russia conquering Ukraine, followed by an insurgency. The violence will continue for years, if not decades. Only one person has the ability to make peace in Ukraine. That's Putin. Putin has shown no interest in peace. His demands are ridiculous. Also, Elon suggests that the war is a stalemate and that the front lines haven't moved in two years. But the Russian army has gained 4000 square kilometers in the past year. He seems to suggest that Ukraine could simply stop fighting and the war would end. Russia won't stop until the price becomes too much. The only way to get Russia to that point is by supporting Ukraine. Putin only understands one thing. Power. It's time for the United States to help Putin understand American firepower. / []
Thank you, DOGE!!! / []
Thank God there are wonderful human beings who still care enough to do this work.  Elon is right - there is real evil out there and it MUST be stopped. / []

can you help me develop a detailed and well-researched book on the topic of combating corruption and promoting ethical behavior?  Absolutely, I can help you outline the content and structure of the book, provide guidance on research, and suggest key points to cover.

Each chapter can be expanded with real-world examples, case studies, expert interviews, and practical tools. Conducting thorough research, citing reputable sources, and ensuring a well-structured narrative will be key to creating a detailed and well-researched book on this topic. / []

A suggestion for future interviews, which should be at least once a week, do what liberal media does...show interviews with people that have been defrauded through the social security fraudsters mentioned here, maybe a retiree that had to go through the training in order to retire in 6 months, etc.  Put faces with the stories, I believe that will gain much support. / []

I don't get it. Why were so many people fired instantly? As a project manager and developer, I still don't understand.

The fraudsters they're referring to, im sure are connected to the federal government somehow. So the system that allows this to happen, is there on purpose. / []
"Basically no one has gotten fired" .. the only statement of this interview I have an issue with.  Maybe across the states the number of people fired feels like, no one in the total number of employee's but more than 50 in one state alone at one stab isn't no one. It isn't no one to the person and people getting fired. One days notice to end of employment is about as fired as it gets.  The process of change isn't pretty. Looking forward to seeing the positive outcome on the other side. I believe and hope that the greater good will truly be served through this process. / []

DOGE has pointed out the Democrats plan to end the two party system in the U.S.    Mass illegal immigration to the swing states, where they will likely get to vote, will make those states permanently Blue.

Then they will pack the Supreme Court giving them control over all three branches of government.   The result is a country without Democracy. / []

"You know who complains the loudest—with the most exaggerated, fake righteous indignation? The fraudsters." That’s the message the billionaires in this administration keep hammering. It’s straight out of the old fascist playbook: discredit dissent, crush opposition, and flip the narrative. But let’s be clear—it simply isn’t true.  So ask yourself: who actually complains the loudest, with the most performative outrage? I’ll just leave these here:  "This is the greatest witch hunt of all time." "I’m the most persecuted person in American history." Hypocrisy isn’t the exception. It’s the method. / []

“If our federal government were a private company, it would go bankrupt immediately, it would be de-listed and the officers would be arrested” - Elon Musk / []
Dear President Trump, I’m one of those people who supports you. I know you’re a businessman and a smart guy, and I’ve got a lot of respect for that. But I’ve got a question about our country’s national security that’s been on my mind—specifically about our space programs, the FAA, and NOAA. To me, these are things that need to always be controlled by the government and supervised by our top security agents to keep America safe and secure. Here’s my concern: Is Elon Musk “scamming” the USA by dissolving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to benefit his company, SpaceX? There are concerns and allegations swirling around about his influence over federal agencies and contracts, especially since he’s running your Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). From what I can see, it looks like he’s playing that role to his company’s advantage. Can you set me straight on this? I trust you to look out for us. / []
Thank you Elon, Thank You DoGE and Thank you President Trump. ❤ / []
Seeing the behind-the-scenes of Musk and the DOGE team reminds us that even viral projects require vision, discipline, and real-world execution. How much of this mission is meme—versus meaningful innovation? / []

Americans that congress men using tax dollars like a ATM even for their individual democrat adds and a machine programed spitting out billions every day no accountability. Elon wow excellent work . / []
honestly, if the Dems could get their heads out of their backside, they would understand the sacrifices Musk has made, and they would be able to see the national treasure he is for our country. the FOX interview with the whole DOGE team was awesome.

If you make things easier with computers, hackers can easily hack into them just like thieves can hack into the headlight of a car and access the computer through the headlight and steal the car. Doing things old-fashioned can be safer. Maybe that is why they have all those social security retiring papers on paper like that. But like they say, it can also be fraudulent. It's tough. It's a big dilemma.  Even with credit cards and debit cards we are having problems people hacking our information.   I think the best way is doing everything manually and old-fashioned by hand but more efficient with people's information. Computer can be to easy to hack with even little teenage kids who learn that stuff so young. / []

Absolute lies if they were being so careful there wouldn't be so many instances where they have had to rehire people. There wouldn't be math mistakes on their wall of receipts. They wouldn't be deleting receipts off the walls when people have pointed out inaccuracies. People wouldn't be so upset if they were being careful and what they were doing was actually liked. Here are some specifics for you; cutting national park workers has many, many people upset. Cutting workers and offices within social security also has many people upset because you can not expect elderly people to navigate a website or to be going into offices. Closing offices also makes that pretty hard to do. Also just because someone is listed in social security doesn't mean they are getting benefits. This has been fact checked and debunked. Stop lying. Twisting the truth about what funds are actually being used for is also why people are upset. Those of us with real common sense know money wasn't spent "making mice transgender". People are also upset about cutting medical research and halting medical trials that are in progress. I could go on and on. Are you deleting any comments that are negative? Sure looks like it. Also looks like you've got a bunch of bots to leave positive comments. Talk about propaganda and censoring! / []

How is supporting Ukraine’s fight for independence, sovereignty, and protecting their families against the interests of the U.S.?.?Ukrainians want peace more than anyone, but they can't end the war when Russia started it. Instead of helping, your words support Putin's propaganda.  Why not pressure Putin, who has said he won't stop attacking? Blaming Ukraine for not stopping the war is unfair when you offer no real solutions yourself.  Pushing Ukraine to give up is not seeking peace, it’s abandoning people there and supporting tyranny. Ukrainians deserve true support in their fight for freedom, not strategies that threaten their existence. / []

Instead of taxpayers being mad, we are beginning to understand why we need to fire our current elected officials, and most of their staff! / ['People that want to go to the lake, in an RV, are worried about social security paying their rent on the lake lot. \n\nSocial Security is a terrible return on a "mandatory" investment!', 'No government shutdown stopped me, or my family from eating!

Watch CNN and MSNBC and the rest of the mainstream media try to spin this as Elon and his team trying to ransack the government and enrich themselves or whatever spin they can do to obfuscate the fact that the gravy train is over for many people that did not deserve to be getting paid or receiving benefits from the government. I applaud Elon and his team for doing this. / []
These DOGE people are saving our country 🇺🇸👏 / []
I’m old school, and I can see the value of paper. It’s virtually impossible to hack, but it’s incredibly inefficient. Especially, when you’re working with millions of pages of paper.  I know that a computer is vulnerable to hackers, but only if that computer is connected to the internet. I realize that if you have a computer in a secure room, and that computer has no connection to anything outside of that room, it will be impossible to hack.  Problem solved. / []
DOGE IS saving America! / []
Looks like all the democrat agitators are missing.  Darkness disappears with light!  Jesus is the light of the world! / []
And still people are going to accuse Elon and Trump of destroying america. So many sick freaks out there who just don't understand what's happening / []
I’ve got a bridge to sell you / []

If this team were doing this in RSA they would be gunned down.  Every country should have competent ethical DOGE team / []
THANK YOU! So refreshing to see real leadership and common sense again. It was getting out of control and I hope we can continue on this path. Thumbs up if you agree! / []
We, Americans owe DOGE & President Trump a tremendous gratitude! America is the only one country in the world still maintaining DEMOCRACY! ❤❤❤ they are trying to keep this democracy to survive ❤ / []

corrupted people don’t want Doge.  like gangster hated police.  who is the ganster in the government:  Democrats ….who else.  these gangsters are so big that even our president and government walk on the thin line not to expose them to the public. / []
Show this video to the whole nation.  Elon Musk and his team are doing a great fantastic amazing job for the American people.  Imagine uncovering trillions of wasteful spending from taxpayers money. Why on earth are the democrats and the leftist hate a man who is helping reduce waste and corruption in the government and some private sectors?  Instead, we should thank them for their service. I really want everyone who watches this video to share it with everyone they know.  God bless DOGE. / []
Thank you All ... DOGE 😢 / []
Awesome interview ! Thank you Doge 🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Tesla owners should be legally able to stop any destruction of their vehicles in any way possible using any means possible. / []
Excellent interview by Mr Bret Baier to keep it professional, and to just to keep it real as an objective journalist. / []
Excellent, Deployed Through The TRUTH Network… Thank You 🙏 ❤ / []
Elon is the Rockefeller of our age , he's the rich that wants to give back / []
Wow!. Man is so right!. I love America!!! / []
1020billion.. ideas !! / []
I agree with everything said 100%, but why the mass firings.... why... everything said I wholeheartedly believe, but why not empower the employees with the knowledge to fix this and then figure out a drawdown.  I think they cut the legs out first for an easy,quick "win" without thinking it through. Also, we a "doge" approach in the house desperately more than the executive branch, look at their cost to employee ratio... / []
This is a must story that all Americans need to hear.  This is truly the most important governmental group taking action to improve our country.  Thank you President Trump and the DOGE team... / []
This was a very good interview and it’s great to put faces and personalities into who is the DOGE Team. It’s not easy to make the changes that need to be done for a healthy America but it’s got to be done! And Elon is correct when he says “those who are screeching the loudest are usually the ones who are the most guilty”. / []
You cant get more transparent than this / []
Determining the single source of truth in such a huge organization is a big job. Great work Doge team 👍 / []
MARK KELLY is a NASTY HATEFUL pretender and a propogandist who hates  America and ALL CONSERVATIVES— You betcha! I’m a Native Arizonan - I KNOW. / []

Listen.  I'm nearly broke after losing my business during covid and 2 homes during divorce.  Can I buy any of these guys lunch?  Can I send $1,000 for catering?  I moved back in with my parents but know that my future is being saved and improved by these men / []
Most of what these fraudsters have said, id like to see them under oath in a courtroom repeat their lies. Amazing propaganda piece. / []
Great Work! / []
Tyrant Elon’s Steering Lies through America / []
That only took 4.5 min to praise his king LOL.  Nobody under trump can talk about anything without praising him,  that is a requirement in a cult. / []

All of your efforts are truly appreciated and so impactful on so many peoples lives. Priceless!!!!!! / []
When the whole world wanted to know who was behind DOGE lol / []
What a wonderful team of patriots. Lucky America 🇺🇸 / []
I’m thankful for everyone that’s on this DOGE team. Instead of trying to stop them from the work they’re doing to help American we could be commending them for their service. Brett Baier did a stellar job on this interview. I hope this interview goes viral, everyone needs to watch this! / []
@37:11 somebody let that dog outside! / []
Thank you Mr Heroes. You are all common sense Americans. We the people, real Americans admire you and very thankful the hard work you re doing in straightening out and cleaning up the mess.

Elon finally looks spooked in this clip, like his current TSLA shareholders and employees. Poor MUSKie rascal 😨 / []
its INSANE !! / []
Day of the jackel / []
Why they even need to explain themselves is ridiculous!!! Go Trump and I hope Elon finds each and every fraudulent F@ker and they be hold accountable!! / []
DOGE is what it would look like if white people created a "gang," kinda like the Masons back in the late 18th century. / ['The Builders are in control.']
So if you are deleting info that doge already copied you are going to get caught. / []
I am going to say something that may sound a little "woo-woo" but I can't help but notice these kinds of things sometimes. Look at the eyes of all the men here speaking to us. The eyes of everyone of them are shinny. They are also guileless truthful eyes. These men are telling us the truth, because they are truthful people. You can see it in their eyes. And they are living honorable lives. That also comes through. / []
Pies in the sky! Pies in the sky for everyone!! Don't forget to grab your pie in the sky on your way out!!! / []
This is truly a remarkable time. Modern technology is being used comb theough a system that has taken advantage of Americans for decades. / []
The government makes all these technical advancements and then refuses to update the tech that’s tracking them. Seems intentional. / []
Anyone else hear a woman crying in the back ground at 37:06   mark. / []
Thank you so much Elon Musk, who is a true hero for USA, and even the world.  Why would anyone be against Musk's ending of wasteful spending?  For the last several years the reason for EVERYTHING to explain the globalist Democrat lies, regulations, and tyranny to no end, was due to climate change.  Nevermind that the CCP ramps up every last form of energy to continue to make sure that China's, Xi's missile are always pointed at the USA.  The Democrats fully embraced electric cars for all these years.  So, why would there be anyone, especially the Democrats to fight AGAINST clean energy, and against those that want to expose wasteful spending? / ['Happy days are here again, for all Americans and the world :)']
The clam Elon is trying to take social  security  is stupid,  it's the dems trying to make us hate Elon,  if anyone  takes social security  after we have all payed  it's going to turn in to civil war# 2 / []
Love Elon. And I appreciate him even more listening to his responses from this interview. He loves this country, and he was not even born from here, but those who were, some of them hated this country and could csre less what could happen to it. / []
Every American should watch this video.  Even President Boasberg. / []
Russia fool dangerous. In county going wars ! Don’t talk with Russ. / []
Musk is a patriot and hero for Americans and the world! / []
what was that in the background at the end, a dog whining? / []
People liking fox news now ?? / []
Elon we need you and your team here in South Africa / []
Thank you Elon 🙏 / []
The USA is a really tolerant country and I salute you all for that. A South African national accuses a senator, a decorated veteran who fought for his nation for being a traitor and no one says anything. I can’t think of any other country where this would be ok. / []
lets goooooooo team DOGE!!!!!!!  MAD respect to these guys!!! they get my support! shut these mfers down! / []

So I had my democrats father in law watch this and he refused to believe it…that’s how brainwashed some people are. / []
No person that has common sense can not agree with this team and the job they do.  Unless you are unpatriotic and want our nation to go to hell could you oppose the work they do. / []
Would be great if they can trace where the money went to or who issued those payments to certain weird programs. Who can they identify as to who they should held accountable for the fraudulent transactions that they found. / []
12:48 that’s because those 150 year olds are Vampires!😂 / []

It's amazing how this group of people are doing a great service for each taxpayer and for this country. I agree with Elon, those who complain about the job they do  should be investigated because it does not make sense why they would complain about people who are billionaires and not getting paid to try to look out for our monies. / []
Thank you so much DOGE Team. Love you all❤❤ / []
Yes, I worked for the Government, I retired Dec of 24. This is the end of March 25, still waiting for my first paycheck. / []

Elon...you are brilliant. Still...I feel like there has been a bit of true heroism...even innocence in the wonder of the corruption of it all.   God bless...you❤ and welcome to  the other horrors of evil.  Perhaps, you will consider part timers who have experience and are anxious to help with DOGE...you may be surprised!😊 / []

Great interview! Removes the bs mystery that nees media tries to spin / []
The last 30 seconds are extremely powerful! / []
I am thankful to Elon and all these men and I am sure women behind the scenes on this huge team. They are putting a pause in their careers, lives and families to do this. They did not have to do this. We owe them a debt of gratitude for all the corruption they have discovered. Now, we know why Social Security was going insolvent, sludge funds, corrupted politicians as well as NGOs, departments etc. / []
Please give us more of DOGE and Musk. / []
Any pundit criticizing DOGE is not a true journalist. They are a bought operative. Evil is revealing itself. Their arguments are so illogical that many people are waking up to the gaslighting, virtue signaling, and lies. / []

This group sounds like a bunch of patriots to me. They all have something else to be doing but have come to the service of their country. Democrats don’t understand patriotism. That’s why they’re where they are moaning and threatening. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []

Elon is not a dictator, if you have followed his journey, his family history, listening even to his ex's ,, he doesnt come across evil, just driven, he has autism so he may demonstate a temper or awkwardness with emotion, but its not his being a nariscisst its autistic type behavour / []

Share this with every Democrat you know!! / []
There's some good sruff here but let's move on and stop blaming it all on Biden. For example saying the left flip flopped on EVs --- for crying out loud Trump was profoundly anti-EV and anti-climate, now he's selling Teslas from the Whitehouse. / []

Thank you for all you do, Brett, Elon and the DOGE crew!  USA winning because of you! / []
Just curious why you can’t provide ANY verifiable proof of your fantastic claims. Will to debate him any time, any place any where except his home country of Russia. / []
I was all in till the end!!! Who invaded Ukraine in an act of war? Russia lead by Putin! Want to stop all the people from dying then Putin needs to undo the invasion! So many Russians have died they are using N. Korean troops!!! How would Elon and Trump feel if Canada or Mexico were to invade us because of what ever? Granted that would never happen because we would crush them, but rhetorically speaking you don’t just “give up” in what is essentially a stalemate! Ukraine has very bravely defended itself, and deserves independence and most of their land! Any kind of ceasefire needs to have guarantees! / []
Excellent / []
Funny he didn't mention Elons grandparents were smazies who relocated in Canada not by choice.😮 / ['And? He is not.']

I'm just wondering, does the entire world need to hear all this about the US financial account, etc.? / []
0.15% is actually getting fired, why did Elon say “nobody” is being fired? Just say, if you are fired, you are carefully selected lol😂 / []

This group is fantastic!! This is the first time in American history a President has created a super group to investigate how crooked our government actually is. No wonder the Democrats are butt hurt. They are losing their gravy train / []
It is all exaggeration and lies! Where is his back up? There is no elevator and when he shows numbers they are all wrong. / []
That was intense - I’ve never seen Elon so serious and affected by what’s going on. I believe this level of corruption and wasted is on a scale we haven’t fully grasped yet. I feel so fortunate as an American to have a team of this caliber working on our behalf as citizens. / []
Ok serious question here.. which one of these guys is “ Big Ball’s” / []

Who elected Elon for president it wasn't america. / []
These idiots don't know Musk from Shinola.  They act like they're playing a video game. Muskrat is cancelling contracts but none where his companies are involved.  Real 'waste'  is giving tax cuts to people that already have more money than they can comprehend. Governments are built to defend  and take care of its citizens needs. It's not a corporate entity to be streamlined to show shareholders a profit. / []

What an eye opener to hear how archaic our computer/filing systems in government are and how they affect the government. Budget/ all gov branches.

hardworking american understands DODGE my husband and I always go through our accounts , spending part, bills , calculatiing every savings we could set a side.

Musk looks tired. / ['Tariffs announced on adrenachrome and baby’s blood recently']
Is a 15% reduction of government spending really beneficial if it requires the economy to tank?  I see a lot of unemployed people in a flooded market. A market that doesn’t support hiring because the market is in free fall, erratic tariff policies, and wages are below a living wage. All while eliminating the safety net programs that help the poor survive leading to a significant reduction in tax revenue from poor and working class  Americans is the outcome.   That just doesn’t make sense. / []
We need the state of Florida to DOGE, so that they can discover family and friends in important positions in the state, and that they see the Plan 8, and the low-income housing in the businesses and the checks of retirees who receive 872 dollars monthly. / []

Fantastic work men!!! May you all have blessed journey's. / []
Absolutely amazing that both Democrats and Republicans and Libertarians everyone’s been screaming about political corruption and where is all the money going? How can we stop this and now somebody’s doing something to stop it and they are being criticized left and right about this it’s absolutely unreal. why would you complain about stopping your tax dollars from being wastedwhen I see these comments? I have to think that it’s bots or just a group of people that are purposely trying to push some kind of propaganda because I can’t see how one American would complain even in a little bit about stopping your tax dollars from being wasted. And stolen by scumbags / []
I hope Elon can stay on past the 130 days  in some capacity as an advisor, coach, mentor, whatever. / []
Well done Brett. Excellent interview. Doge  and everyone involved is Making America Great Again. Literally. 🇺🇸 Trump and Elon have done more for this Country in 3 months than Biden, Obama and Company did in 4 years. God Bless and Stay Safe 🇺🇸🙏❣️🇺🇸 / []
People are worried about the texting and not the innocent lives these terrorists were planning on taking away with their evil planning! / []

They hate how good this is. Because how wrong this makes them. / []
This sounds excellent but some of the legitimate criticisms should have been raised like money going to luxury hotels and the wrong Gaza being mentioned. So much information has been wrong and the answer of ‘we will get some stuff wrong’ is not good enough. You guys are meant to be the most competent people in the US, use Grok or something to thoroughly check before you post stuff!! But it’s an excellent thing to do so congratulations on that, don’t ruin it by lack of thoroughness / []

Phenomenal Interview. / ["Do you find it interesting that musk is scared to take questions from the other side? I mean he was supposed to speak with Jon Stewart but got scared and called it off. He doesn't want to address congress about anything. He only speaks in generalities. He has always made high promises that never hit the mark. (Boring tunnel is an example where he said by 2024 he would have cities connected by fast travel tunnels). I mean it's one thing to be wrong but he's either lying bullshitting or just incredibly stupid if he thought the tunnel system would grow that fast in that amount of time and now it's completely abandoned by him.\n\nHe also said he was a top pro gamer for a game in which it was obvious he paid someone to pretend to be him and level up his character. I mean this is the level of childishness we have going on here."]

Compare the comunicative skills and willingness to answer direct questions to the nonsense word salad mutterings of our elected "representatives".  It should be clear that anyone resisting the changes this team is putting forward is clearly benefitting from the present way of doing things.  I'm beginning to think that the entire federal government has become a monumental money laundering operation.  I always knew our government was stealing from it's taxpayers however, I never imagined the magnitude which is being uncovered.  I would categorize such actions as seditious and should be dealt with accordingly in a court of law...not by vigilantism.  That is the method of the left. / []
Elon Musk is an imagrint and knows nothing about America. He is the one scamming America. His electric EV is costing America billions because of his failures.

This... Is actually good.... Iv been against Trump... But I think... Elon may be doing us good... I dont know yet... But Iv always known that the government has been corrupt, and purposely had things like this cave exist TO slow things down. Or keep things at a certain pace... Iv seen computers at government offices and stuff..... And the software they use, plus all FSSA sites, and the phone system is all living in the 90s.. And clearly there are still things that havent been updated from the 1900s  I repair and fix computers on the side because I taught myself alot about my own computers just for gaming. So iv noticed alot of inefficiencies first hand in the government... It alot like manufacturing obsolescence, which Thomas Edison did with the light bulb and they still do to this day... They were able to make light bulbs that lasted 100's of times longer.. Apple is known for manufacturing product obsolescence... Creating software updates to no longer be quite compatible with the battery, or just flat out "pretends" the battery just isnt charging right... So you gotta get that new 1000$ iPhone! Its despicable and why I cant support Trump, and billionaires... I believe they shouldn't exist, no individual needs literally 10000's of lifetimes worth of money... When you KNOW they have to stomp all over the peoples backs and siphon those profits from us... We are the ones that ultimately pay by not gaining what we should.. The lobbyists have focused on minimum wage and kept it as low as they can possibly keep it by ultimately buying the laws we are supposed to be deciding on...  This is something iv always noticed, and even the guy interviewing him doesnt understand tech either and how the implementation will relieve so much stress on the government that it literally makes you wonder how a system with the FBI, CIA and the military industrial complex could allow the other programs of the government lag so far behind... It has always blown my mind how out of touch the government is....  If anythng...... I reach out to Elon, and beg for him to stay true to us, and keep his word / []

Oh, I expected this. The promises to balance the budget are thrown away, now they are just trying to cut the deficit in half. Then they will set the goal to cut by 25% and will end up with a 10% cut, celebrating a big victory.   Because one can't balance this budget merely by making popular decisions, such as stopping payments to 300-years old and closing the Guatemalan transgender theaters.

WAKE UP DUMMIES! / ['Let’s say there is a quid pro quo with every single one of these guys and the Tesla thing is certainly concerning and should be investigated thoroughly, I’m curious how you mean we end up with a bigger deficit then when he took office as a result of DOGE\nIt sound like but I assume you don’t mean due to kick backs. They’re talking about a goal of 1 Trillion cut as a “very realistic goal” but let’s say they barely even reach half. He could give a dozen 400 mil contracts to each one of them and we’re not even close to being in the red?']
God bless Elon Musk! / []
America is broke, bankrupt, and will never pay back $35 TRILLION!! DOGE is a revolution in trying to get this corrected. Everyone needs to get out of the way! God bless these efforts to save us! / []

People don't be so naive this was all talk no result shown to demonstrate the progress that has been made & cutting the funds the ppl uses after the ppl just sat by and watch America send hundred millions to other countries for war really makes no sense seems like we need new officials these ppl like arguing instead of working together towards solutions. / []

The goal is definitely clear - the dem 'leaders' want their status quo of all agencies to remain dysfunctional so they can continue collecting monthly checks for people over 120 years going into 'their' accounts, etc., etc..... / []

And I also want to thank everybody sitting in that room on the video thank you. / []
This should be known to everyone. Then again alot of people would still argue and say bad bad elon and orange man.

A group of people that have seen and dealt with ignorance and have persevered, We only want to help people. / []
I literally cannot understand how someone can be against this. How is there so much hate for this? / ['Probably because it’s the same kind of logic that IT corporations use. Layoff -> outsource, function for less. \n\nIt’s the reason most tech support is outsourcing, and we all love tech support, don’t we.', 'I’ve been looking through comments for em cause I’m also interested in that question. Seems problem is they just don’t believe anything he says. I’m not seeing any disagreement that what’s in the video would be good but it’s easy to hold that position and still oppose DOGE if you believe it’s not going to deliver on those goals.

Ty, POTUS Trump and Elon for Making America Great Again! Proud of everyone doing their part and what they can. / []
putin/russia has violated 190 agreements over the past 26 years, maybe elon and trump should take a history lesson. / ['True though with context outside of sorta kinda the first Chechen war (which isn’t really comparable) they’ve never gotten kicked in the teeth nearly this hard.

They were in an utterly pathetic state when he began this attempt\n\nWould you agree?']
Great interview. / []
Bret Baier, that was your best interview to date. Well thought out questions. Elon & the DOGE team did an excellent job explaining the processes, where the problems lay & what we can expect.  Well done to all involved! / ['i would like to hear some tougher questions for elon though, his musk foundation for instance seems to have been a way for him to avoid tax and funnel money into his other companies. it was being used to fund openai for instance. how is that charity? its also not clear to me if they are satisfying the rule of donating a minimum of 5% of assets each year, and would like to hear him clarify this himself.', "@enterpassword3313 I believe you missed the point of the interview.  It was about what Elon & the DOGE team's area of responsibilities, their findings & the fixes needed.", '\u200b@debbiebutler3020no, i didnt miss that actually. i am saying that it would be good if he ALSO asked him some tough questions.. what are your thoughts on what i mention about his foundation?', 'In my opinion, it was not the time or the place. \u200b@enterpassword3313', '@debbiebutler3020 why wouldnt you care about cheating the sytem when elon does it if you care about it when others do it???']
Awesome / []
look at gen x scoolin the boomer class / []
I could have watched another hour of the interview with the team and another hour of the interview with Elon - very insightful and informative. This is transparency. / []

It is nice to see a face instead of just a name, I deal with thousands of people and names only matter if you have been an issue. / []
A BILLION IN WASTE 🥲  This money could help We the People.  I just makes me cry 😢 we couldn’t trust our government. / []
Scammers have been having a field day the last 2 months because they're calling Grandma and saying they're from DOGE trying to confirm their social security number and account details... / ['Dang I didn’t think about that but makes sense.

This team are patriotic people / []
Release the names of anyone fighting back so they get voted out / []
Who balances that BIG account that is used? ???? / []
Wonderful!  Thank you to all the 7 brilliant minds here with Elon and all their team and for our great President Trump getting Elon and all of them to save our USA from bankruptcy; for our future kids and grandkids to have a USA that will prosper and without debt.  Video of Obama has been making the rounds on the internet back in 2011 saying this exact stuff needed to be done; not going to be pleasant he said, but it's necessary. It seems he didn't have the brilliant people to tackle it like we do now, but he knew it needed to be done; the far left cannot argue with that. But of course their looney minds will always find issue when the republicans are who are saving the USA. / []
Let’s follow the money, it goes back to the top, congress is allowing g and approving this waste / []
We THE PEOPLE DID NOT MAKE THE AMERICAN DEBT THE GOVERNMENT AND HUMANS IN IT !! WE THE PEOPLE NEED HELP WITH INFLATION THAT THOSE GOVERNMENT HUMANS DID TO AMERICA! HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PLEASE 🙏 / []
Deport Elon! / ['Or at least confine him to like North Dakota. That would probably be even worse']
God bless you ALL!!! The demons of hell will NOT WIN!! Thank you Elon and team!!!! / []
I have so much respect for Elon.  Just a few. years ago he was voting for Obama. I pray for him and also our President their families. / []
Viva Trump Musk 💪💪💪 / []
Love this so much !!! ❤ / []
We know that billion dollars that went to someone for an online survey asking if they like the state parks is laundering!  They have to show they paid it to something that some idiots wouldn’t question or would think it’s an important project but the money goes to some group that started attacks on president Trump, traveled around with Antifa bailing them out, helped launder money to fake charity funds like the one Hillary had and many other top Democrat and Republican corrupt politicians. / []
Someone suggested that we need an amendment to the US Constitution that states the Communist Party, the Marxist Party, the Socialist Party are banned from America. I would take it further and state, in addition to the above organizations, any other organizations that demand the killings of infidels must be banned from America! Now that we have a Republican President and a Republican majority, it is time to pass this Amendment! Enough is enough! / []
Wow. This was absolutely powerful. Pure, genuine patriots for the greatest country on earth! God bless these men and our president! / []
And making themselves feel better while people keep right on dying / ['What do you mean?']

We all knew this was going on. / ['Going through the comments it’s not that any of them seem to be against it, it’s that they just don’t believe a word he says.

All good. Hope they don't use the information for their own benefits. They may get ride of all these and then get gov contracts for their own system, privatizing all gov processes and generating lots of profit for them self. / ['Honestly probably will be some of that though it will have to be fairly limited considering highly motivated investigators will be watching like hawks for it. \nStill the utilitarian in me says fine whatever, even if he gave them hundreds of millions for free no contract for anything in return, it’s hardly even a drop in the bucket if they even reach half of their “very realistic goal” of $1trillion saved right?', '\u200b@damienruzco  history of american corporate greed is not pretty.

Does anyone know if any of these men are being paid? Assume no like Elon. / []
I voted for Trump and I had hope for DOGE and I used to work for Elon Musk. I don’t get why they have to lie and make things seem bigger than they are. There is no way the survey itself cost the government a billion dollars. They should have other facts that they can go to. Even if the real cost of the survey was tens of thousands of dollars it’s a good example.  When the people who voted for this crew can’t believe these stories of spending it’s a problem. It can’t be true. I feel strongly that if we lied at those numbers it’s not correct. / []

Any of you sycophants realize Trump added $8 trillion to the deficit in his first term and the budget he proposed this month adds another $4 trillion to the deficit this year alone! Biden added $4 trillion in his entire 4 years..  Wake up! / ['Ok I agree that’s certainly a very bad thing even in context of Covid/CARES act and what not.

(Something the right is just as guilty of quite often if not more often)', "@damienruzco  If DOGE's goal is to cut $1 Trillion but Trump's budget is adding $4 Trillion to the debt, it's one step up and three trillion steps back. Trump's budget should be balanced and then DOGE's impact would matter.....This makes me think DOGE's real agenda is to protect Elon's gov contracts and pull the funding from his competitors and more importantly hard working Americans (esp the poor and seniors)."]
I admire Elon Musk, for the the his sincere idea, honest, and intelligent to make everything to US. I am from Indonesia, and we must learn how to make a system to eliminate corruption, frauds, and to make sure that all tax are carefully controlled for the benefit of social and public service,  I love the way you Captaining DOGDE and wish that many nations, us Indonesia,  must do such revolution, superb job, congratulation DODGE / []
I’m confused as to why the very people wasting, stealing, mismanaging, and laundering tax payer monies are getting such  cushy and generous payout to leave? / ['Not worth the time/$ to keep them on the payroll until you can indivdually prove each one was knowingly complicit in wrongdoing.', 'And if you label them all guilty till proven innocent and give them the boot with nothing, the left would now have an actually real and good talking point to hurt public perception badly.\nCan’t risk the whole project']

Yeah, but the Democrats are very corrupt political party and they don’t want anyone to know what they’ve been up to. They don’t care about the American people. They blew it with 2020 pandemic in January February 2020 when the committee for whatever it’s called for pandemics was all Democrat and came out and told President Trump lol nothing to worry about and they all five dumped their stock. Feinstein was one of them.  I worked for a director of Morgan Stanley at the time and she went into shock. She was so pissed. She said they deserve to get Covid and die. / []

Just let it sink in that the democrats are actively fighting against this! With Schumer saying how dare we want to keep more of the money we earn - taxes are government theft and the fact that we are taxed repeatedly on the same money is illegal. / []

Good job 👏👍🎉 / []
Thank you, guys!!   And for Bret   to put together this interview for everyone to see and  to beware about what is going on behind. / []
Absolutely agree as a Business Systems Analyst! / []
Thanks Elon and Doge team for what you're doing. I can't understand why the left is so upset besides the money and control.  We appreciate everything! / []
A lot of this won’t happen is Congress doesn’t cut spending. That takes a spine. / []
God Bless all these  Patriots. Thank you for your sacrifices ! / []
Wow. The new rightwing propaganda does it again. More lies from Elon. Can we put him on one of those totaly legal deportation flights? / []
Is there ANYTHING that the democrats are on the right side of? / []
This needs to be viewed by every American. God bless Elon and his team. Incredible. / []
The Devil is working hard for good to fail. / []
Is the reason Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer haven't retired yet is because their paperwork is lost in the mine? Or did they just not go to the training? / []
These seems too honest about what they doing. / []
Mainstream media’s biggest takeaway: there were mostly white men / []
Almost all gov agencies depend on the goodwill of the public.  People years ago paid their taxes to the IRS believing they were doing the right thing. / []
get on the Defense Department .... / []
So what is people benefit in this ? / []
A good man ? omg Elon open you're eyes. / []
Ty DOGE / []
The Swamp is very deep ? How could this have Happened to America? Go fourth with The Eagles Eye ...Truth Liberty And The pursuit of Justice. 🫒🕊️♥️🇺🇲🗽⚖️. America will sink if Evil is not REMOVED. Amour up !❤ Ephesians 6😘  Personally in the future , I choose too speak with human beings .❤ / []
So this is what a panel of geniuses look like. Wow. I am so proud to be an American today! ❤ / []
17:00 some redundancy in the government has its benefits. Just because there seems to be duplicate efforts, that doesnt mean its wasteful. Accountability between seemingly duplicative efforts/offices can be a good thing / []
Thank you I’m glad I watched / []
Wow! How can you be against DOGE? / []
They’re incompetent!!! / ['Says the CEO, CFO, inventor of what exactly?']
Thank you Elon and the doge team if I had the money I would buy a Tesla tomorrow / []
What about the little amount of cash I have in the bank and some I’m sitting on? Will I get a = amount back if the system fails 🤷‍♂️ / []
Sounds like a great team of especially gifted men who care about our country's future, and "we the people." / []
No Wonder Dems are mad. These dudes just might be successful 💪🏼🇺🇸 / []
I get the impression that not only the success of this but the stunning amount of opposition to it from the left is going to set up the right to dominate federal politics for at least a decade if it achieves even half of its goals / []
Please vote for Brad in Wisconsin / []
Bunch of fake comments 🤣 / []
Thank you Brett  this is an outstanding interview!!!! / []
Thank you Elon and doge team. The fact that the government has no pay code to track spending.  Except for the corrupt members of the government, the rest of the country is thrilled. If you’re against exposing the corruption then you are part of the corruption . / []
Keep going doge 💪 / []
DRUMPF makes me feel smart!🇨🇦 / []
Elon Musk is the whitest person in the world, with a new estimated net worth of three dollars. / []
Doge cured my ED! Now that's hard to beat. / []
5:06 congress is in the loop right?  I mean it's not like you're cutting programs you have no constitutional authority to interfere with of course. That'd be just illegal so please just reassure our viewers that's not happening if you would.... / []
As an engineer this is sweet music to my ears to hear / []
The crooks taking US tax payers money are desperate and upset at being exposed. / []
Thanks two TRUMP @ELION 👍 / []
Democrat bulls%hit As always  They don't want America to be better! / []
Elon Musk is doing a great job 👍👍 / []
One of the most important interviews of our lives ladies and gentleman. This will go down in history. / []
This such bullsh&t. To "digitize" records you either have to physically type the information into a 'browser' or feed the paperwork (page by page) into an OCR device (Optical Character Reader). It takes time and physical labot, thousands of hours and people. There is no magical shortcut. Elon and his minion are lying throught their teeth. In the meantime, they are spending more money on their vain efforts thatn will supposedly be saved.  Idiots. / []
How does anyone have a problem with what he is doing?!? Like seriously / []
This will go down in history as one of the most eye opening occurrences of government corruption ever. People will look back and say how the hell could anyone be against men of honor like these?? Putting country before themselves. Truly a shining example of amazing patriotism / []
All-star cast / []
Elon loves this country more than many of the  democratic congress who all took an oath! / []
Why?? Would anyone have. A problem cutting waste? / []
Maybe it’s a way to get all info under one roof. Complete control / []
Elon will be president on day watch / []
Federal going to be rich and states going to be poor. Good job Elan to make the states poor. / []
Love this, and Elon’s dream team.   Everyone needs to share this with their friends! Thank you Doge team!🇺🇸 / []
Good luck, America, if you even remotely believe this BS is true... but I'm not surprised that you can't anymore. Your government had to abandon all decency and integrity before they could kiss Trump's a... What is really true is that the best liars in the world sit in Trump's government. Perception is guided by personal needs, and when things seem too complicated, simple solutions in plain language are welcome. Trump says he likes the uneducated. That's because where the sun of knowledge is low, orange dwarfs cast wide shadows... You'll pay dearly for that. / []
Except the weather modification departments, the NOAA NWS offices shouldn't be closed. / []
It should be a doge team in every state....who's with me? ❤ / []
Elon there jealous they wish they had billions and had whatever they want / []
These guys are lying to your face and y’all eat it up just because lol, they’re trying to privatize everything so that they can line up their pockets, meanwhile the working class suffers / ['What have you accomplished in life? All those guys own businesses']
Wow. / []
Leftists: "I dont like Elon or what hes doing"  Me: " what cut specifically is he making that you don't agree with?"   Leftist:.....................crickets................. / ['Are they will just lie and say that he is “stealing social security and Medicare.”']
The left can just keep filling their diapers, Im glad we finally have a group of intelligent people working on the enormous spending waste in our country and this team needs to focus on the blue collar working class because we are getting humped in taxes! The $450.00 in taxes robbed from me every paycheck could be used for the betterment of my life not the government. / []
I want to be fully retired after 43 years in one job a😢29 years volunteering in another 🤷‍♂️ / []
Disagree. If a person's age is wrong in any database, it could also be a birth year typo. I guess they will find out when the checks stop coming and holler about it... / []
If the computers all talk to each other, you might compromise all of them as well rather than run some separately. These guys blow up rockets and call it mistakes. You cant play  and gamble with SSI the same way. / []
Go back to Africa. / []
The Democrats fix things by continuing to dump money into the abyss, and never take accountability!  This is like they continue to feed their base, the world's left idiocy! / []
I want to talk to the IT guy in the corner lol / []
Excellent! Thank goodness for DOGE. / []
More should see this. Thanks. / []
I was a contractor working a contract to aid in transitioning a part of the government over to a modern, more efficient data system, however was issued a work stoppage a month ago indirectly because of DOGE.  The government officials in charge of approving yearly options on the contract 'left' the government for early retirement per DOGE's warning, leaving no one in charge of the contract.  So myself, and our entire contract team were left unemployed over night.  No warning.  Nothing.    I love what DOGE is doing, but it is impacting a lot of good people and efforts as well. / []
DOGE = GENUIS. Thank God this long-overdue organization is taking place. It's for the good of all. / []
Keep going down the rabbit hole and find all the EVILNESS. / []
If he’s Soooo Transparent with congress, why doesn’t he ever appear before them? waiting to see how he defends his claims against them. That would be very interesting. / ['What claims']
Kudos to Elon Musk and the DOGE Team. ♥️🤍💙 / []
Thank you for looking  into SSI it's my only pension.  I was forced  into it in the 1060's.😊 / []
Thank you, gentlemen! / []
I don't  know  you Elon,  but  I love you and your heart / []
Elon didn’t have to do any of this…he is taking bullets at great expense to his businesses, but will not be given apologies after he fixes the course of America.  This is among the most noblest deeds in human history given what he is risking… / []
Thank you, great men! / []
Excellent interview and discussions. I had to search for this on YouTube. / []
Thank you! / []
All lies just want money / []
Fantastic interview. SHOW ALL THE PEOPLE / []
Jesus Elon is so unlikable…how was he ever popular? / []
Does anyone else feel this is all because of using computers? / ['Actually the opposite, it was the lack of computers. Computers would create accountability, which is what the scammers do not want.']
I will pray for you guys especially Elon Musk and President Trump and his cabinet. God bless, guide and keep you all safe.🙏 / []
PLEASE COME TO AUSTRALIA WE NEED YOUR HELP ELON! / []
So very grateful for Elon and the Doge team! / []
Thank you! Elon Musk / []
Thanks DOGE team and mr president Trump😅 / []
Love you Elon! / []
Thank you ELON and all the other employees at DOGE. I believe as you do, this is our 2nd Revolution. My father always told me that it was up to “the citizens” to question the government if it stops working for us. Americans are getting poorer and politicians/bureaucrats are getting richer. It’s time for a fiscal accountability revolution. I’m proud to be a witness of this. Anyone opposed is guilty by association in my eyes. Thank you DOGE, you are patriots and we owe our countries survival to those on this panel. There are still good people out there that are brave and diligent like you.  ❤️🇺🇸💪🏻🚀 / []
Elon is right who ever make a lot of noise that is the one who benefits for this corruption, really doesn't make sense 4.6 millions credid card for the 2.3 millions federal employees, that why we have huge debt. / []
Thank God, for men of integrity and diligence,  who care about our children and their future. / []
The evil could be shut down if the FCC would enforce the standards and rules of Broadcasting.   Those who promote Hate, Racism and Violence should be held accountable for what is broadcast on their networks. / []
I VOTED FOR THIS!!!!!!! 😊 / []
Elon says you busted fools no more! After found im out peace!!!!!!!!😂😂❤❤ / []
The idea of saying since 2008, is to pin it to the Obama admin....how convenient, politics, politics lol. These guys are all crookz / ['Oh, you poor thing. You think Obama was your Savior. You are in for a rude awakening.']
Well played Elon Musk! Your modern-day smoke and mirror game is strong. / []
Great interview and discussion. Giving some very enlightening responses. / []
So this is the Oligarchy the left is crying about? / []
5 years from now the US in a great depression with no allies / ['if the nation is being managed by morons like you.. good thing theyre not']
Why stop at 15% though? / []
Source: trust me bro / []
If these same guys did the same interview on CNN, all they would be doing is calling the DOGE people names / []
Anyway you can extend more then 130 days ?? / []
I hope Elon is reinvigorated by the support he's shown here. The negativity and nonsense has to get him down a little. / []
So where's the proof? / []
It absolutely blows my mind that this is not a bipartisan situation! This is a perfect example of how demented and hell-bent on power the Democrats are! Every single American needs to watch this!! / []
GO ELON MUSK and the DOGE TEAM! I don't care what democrats and Jasmine Crockett think of you, YOU ROCK BRO! Happy birthday Jasmine. / []
Looks like Bret hit the ski slopes before this interview, if you know what i mean / []
What goes around comes around / []
Honestly tho America needs un update = DOGDE 🦾🦾 / []
You're just destroying lives, you impractical dummy / ['if the people viewing are no brainer like you..  you bitter .. coz your Biden could not do it ..all he knows is getting cash from govt to his family pocket']
Great Job Elon and the DOGE Team! Thank You! / []
Great job Bret / []
Please keep up the prayers for Elon and his family and all working with DOGE.  We are being blessed greatly by the exposure of the robbers. / []
This should be required viewing for all humanity. / []
Whats mind blowing is the fact a woman wants to breed with you. You big weirdo / []
Doge hype!  gg boys  / []
Incredibly informative interview. This work is super necessary. / []
Hahaha, you're so dumb Elon. You dont make any sense / []
The average democrat is completely nuts and exists in their own make believe world.  Common sense is finally becoming popular again and that’s why the term “democrat” is becoming a bad word.  Reagan was able to achieve the same when it came to “liberal”.  Ahhh gotta love history repeating itself / []
Fantastic. I don’t use that loosely / []
All these men are Heroes to 175 million Americans!!!❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
“Musk is a cologne that always smelled ….” 👩🏼‍🚀🇺🇸👽🧑🏻‍🦯‍➡️ / []
Honestly name me just ONE time that you saw this level of transparency and articulate individuals explaining in detail the problems they are encountering and how they are going to fix it. this has NEVER been seen.  Coming from an old bernie sanders supporter.  not anymore of course / []
Please don't stop!!! / []
I as an, American Woman love everything you are doing / []
Amazing work is being done by DOGE! Why aren't all of the news channels posting this?? I'm sharing with everyone I know. / []
Everything else I love it… I support dodge / []
The reason of the retirement process is because by hand is the most secure. Time & time has proof anything digital is everything but secure. Bye bye to our secrets. Smh / []
Get rid of IRS !! / []
Thank you / []
where are the fraudsters that have actually received money / []
👏👏👏🇺🇸✊️ / []
Outstanding. What a team, and what good work! / []
Real American heroes / []
If the tap leaks, should it be fixed at the earliest or would it be better to wait until it floods the basement? As simple as that.  The human brain has a tendency of being reluctant to unfamiliar territory (new habits are difficult to form, unfamiliar systems are viewed with skepticism ). —— “Though this be madness, yet there is method in it  —— William Shakespeare” / []
seeing a lot of database cleanup; not seeing support for how this translates to actual dollars / []
Right on D.O.G.E!🎉 / []
Saving America should not be attributed to a president, a political party, or even an ideology. It is the duty and responsibility of every American. Hopefully, one day, we will all come together toward this common goal. / []
I love the amount of critic questions! / []
Excellent interview Brett…nice to hear the TRUTH! / []
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 / []
These are some of the smartest people in the world they were talking so casually and Bret could barely keep up. / []
Looking forward to seeing what’ the government looks 2 years from now / []
Thank you all!!! / []
Bet corporate media will never air this. / []
God bless everyone in that group. I don’t understand how anyone can be ok with the federal government not being able to pass an audit / []
This was awesome to watch! / []
Time is the ultimate measure of all things, and I have no doubt that these individuals will be remembered in history as the saviors who prevented America's bankruptcy. I'm grateful to witness history in the making / []
Defund PBS.! / []
You can only be against this if you are on the kickback list. / []
Billionaires?? / []
It’s getting real.👏 / []
Thank you so much to Bret for shining the real light on what these men are accomplishing on behalf of the American people. True Humanitarians! Greatly appreciated! / ["These guys are real American Hero's \r\nwithout the Hollywood costumes.", 'Do not generally trust Bret BARE.']
Sic 'em Elon!  Sic 'em Donny!  Sic 'em DOGE!  I don't dare run my own house the way the government runs the country's finances. VERY smart people are fixing this. / []
Great inputs from team to understand what DOGE is doing / []
These men are digging out the deep state! / []
This should be REQUIRED viewing for anybody AFRAID of DOGE or the mission of DOGE. / []
They will succeed and when they do I officially propose a Mt. Rushmore esqe monument to these men! / []
Thank you, Elon, for working to save the country.  Keep up the fight, fight, fight against the evil!! / []
God empower Mr Elon Musk and and his great team. God proper all your efforts in Jesus mighty name Amen and Amen 🙏🏆. / []
all these guys networks will he tripple buy the time there done / []
if you drain the swamp,the frogs will scream🐸🐸🐸 / []
Elon musk is a good dude. / []
just amazing, team work makes the dream work. / []
Big pharma?? / []
Mr. Amazing!  Thank you ELON! / ['Hey old boomer lady:  don’t you  get bored watching Fox all day long on YT or on cable .. I bet you still have cable 😅\n\nSo you going to join Musk’s new party? Are do you stay true to your cult leader Trump? Yes you’re ignorant and in a cult. \nWhy? You don’t disagree with anything Trump MAGA does  • everything is the Democrat’s fault • and you sit here all day commenting on all these vids. \n\nI’m a democrat and when Biden was president I thought he messed up a lot. Plus I went to H.S. (did you) and university of course .. but in H.S. you’re taught Civics. Civics is where they teach you how the US gov functions and based on all your comments .. you don’t know. \n\nIt’s not too late to learn. Or stick with Fox Trump MAGA and blaming the Dem for everything. Stay in your cult because it makes you happy.']
Outstanding interview. Everyone should listen to this. / []
Oil research incentives?? / []
Oil research incentives?? / []
This is every auditors dream to be able to be part of this team! / []
WhTs with  "and thanks to President trump " sounds  scripted coupled with elon nodding / []
The military?? / []
Their mission is to save  trillions dollar . So, where the money go ?? Are they will go back to the american ?? Are those budget cut will make american better or worse ?? Thousand of people lost their job , american still pay the same tax , the american will pay for tariff war , So they save trillions for what ?? For them or for the people ?? / []
Excellent interview / []
Kids don’t have a father, parents don’t have a son and for what? God bless Elon Musk. / []
THIS IS AMAZING!! A ONCE IN A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT!! And yet the other side of the isle condemns every aspect of it.  The ones screaming the loudest have everything to hide!! / []
God bless the entire President Trump Administration!! Thank you for cleaning up our government!! / []
Is Steve Davis stoned? Look at his bloodshot eyes 👀 / []
I am not fan of this guy but we need to learn from everyone, if we hate because we don’t like the person is totally wrong, woke up people and let’s try to do things to make sense / []
If the glove don't fit.  You have to throw out. / []
thanks for contributing to the downfall of the US empire, Elon Musk. / ['Once in a lifetime opportunity!!']
Make it efficient yes But double ✔️ ✅️ check Because you are not making sacrifices  Make sure the poor and not included are taken care of please / []
This is my third time watching this. Elon would you please clarify or elaborate on your receiving 8 million a day in government contracts? / []
Incredible work these guys are doing. Long overdue. / []
Do Democrats understand how expensive it would be to do the kind of work that DOGE is doing?  These type of services and system upgrades would cost hundreds of billions of dollars.... especially at the speed which they are executing. / []
Great job, Bret!  Great to 'meet' the folks running DOGE, impressive group.  Thanks! / []
The GOP legislators totally support trump's thoughtless, irresponsible, draconian spending cuts, except those in their state! / []
Just 👏 brilliant!  My mind boggled at the amount of brain cells in just one room! These men are serious fixers! 😃. / []
Sounds like bollocks to me / []
Its about time we voted in people to do the right thing!!!! ❤❤❤ / ['Yep! That’s why I voted for Elon Musk and not Kamala!']
35:51 Those lies almost got the President killed, and did get killed one of his battle buddies at that Rally in Pennsylvania. / []
To the DOGE Team members,  thank you for your sacrifice. From a greatful nation. / []
Mad love and respect to Elon and entire team. We’re with you! / []
Where did you find these underdeveloped idiots like musk,vanse,rubio, troomp,? / []
alright everyone, mark "mass bot glazing" on your bingo cards / []
how dare the government waste trillions of our money that we have to work so hard for !!!!  and then to threaten to end social security in 2033!!!! how dare you let the country go bankrupt . not only was the Democratic government negligent but they are completely incompetent to run our government !!! thank God for president Trump and Elon Musk and the dogs team !!!! / ['DOGE team', 'Musk said social security is a ponzu scheme and that he wants it eliminated. Musk.']
“There’s no report — we just cut 4 billion a day, 7 days of waste a week.” – Elon  That’s the difference between a builder and a bureaucrat. The government cranks out reports and talks in circles. Elon Musk skips the paperwork and moves the world forward—daily. / []
This will help us secure America's future. / []
How you cannot love Fox News, Musk and the doge team??! / []
Love you DOGE love you ELON.. FROM EUROPE / []
If what ur saying is true then go infront of the congress like every other elected cabinet member has to do. Show the congress and show them all ur proof_ and criticism will stop! U won’t cause u can’t show proof of anything u are saying! / ['But it’s on their website 😩😩']
Hmmm. Kinda knew all this. / []
We never saw those clown behaviour under president joe Biden as he hired professional mature experience qualified staff in every positions of the White House  No 4 years old boy was get in the car with a president  or play in the presidency  oval with his father dress casually pick his nose and sleep in the White House father and son Fire people 🤮 👎👎👎🇺🇸👎 / []
Are the Gov database using MS SQL lol or DBase 1 back in 1993? / []
And no taxes on benefits!!! / []
Glad to see this interview has over 3 million views looking forward to it getting 30 million! / []
Why this isnt in every channel . / []
Only 1 trillion? / []
❤❤❤ / []
It really should be called embezzlement / []
Amazing. Finally a team with brains. / []
God bless America 🇺🇲 / []
Bit harsh there at the end elon / []
When will the $2 trillion in promised cuts be completed? / ['😂😂']
America LOVES Elon & his posse xcept the ho’s on the view & democrats & WHY aren’t they happy we’re finding all this money? bc follow the money & it’s all going to dems!! / []
"the one's providing the money and pushing the propaganda, we're going to go after them"........ maybe for once someone will explicitly name them / ['They don’t exist😂']
GREAT JOB DOGE! / []
My favorite part was when Musk vowed to go after the media mongrels who are LYING about what they're doing. NYT, WaPo etc apparently have a stake in the grift. Musk even said that the people who are targeting Teslas are less to blame than the media that put them up to it. / ['Musk is to blame- he/tesla were beloved by left before he went on fox and said social security was “the big one to eliminate”']
This is a duty for our children’s future! / []
thank you all for your tireless efforts and tolerance of the public hate and violence. be safe. / []
Thank you DOGE for all of your hard work and sacrifice! / []
THANK YOU DOGE / []
It’s good someone in a government somewhere is looking after all the taxpayer funds wasted. Come over to Australia guys and sort out the fools here please!! / []
I see a new Chevy in the future. Yay! / []
MSDNC, cnn, abc, cbs, nY times, all the leftist news papers won’t broadcast this. Why? Government is their religion / []
Which one of his minion's is Big Balls? / []
God bless Elon Musk!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
36:51 and? Actions speak louder than titles bubba. / []
God bless all the men and women who are working on DOGE! Thank you all! / []
The money flow will stop the day yes voters on the wars require the yes vote voters to send their own families to the front / []
All patriots! / []
You guys are literally M.aking.A.G.A. 🇺🇲🇺🇲 / []
Adam Shift definitely isn’t helping anything , he is just creating hysteria and hate against people who are trying to create a decent place for us to live regardless of party or religion or race or anything so we can raise family’s and be productive and have a level playing field  and a safe place to do it with jobs that are fulfilling to us. / []
very enligtning and even strangely inspiring / []
👌💪💪💪 / []
I think the politicians on the left using false information and incendiary language should be held accountable. / []
15:28 I hope Mr. Musk is also including how to manage if the systems, after being made efficient technically, can still survive electromagnetic damage and whatever forces could shut down the electricity grid or damage computer networks. / []
I learned a lot, keep sharing with what is happening, have to educate us on this. So thankful we have you, Elon Musk & Doge team! Thank you. ❤ / []
Considering majority of media will block this truth just share the link to people you know and do your part. / []
RIGHT ON THIS IS WHAT AMERICANS VITED FOR AND MORE..! / []
Are these people being paid? / []
Wheres the guy who said he was racist before it was cool 😂😂😂😂 Revenge of the nerds vibes / []
I love Elon!!!! / []
The taxpayers want accountability. Doge is the solution.  All those that are getting in the way need to be stopped.  If the Dems are in the way, please vote them out of office in 2026.  If Doge is not allowed to do its work, all those entitlements like Medicare and Social Security will be gone for the next generation. / []
Thanks 😊 / []
God bless these people / []
God bless you men, U r saving our country! / []
12:30 It would be nice for them to dump some names of these individuals, that would be easy to verify. Not doxx them but just gives us some names. / []
Amazing work doge is conducting. The method of delivery and communication is not sitting well with wonkiest lesftists.  If we don’t fix corruption American will sink more into debt. / []
Call Congress.- Let them know about how pleased-America is with these brilliant men and this impossible task, ( becoming possible in-front of our eyes).- and finally:  REPOST. 🌱🫡 / []
I'll take videos you wont see on The View, CNN, MSNBC, Colbert, Kimmel for 500 Alex! / []
What is happening to the fraudsters?  Would love a report on the arrests records and beyond. / []
Wow, what you said, Elon, in the interview alone with Brett, was spot on!  Thank you! / []
God bless him and the US government for leading and enlightening the country. / []
Who's afraid of an audit?  Somebody or entity with something to hide. / []
7:20 I think these guys and gals should develop some sort of AI system for businesses that is free and which advises all levels of business people on the various laws from city to federal that they have to contend with regarding their particular business.  The AI will advise to help owners and management comply and navigate through all the levels of bureaucracy vertically and horizontally. / ['Interesting!.  I think this is the first time we have the luxury to have our government machine overhauled and it will be set up with a state of the art computer capability like a fortune 500 enterprise.  But remember we want a lean red tape and less government. 🌱']
My prayers everyday is that God would open everyone eyes to see the good things Elon and his Doge team are doing, to put USA back on track, and people should stop going against Tesla! Tesla has done nothing wrong. No one would try that with BYD. Or Mercedes Benz.  But as Elon said it’s an unfortunate!!!😢 / []
Praying for God's will in this clean up of fraudulent theft.  Praise God for what he is doing in America's future . / []
The biggest fraudster ever is sitting right there talking about dismantling the federal government as if he is the most rational and reasonable dude on earth.  He is the richest man in the world because the government bailed him out.  He is actually the richest welfare queen ever. / []
Unreal government blunders / []
I work for an agency. Our IT is a f-ing joke. Nothing talks. A single system for each task. I have to log into 6 system to go on mandatory travel. It takes 5 people to process my request. / []
Elon musk is not even american!!  deport this immigrant to his country / []
Elon very proud of you thank you! Lil pinch on da butt for that / []
Patriots 🇺🇸 / []
22:00 cant blame biden? It was there in trumps first term first time round and before that.  I hate the bias crap even you just came out blaming biden sounding like the demacratic party and media. Its just silly.   Great doing your jon but stop the bloody blame game and u too trump move on blaming biden its painfull to hear all the time.  Stop dividing people. Both of ye. Grow up / []
Loved this. Thank you for doing this. / []
This interview needs to have widespread coverage. Every American should hear what these patriotic men are doing. The people who really need to hear it are not tuning into FOX. Thank you Elon and your incredible team. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
If those checks are going into the Bank.   They have an address.  You need to go to their   address and find out who is collecting checks at   this addresses. And have them investigated.  He is cutting the people off who is supposed to   be over 100 yrs old & go check to see who they are. Get them to talk!   Who signed them up?  When you catch them they will tell you their connection within the system.   This is what they are doing in welfare as well. / []
Elon musk demanding the future look back and verify that he was right is hilarious. I can't wait to see how much good these people do for our great country❤ / []
Ok, all that's great, but we need "equal representation"...   There's too many "white men" on this team, there needs to be some people of color, women, and more from the alphabet crew.   I don't see one guy in a dress, or one woman with a deep voice and a mustache. (Which is obviously more important than saving a trillion dollars) I mean come on, right everyone? Saving money just doesn't feel the same unless it's done by people I identify with. You know, like a "California fire department" or a "jaguar commercial"... When will they learn? Fire them all and start over with a new team, we don't want the money back from "people of privilege". / []
No mystery just good sense ! / []
6:18 Hypothetically, one might say Elon Musk and all of these genius and generous people are “wasteful” spending, since by capitalist principles they are not fully engaged in leading their successful businesses or pursuits.  They are “loving” Americans and the ideals of the United States and trading their talents, time and treasures for patriotism.  It’s an excellent example of enduring opportunity costs for potential success in a future USA with hope in Jesus Christ. / []
Hero’s, plain and simple. Watch out any liberals that you are not pawns of all the wolves in sheep’s clothing losing their ability to use the government to line their pockets.

Why haven't they fired 50% of the Federal Government (excluding the US military)!?? / ["They weren't fired coz they were given early retirement options, early retirement, severance pay, opportunities for them to leave for other jobs in the private sector.

I was hoping Big Balls would be there. Wonder what these men's nicknames are?   And I would like a democrat to give a good reason for not supporting DOGE. (That is rhetorical no doubt.

Musk should take these answers to The Daily Show.  Ask Jon Stewart to condemn the violence against Tesla.  Musk and Trump aren’t very good at imaging.  I think if Musk wanted to, he could regain respect from liberals. The way to make America Great Again is an UNITED States. / []

There is so much work to actually be done, real issues, real problems to be resolved. Instead of putting in a good faith effort, we get these lying, ignorant grifters making stuff up. We are in very serious trouble. We survived two world wars and the civil war, I’m not sure our society will survive trump. / []
The fact that you believe the current administration with all the corruption that it’s actively pursuing (and silencing), versus the many years of administrations that if anything provided an overall prosperous and democratic nation is astounding. The lack of critical thinking and education (just civic knowledge) is pretty concerning. Seek out other news sources…outside of Fox and rando podcasts. This is faulty and very curated information that does not provide the full picture. This is what is done to influence and control public perception - cast doubt, deny wrong doing/accountability, and lie. / []
I thought "big balls" was in charge of everything not all these highly accomplished, brainiac's who are seriously successful in their own right. / []
My point is when are they going to arrest and prosecute the people involved in this? Is no one held responsible or what? / []
Leftists are pissed because the corrupt system these Men are exposing and correcting have been Lining Their Pockets. Let that sink in. Elite Leftists developed this corrupt system intentionally. This is certainly not all Democrats. In fact, most do not benefit. But, some benefit hugely. / []
I am so glad that Elon Musk did this interview so that the American people who voted for Trump can actually see who is behind the team that is helping America become debt free.  I remember that silly woman(for lack of MORE disrespectful words🤬)Jasmine Crockett saying that these were all "young techie guys!"  It turns out that these are grown men who are billionaires with businesses of their own and families that are helping Elon figure out how this Administration can save the taxpayers dollars! How disrespectful of the left to insinuate that these billionaires are trying to steal money from the American people! This interview further solidifies why I voted for Donald Trump❤🤍💙🇺🇸✊🏽 and his policies!  Who would not be on board with this is my question? I think I agree with Elon Musk when he said the ones that are not on board are the fraudsters!😤 / []

Great interview! All patriots love and care for the Country and are willing to sacrifice.  I just wish they could explain why DOGE is effective than all past government own audit and inspectors—it’s because of algorithms (better technology) as Speaker Johnson alluded, or something else? / []

Musk on Mark  Kelly.  What we need to understand is that the U.S. has a Constitution.  It has one because the Founders knew that no man is ever to be trusted.  As George Washington said, "Never trust the government."  Honor is to be given where honor is due.  That does not mean any man is to be believed or setup as an untouchable elite by virtue of any vocation, work, awards or service he or she has done.  Everything must come into question and if it is wrong, then what Mr. Musk wrote applies. / []

Big thanks and support / []
Fantastic interview! / []
It happened to me during COVID they stole my identity and received monthly checks for at least 2 years and I worked during Covid cause I was part of essential worker group / []
The leftists will start targeting these guys now that they've made themselves public. I pray that they remain safe while making America better. / []
Sobering  God bless  🇺🇸 🙏 / []
I am 50 & can remember since the Reagan years, politician promising to cut government waste. Now we have DOGE doing it, yet democrats being are against it??? Cut departments that show negative outcomes, Department of Education or Post Office!! / []
Chefs kiss interview / []
Zero fact checking / []
D.O.G.E..DAMM OUTSTANDING WORK!! / []
Where’s all the young people that they were talking about as part of doge? / ['Did not want to have them around to embarrass Musk. Those kids are just props.']
4:53 Friday March 28.  Thank You DOGE for trying to save our country !!!!!!!! Prayers are with you ! / []
Elon and Trump are the best team the US could ever have / ["Can't wait to read more about their adventures in the new issue of D.O.G.E. vs the Social Security Recipient!"]
Thank you God for Elon Musk and president Trump, keep them safe in your care and bless the work they are doing we pray. / []
This clown is talking sba and doesn't know that it is a survivor benefit  annuity and not small business administration.  Sad / []
I only worked for the IRS for 6 months, and the Census Bureau for about 4 months. None of this is surprising to me.   I tried to make effective changes - I got reprimanded and my employee review reflected it.   Try to make it better, your career is negatively affected. / []
these men must be protected at all cost… / []
Most Essential Group of the Dream Team. KEEP UP GOOD WORK🎉❤🎉 / []
A Traitor is a Traitor when they don't support their own Country. We have so many Traitors in our Government from top to bottom / []
FLOOD WITH SIMPLE POINTS OF YOUR SAVINGS EFFORT!! FORCT IT APPEAR EVERYWHERE!! THEY CANT COMPREHEND CONTENT THIS LONG!! / []
Musk tells Baier why they are doing this ("to save the country from going bankrupt"), Baier's next question is "Why are you doing this?"  This guy isn't listening. / []
The Real Aveangers 27:50 😊 Cleaning the house,  step aside pls... / []
Elon and team should be receiving big thank you's. I'm very grateful.  I don't think they are doing it for applause.  They knew the democrats would incite the crazies OR would cause ngos to fund violence,  protests. Destroying property is the same as theft / []
Liars will always lie. As a government employee we has to pass audits and have. The only agency that doesn't is the dod. There are strict regulations on what  and how we buy things.   They are talking aboutno oversight, you just fired the OIG. Disingenuous liars. Everything is in UFMS we barely use paper. / []
May our amazing and benevolent Lord bless these amazing people for helping all of us at the detriment to themselves / []
When this team is done in the USA can they come sort out South Africa next?! / []
What DOGE are doing is so inspiring... praying other countries will step up too and have their own DOGE. May GOD protect this guys and their families.... / []
Government and Media should not be able to push propaganda in the American People 😡😡😡😡 reverse the Obama Law of Propaganda / []
Lord protect these men  ✝️🙏🏼 / []
Elon is a hero / []
I have worked for the government and they are truly doing things like the 80s all day! Its needed upgraded for many years now. / []
Meanwhile liberals call them thieves and claim there's no proof they're finding anything / []
We LOVE.... LOVE you Elon!! Thank you for everything . I'm so grateful that you and your team are taking care of my future and my sons future! I'm so sorry that you have to go through all the ish you're going through w/ the left! But Im sure what goes around , comes around.  Keep taking care of us! / []
Why is our taxes so high if there's so much extra cash? And so much you can take it from the stock market. / []
The Pentagon is full of corruption just like the Congress and Senate, / []
What a softball joke of an interview. “We have to do this or the gov will be insolvent.” -Then why are you cutting taxes, instead of raising taxes for billionaires (YOU?) You have shown countless errors in your wall of receipts and you’re now hiding the code to trace those receipts. - Is that transparency? Why is Elon more qualified than congress to determine who, and which gov agencies get cut? Since you’re gaining more gov contracts (FAA) - isn’t that the definition of corruption? If you’re doing such a great job, THEN WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE YOU!!?????…. I have so many more questions. / []
Hey ELON THEY STILL CANT HEAR YOU!! .. your time is short!! .. make a simple CHART!! SIMPLE MESSAGE!! AND FLOOD IT TO PUBLIC!! FORCE THEM TO APPEAR EVERYWHERE!! It’s the truth anyway! / []
Elon looks less at ease then before / []
And also the team of Elon Musk I would also expect you to work out returning the wealth you have been stealing from other countries, which America continues to enclose in their GDP via extensively present network of money laundering as part of their business players of which we have not heard yet nothing. Yes I would be enclosing the situation of former Yugoslavia that continues to be used as some kind of basin for Americans where they can go whenever they want and take whatever they want from there including very large amount of money. Here I would increase the list with Western alliance. Can Elon Musk tell us something about that as well? Thank you / []
For what? So people like Elon can express their views openly. For the War to stop, Russia needs to stop. Ask Putin FOR WHAT, not the Ukrainians. / []
elons done a mans work ... (blade runner reference) / []
You know what absolutely galls me, is that the federal government imposes insane levels of regulatory compliance on the financial sector, and by their own rules the federal government should been long ago shut down and taken over by the FTC and given to chase bank for a song. / []
Great report. Flood the Democratic party with this info. Maybe the judges would get off DOGE if they knew the good DOGE was doing for Americans. / []
Wow 😮 the paper documents development status is high end technological innovation 🤦🏻‍♀️. High potential and room for digital innovation and transformation are given 💪🏻😉including IT infrastructure strategies update. / []
These men are patriots! / []
Thanks DOGE team for rescuing the USA, and with the ripple effect, the world will be better off too! / []
Just read on Modern Monetary Theory and you'll quickly realize this is all a scam. Reading through the comments section is demoralizing, the non-educated are truely brainwashed. / []
This video show go viral. Already over 3M views, 118K likes and 21,541 comments. Being the only member of the "Party Of Common Sense", I wish my friends and family would be open to watching this with an unbiased mind. / []
Thank you DOGE!!  I'm sharing this and praying for your family and safety!!! May Hod blade and give you wisdom.   🇺🇸MAGA.  Why would anyone be against this?! / []
You cannot trust anything the Democratic party puts out, God only knows how much elon's has helped us 😊 / []
This will go down as one of the greatest moments in American history. / []
Musk we have a 40 Trillion Dollar Deficit!! The deficit is rising $6.6 Billion dollars per day or over 16 trillion in the last decade... You have to get it down to at least to 15-20 trillion for us to be stronger or better off!! You know what would help our Deficit?? Taxing the Billionaires!! / []
There is still people that will call this fake or a lie. Unfortunately you can’t help some people. / []
The biggest problem that our country faces is that groups within our own government are working against our country, trying their best to prevent us from fixing problems and cutting unnecessary spending. / []
Elon is the man.  We need more Elons. We need one here in the UK and Europe too / []
This was a completely eye-opening interview for me at least, and here I was for the longest time a doubter, bith for their capabilities and/or their effectiveness, but holy...now I am completely on board. This needs to be aired across all television networks across the states, because everyone must see this to understand what DOGE is really doing. / []
this is the future, president elon! technocracy next / []
If some people don’t understand this I am very sorry for usas American what have our surrounding had teaching us like family, schools and colleges 😩. Elon and his people doing a great job why some people don’t want to understand because of what / ['Because of fear. \n\nLook for videos and articles about SSI, Medicare & VA being eliminated. \n\nThey have 2 things in common: \n\n* Promote fear \n* Use such words as "possibly, might be, could be" but not the finite word.']
The right wing is going to suffer the most from these frauds dismantling the sensible structures keeping the United States civilized.  This is a case of the uneducated and hateful right destroying the common sense that's keeps them alive. / ['WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY! Don’t you people get that? We can’t continue spending on all this garbage.', "@BrianMaushart\xa0 most government spending is a force multiplyer - An expense  that increases  productivity and quality of life beyond it's cost.  This is obvious and it's in every economics text.  Trump and Elon are both uneducated frauds with decades of experience  lying about critical issues.  The United States is being dismantled by stupid narcissists and the uneducated right who gleefully supports them."]
They can indeed point to things 😂 / []
I think one of the questions that everyone wants to know is why no one's being arrested and put in prison? / []
A team of great patriots! / []
So smoooth.   How is this correction taking place? Why must all these critical issues be addressed by only billionaires? Why focus on unverified "facts"? Could this be an empty promise for"better".? Or, better for whom? Why should citizens accept this sweep operation which wreaks havoc for thousands of citizens? / ['Because the government will never audit itself or constrain itself. Only grow. These men bring decades of experience in how to run an organization, and are unaffected by political bribery and coercion as they are not part of the government.']
Thank you all for your selfless gift to America, meaning all of us. I pray for your safety and continued success in all you do. As for POTUS Trump, the initiator of this necessary undertaking, if this is the ONLY thing that is accomplished in his 4 year term it will be the most monumental accomplishment this government has ever experienced. I know there will be much more but this is truly amazing. / []
Doing great work making cuts to get those tax breaks for the wealthy. If only a little came back to the working class. / []
Thank God for Elon and his amazing team. These guys don’t need to do anything but live their best lives in the rich world. They are doing this for the rest of us.  Burns me up to listen to the absolute idiot democrats rail against this. Tells me how dirty they are. / []
We need this in the UK....... Fast / []
Softball interview from Fox, with answers from untrustworthy people is not behind the scenes.  It's just another fake Fox interview   Stupidity for stupid people / ['You’re a moron. Please do not use the Internet unsupervised.']
Nzi pack / []
will doge look at the military? / []
We are supposed to give babies social security if their parents are nowhere to be seen. They’re already dealing with enough by not having mom and dads. The dad dies before the baby is born, the mom is gone because she’s not fit or dies in child birth, like what are you gonna do then just give them to foster care? How do you support them? / []
Bloke at the front left is deparate to get involved / []
. / []
Please give us a stimulus check I can invest that money and triple it / []
Every network and radio station should be required to broadcast this interview.. starting with PBS and NPR / []
This is actually comical.  So these are "the boys" or "the college kids" the left keeps referring to?  Helping  Elon rob, steal, cripple, take advantage of the US Government?  Cut our Social Security, Medicare, Medicare benefits?  I would love to see just one person from The View sit down with these "boys" for 5 minutes. / ['You’re a moron please do not use the Internet unsupervised in the future. Thank you.']
DOGE😊 thank you elon and Teammate for saving America for Americans in the future and build myself a tiny home / []
I dont think some of this information should be released to the general public where important papers are stored. / []
Hey ABC, CBS, NBC. Pick this up and air without your talking heads' blabber. / []
obvious GOP lies prove MAGA is the stupidest form of treason ever conceived. / ['HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT ? WHEN DOGE IS SHOWING HOW YOUR DEMOCRAT PARTY IS STILLING FROM ALL AMERICANS ???... WUZ UP ?  ANSWER THAT.  BUT YOUR PROBABLY NOT NUFF SAID.']
All men, that's your first problem. / []
so which one is "big balls"? / []
Ask Elon why he needed 10 million from his business associate and close friend Diddy to purchase Twitter?! / []
MAGA ALL DAY LONG / []
D.O.G.E.  IS  SAVING  AMERICA.   THANKS! GOD BLESS AMERICA FOREVER ❤️ / []
Elon and his team are amazing. Thank you so much for helping this awesome country. / []
Godspeed DOGE 🙏🇺🇸 / []
whats the point of a survey if someone else can type in someone elses info and claim to be them/fraudsters / []
Wuh? Elon promising what he cannot deliver? Then the South African immigrant goes on to disparage a soldier/astronaut/ real hero. Oh this is great. / []
The biggest value of this effort is change of culture in Washington. Basically draining the swamp / []
Elon, a Great American! We pray for you and your family! / []
Thank you DOGE Team for what you guys doing. I salute you all! 🫡🫡 / []
Bret Baier seems skeptical?  Bad Look. / []
These people have no credibility from the previous jobs they held to be charge of what gets cut. That's why even Bret who never questions Trump looks very unconvinced/just not buying all the lies coming out of their mouths. They won't testify in congress because they can't and won't prove any of the claims they're making here. What a joke this so-called team Trump assigned for a job they're obviously unqualified to do. / ['Is it physically painful to be as stupid as you are?']
CNN still hasnt asked what ice cream flavor Trump eats. / []
my next question is for Big Balls, which one of you is Big Balls... / []
What happens if someone is in the disability application process, receives provisional payments, has an upcoming appointment with the determination office to confirm mental status, and is now being threatened with letters from SSA stating they should not have received said payments and has to pay it all back…with the case still open and in process….  To add insult to injury, a new policy was just put in place that gets rid of the old 10% overpayment recoup from the checks and is now 100%.  🤔 Talk about exploitation again, Elon.  Phone lines are down, local office has zero answers…. I asked Grok and his answer carried the same sentiment as mine-Highly unusual and highly concerning…. I’m a real person and this is a real thing that is happening to people like me and people way worse off than me who don’t have the ability to speak up for themselves.    I love FOX, used to love Elon but the way this being handled so hush hush is deeply disturbing and heartbreaking for the victims of these huge changes in policy without warning.  Terrible things are happening, Elon… / ['And before someone comes at me with the whole “transparency” speech… Imagine there are things happening around you that you’re unaware of because you’re told that everything is transparent and you don’t need to ask further questions. Now imagine you are a victim in that situation and everyone around you is telling you that they are being transparent and they are helping you but you just don’t get it.']
Regrading to Elon's traitor claim, doesn't Elon let his cars be build in China, Mexico, Germany and does he have plans to build new factories in Indonesia and India? Shouldn't he build this factories in the US, as he justifies it, America first? Regarding to the statement he makes about the Ukraine, peoples are dying for their freedom, for their rights, for their country, which in my opinion is legit and a very good reason to fight. What would you do if some other country would take your land? Yeah, you know what I mean! Then he is mentioning the kids who are dying every day. Isn't that the guy who is wearing his kid on his shoulder all day long as a human shield? / []
Thank you Elon Musk and the DOGE team. God bless and keep them safe for exposing all the corrupted government wasteful spending of our tax dollars 🇺🇸 / []
Man you didn't hear a dang thing biden would do for years dude was too busy visiting little children and eating ice cream. / []
This interview is gold. It will most definitely be reflected on in future history classes. / []
Amazing / []
Thank you, Elon Musk and team!  Many, many of us are totally supportive of your efforts and very grateful for your work to save the USA and the world.  God bless you! / []
Those who have eyes to see, see. / []
Elon is a con artist!!!! / []
Amerca is so lucky having this guys god bless / []
I feel that DOGE is an inside crime group. AND Musk is implementing project 2025 for Trump because  Trump wants to hide and say he doesn't know and because he's not smart enough to carry it out himself / []
That team needs the Medal of Freedom 💯 / []
Please investigate and put people in prison for long term. Only to prevent this crap from coming back after each administration. / []
Thank you all for doing this.. I know there’s backlash with the  people that have Zero common sense but You all are making a difference.. I love that you all actually care.. / []
When will this happen also in Europe ? France, Belgium lot of public money wasted... UK started to initiate an audit to cut unecessessary costs... / []
People rewarding themselves for lifting a finger and using brain cells. Well if people don't want the government to waste money they should run it themselves!  Message received loud and clear / []
Let’s go Musk and DOGE! MAGA!!! / []
He is such a lier!!!!!!!!!!!! He's just making things up as he speaks in generalities! It's unbelievable! He is delusional, he really thinks too much of himself and is full of self righteousness and it is him who's acting out his so-called righteous indignation towards people who haven't quite "made it" as much as him, people he looks down on! It's mind blowing! / ['🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Oh bless your heart!', 'just shut up!!!!!!!']
You have to wonder why the opposition even exists on this important  work these  people are doing  to help  Americans. / []
I'm a long time Trump supporter but we should take a healthy dose of criticism and not just assume that all these tech billionaires are just doing this work with Doge out of the goodness of their heart. What's in it for them in the long game? / []
Ugh, I remember the retirement process for the Army. It SUUUUUUUCKED. And further, it's so difficult for legit SSDI claims to go through. / []
Thank you Doge!!!!❤❤❤ / []
Amazing stuff.  Finally some real transparency / []
So many bots in the comments. Yeah, we see you. / []
They should have this team in other countries. / []
Your right ! So we can see evil in 4k / []
Elon musk are the real matatan, / []
Thank you DOGE!!  I'm sharing this and praying for your family and safety!!! May Hod blade and give you wisdom.   🇺🇸MAGA. / []
All lies this is not the real or original doge team you guys sre so gallabe. This is another manipulation. / []

Wow Elon Musk is doing this out of the kindness of his heart. True angel on earth and not benefitting at all from any of this! Golly Gee / []
I will do one push up for a like / []
I watched all of that, found it helpful. / []
Why is propaganda NOT ILLEGAL 🤔 / []
Thanks Fox News for this interview! It’s sad to see Elon being tired and under pressure. Hats off to him and his DOGE team ! God bless / []
How many facelifts has that freak presenter got. Elon looks envious that he might not be a human / []
Democrats said these DOGE guys are all 19 years old and “stealing”.   It makes the mentally fragile MSNBC viewers attack Tesla vehicles. 🤡 / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team! We continue to pray for you all daily. / []
What you morons don't understand is a 4.5 trillion dollar tax cut is only going to hurt the working class. And add to the debt. You wanna cut money great, start with the Pentagon. Who says they're trying to fix the economy and trump the debt but ignores the one department that regularly fails their audits and misplaced 500 billion? That's half your job right there!!! Trump is a liar, he doesn't give two shots about the economy / []
Im glad they finally did this / []
Thank you Elon / []
Go for it! Viva la Libertad, Carajo! / []
Can you imagine how excited these guys are with the idea that they are literally part of the new founding fathers??  This team, along with Trump, the cabinet members and the senators, all working together, are an internal army of expert resources, setting a new foundation for this country.  They are putting processes in place for a successful future, making it possible for us to be able to afford to pay our own bills, and have extra to donate to legitimate foundations, helping not only domestic groups but those around the world.  We can again be the United States that the world has always loved for the reasons we should be loved.  We are Americans. / []
Thank you! Must needed interview. Our country, our people , our children! need this. Thank you to DOGE Team and especially Elon Musk. ♥ / []

When I went to a trade school. I was getting a certification in business administration.  The college had outdated system. Where we had MICROSOFT WORD 10, EXCEL, POWERPOINT 10.

Boy! When has fox gotten 3M views in one day? Bret is being a good boy…so far..😂 / []

No wonder the corrupt politicians are screaming! The DOGE Team rocks! So grateful for your service. You are literally in my prayers. / []
It’s just going to become one big blanket  And a yes  I’m sorry  That is how you committed treason to America   For a criminal who had no right to office / []
yo Elon, Im sorry man, I am so sorry dude, God bless you, You are a true hero patriot. Thank you for helping us. / []
The government is not efficient, are they also going to cut the billions in incentives the government is giving their companies? / []

Notice how all the democrats had to read off a page / []
Thank you so much for interviewing, Elon Musk and his team! This was incredibly enlightening and shocking at the same time. Thank God that they are doing this work which should’ve been done decades ago. / []
This is the most selfless, capable and patriotic team on the plant. Everyone is so outstanding and an elite in their respective field. We don’t know how fortunate we are to have them. Go DOGE !! / []

So crazy how elon gets so much hate. Everyone should agree d.o.g.e does a great job. Good to see a dedicated team surrounding him. / []
Doge is doing a great job👍 / []
Anyone who believes a word that comes from Musk's craw is an imbecile. From DOGE's violation of the Appointments Clause, to the 118 billion Musk received in free taxpayer money to build up Tesla which nearly bankrupted twice, to the claims he invented the rocket and the EV, which are lies just like his being a top ranked "video game" player when he paid people to run his accounts, to pretending he wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth, to buying an election and then expecting to be, like a robber baron, in control of the government he bought, to the screwing up his "wall of receipts" that was intentionally inaccurate and provides zero evidence as to why VA workers needed to be fired, to the Judge's that have already declared DOGE to be illegal and its firings even more so, to the minerals he ogles in Ukraine, to his utterly spurious claims about free speech when Musk is blatantly silencing people who are sick of his nonsense... will someone please get rid of this ugly laminated face motherfcker? He and Trump are the same. Both horrible liars and idiots; utterly incompetent. / []
I'm sure I'm not alone 😡when I think about the money that has been wasted for years.  Think about this, within 150 days they may be able to eliminate 1 trillion dollars in waste especially that much has been spent wastefully during the Biden years, does anyone know what the all-time US federal government debt was at the end of the Jimmy Carter administration. ?..... without looking it up my understanding has been that it was just under 1 trillion dollars at that time.  Through marriage I knew someone who worked at one of the three letter agencies, and let's just say not one of the peons, hated trump, through things this person said, it was clear for years, just keep spending money and the US government will completely collapse , did not care, let us go bankrupt, let China buy us for pennies on the dollar, I heard things like this.  Did not think that Marxism , Socialism or communism was a bad thing😂, and worked in DC.  Talk about a swamp full of ppl that hate us / []
This was one of the best YouTube videos I’ve ever seen!! Go President Trump and all your valuable team members!  🇺🇸🇮🇱 / []
This giant cave with 24 thousand cabinets stacked with papers. DOGE will digitize it in 3 days! Yessir! / []
Has Brett Baier had work done, or is that just a LOT of stage makeup? I notice from the UK, watching a lot of US News-ish/Trump footage from the Major News Networks, I have to gut the colour from 50 to 40 (where 50/100 is nominal) / []
Awesome 💯😎 / []
"Being fed propaganda by the far left!"  Excellent report and interview! / []
These men are business leaders, bright, independently wealthy, they are doing themselves no favors by getting involved here. It's just love of country and the right thing to do. / []
Is it a good idea to listen to a drug addict? Should you believe an drug addict? Where is the evidence of his claims. Don't get me wrong, I know for sure there is a lot of waste in the government, but you really need to know what you are doing. But in my opinion, this isn't the goal of this administration, it's goal is to reach a autocratic regime. Be careful, stay sharp! / []
Thank you all for your sacrifices to your own businesses and family to assist in repairing our country, making all parts of government accountable now, and in the future! / []
Doge is something that needed to be implemented a LONG time ago. Thank you Elon and team! Our children need a better system so it is there for them when they get old. / []
This is a farce and these comments are full of bots. Elon should be in prison. / ['Open your eyes. Where the F are these democratic morons getting their money? Jasmine Crockett been in public service for 5 minutes and already has 10 million in the bank on a 175k job']
This interview gives me the Wyatt Earp vibe.  As Elon in Washington, Wyatt went to Tombstone with his honorable men to straighten the town and make it a decent place for their families to live. / []
Thank you Doge Team for helping to get the government back on the right track. I hope when you get done it will stay being held accountable for our money being spent correctly and for American people first. / []
Democrats are always lying / []
Love this / []
I feel like Elon should allow the team to talk more because people dislike him & it might be better for DOGE optics.  have the team speak & than Elon speak separately rather than jumping into others speaking. / []
I'm sorry you're not a government official Elon muskrat you have no business cutting anybody from any jobs and I really hope that judges let you and Trump have it / []
This is so excellent!! Why are people mad about this !!?? Makes no sense! / []
Thank you for doing this all to save our country from the corruption that has run unchecked for far too long ❤ bless you! / []

Wow, may GOD continue to bless Doge and the entire team. / []
If you are not seeing this on your "news source" you are being lied to! / []
Should the people's right to chose to go to a medical doctor or a doctor natural path / []
Liberal here and I'll be honest it's comforting to hear all these people from doge talk about these issues in great depth. But it's also worth noting why are they only going to Fox? Are there questions they're scared to answer that possibly other networks would ask? Elon has repeatedly refused to appear before government committees and panels for questioning. Why is that? Seems to me like they're answering questions that they have already prepared to answer. / []
The real question is DOGE efficient using their chainsaw massacre approach. / []
Words can't describe how much I appreciate the way DOGE is working. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ We need this on all mainstream dinosaur networks because very necessary civilians need to hear this, and they only watch mainstream news.  Please keep up the transparency and hard honest work. Thank you, DOGE-TRUMP!!!  ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 / []

Thank you for calling out the tribal land support and the Native Tribes and true AMERICAN NATIVES who need the same protections; we all need to help and protect each other as we have become “AMERICAN.” Even more protection is needed now as you have called out the penetrations to our constitution and these fentanyl dealers.   We need more proactive policing to stop these people like “to catch a predator.” / []

I watch that! Stunning waste, waste, waste of our money. Everyone Should watch this. 😲🤔 / []
Very informative,these guys are doing a great job 👏👏👏 / []
Why is anyone against this? / []
What about the “mistakes” that become evident after their 130 days. Who’s gonna “fix” those. Consequences of changing processes, digitising services and getting rid of people aren often slower than the implementation especially in government. / []
These are the kids? / []
There you ARE!!! I KNEW THERE WERE CREDIT CARDS!!! I called it OUT HIGH CRIME HERE!! how many that are not working AND STILL BEING PAID!?? / []
Thank you Elon for risking so much for USA 🇺🇸 / []
God Bless America, God Bless the President Donald Trump, and God Bless Elon Musk❤ / []
Thank you Fox News / []
Thank you Elon and amazing Team!! / []
It's the juice / []
Which one is big balls?!? 😂😂😂 / []
The ultimate finance bro team, I love it and appreciate all their hard work 🙏 And absolutely yes we need to hold the liars accountable, the ones causing this irrationality / []
Will there be criminal repercussions for the people and companies blatantly stealing taxpayer dollars?   / []
Informative & Important / []
God bless this team / []
👍🏼🙏🏼 / []
Imagine if they released all the errors they've fixed within the government in the same way a game does "Bug Fixes" 😂😂😂 Trying to rattle through all of the errors that are now fixed would blow out mindsssss / []
THE MOST COMPELLING INTERVIEW EVER BROADCASTED / []
It's pretty obvious that the people who are critical of DOGE haven't the intelligence to see the good being done by these fine people.  Keep up the good work Elon! / []
Just a bunch of 💩 with no real facts. Just because they throw out unverified info doesn't make it necessarily true... Especiqlly for an expert liar like Musk... / []
Where are the arrests? It’s clearly money laundering. / []
No one voted for elon musk, we don't want anti Americans we only want pro Americans who aren't disrespecting America with the "special elon salute". I don't want to live in a world with anti Nato people in power. God bless America, but not extremists like them. / []
If we should put America first. Then why are we still supporting Israel? / []
God bless you Elon ❤ / []
As an american I found this humiliating. Nearly every example from Musk's lips was easily disprovable. / []
My grandfather and great grandfather etc... where all ranchers and farmers and businessmen. i was always told as a child in order for the USA to thrive you need a business man running it... not a politician. My family hates politicians because they are all about lining there pockets... not helping the American People / []
Thank you Elon and the whole DOGE team for helping us God bless you all ❤❤❤ / []
I got chills when Elon showed some real emotion over the boys on both sides dying in Ukraine. / []
WHAT A JOKE 😅😅😅😂😂😂 / []
The crooks are doing well here in Tri-Cities Washington  state. I could feel something electronic zap my fanny pack at the laundry mat a few days ago. / []
This needs to be in long form podcast. / []
They don’t show this kind of thing on other networks because they’ve made outrage their choice of ratings and pushing an agenda.  It stirs up the deranged terrorizing and what’s wrong with the model of so much media / []
This is the most greatest thing happened to the USA. I can't believe this is happening and I'm watching Fox News and like it. / []
If you gave 1 million dollars each to 1 million people, that would cost 1 trillion dollars. Thirty-seven trillion dollars could make 37 million people into millionaires. / []
American heroes! / []
This is what real superheroes look like! Thank you all! / []
Great project Great people Keep on ❤ / []
Absolutely incredible. Who would have ever thought it would be Trump & Musk saving the republic in 2025? Their sheer power of will is impressive and unmatched. Rock on guys!🤘 / []
buying Tesler stock. what a gift Elon is to the US.  I pray for him.  He is saving us / []
I'm so confused how there are people hating on what they're trying to achieve... I mean I get the part where they're scared, but is it just because of the left pushing to make them look bad? So confusedddddd / []
How can anyone get disability without going through the court system?  That doesn't make sense in my experience. / []
that was incredible!! / []
Unbelievable report…informative, examples and clear direction!!!! Well done Bret! / []
Heroes / []
This was an incredibly enlightening program! Thank you Elon Musk and your D.O.G.E. Team.  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
What is left of "the left" isn't capable of anything close to this. Objectively speaking. / []
Man / []
I admire Elon Musk and mostly agree with his reasoning, but I disagree with his stance on Ukraine. In our life there are morals and principles and when your country gets invaded without provocation the patriotic principle is to defend it.  Surely, and unfortunately, people die in wars, which makes the invader even more guilty. Claiming that people are dying for nothing is just senseless! What if USA is invaded, will nobody fight back not to cause people to die? Same case with Israel responding to Hamas attack / invasion. If USA wants to support Ukraine or not is a different issue,  but the USA is compromised because it signed as security guarantor when Ukraine surrendered its nuclear weapons. / []
Elon, we are lifting you up to God in prayer for protection and God's contd blessings. You are acting in love, integrity, peace and justly on behalf of America and we are truly grateful.  We know God has you here for such a time as this for the helping of the saving of this nation- One Nation Under God- Jeremiah 29:11/Esther 4:13/ John 3:16- thank you / []
🙏 DOGE... / []
I'm not really a fan of Musk, but this is one thing he's doing right.  While I knew the government wasted a fair bit of money, this is much worse than I expected. / []
Love this transparency!, Thanks Guys / []
I am so proud of these people! THANK YOU! / []
All these people aproven these loans should be put in jail now / []
I don’t agree with most of how DOGE is going about this but in general they are in the right direction. It’s sad but true. Just look at LA City (not even DOGE-ed yet) but the city has no track record of 1 billion dollars that went towards the Homeless program (LAHSA). In addition the discovery of a city budget shortfall has ballooned from 1b to 2b within the span of a week 😭 / []
GREAT interview! / []
Elon literally has a rich successful business men who are trying to help the country not for their own benefit but to help all Americans citizens and the generations to come / []
Can we check how much we sent to Israel / []
So much waste / []
I love you Elon!   I concur 100%! / []
Thank you for your hard work Doge.   Keep it up. We need you / []
I still do not understand the people that oppose to this !!! We should be grateful / []
What was that wailing in the background at 37:12? / []
All these years and no one knew this?  This is just unbelievable.   Thank you President Trump and DOGE for your hard work.   Keep up the good work 👏 / []
Yeah Brett, you may like the war in Ukraine to continue but most americans don't. / []
Very informative! / []
@Elon Musk and team. Thank You. 🙏 / []
Foe those DumB A$$ who hate Elon are the ones who steal SSI Money. / []
Dang. Thanks guys! / []
Awesome job gentlemen! I am a Federal retiree and I saw so much waste when u was working and bak in the early 90's I said we need a good businessman to run this country and now we have 9! It is so needed. / ['Sorry about typos, I have ALS.']
RIGHT ON ELON ..... RIGHT ON!!!!!!  Wow ... HOW CAN WE THANK THIS MAN???  And those helping. And his final words were RIGHT ON!!  Someday ... as with Ronald Regan ... Elon will have statues erected for him and the hero he has been.  History will sort this out as something that saved this country, and he gets paid NOTHING ... but instead ... just like POTUS Trump ... he is losing his hard earned ... innovative ... businesses and money.  Sick ... WE NEED TO PROSECUTE THE LIARS.  They are dangerous.  All I hear is Jan 6th. THAT WAS NOTHING compared to this!!  Thank you President Trump and Elon Musk and your team!! / []
Thank you ! / []
It’s crazy how we all know the government has been corrupt and some people believe that Elon is the villain trying to get richer off of us / []
God bless you all and thank you for all that youre doing for our country.  💪🇺🇸🇺🇸💯🙏 / []
Go DOGE GO!  Anyone screaming against this must be either mislead or is benefiting from the coruption. / []
I always said autism is actually evolution😅, getting it done 👍 / ['just in case there is any confusion, I am in full support and meant this as a compliment']
This interview should be called "This is what the Democrats are fomenting violence to stop". / []
Let's see nothing is more efficient now, it's the opposite. This idiot and his team are a bunch of clowns with no idea what anyone in the government does. Did you know he was once an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa? / []
Is he still making $8 million a day from the government? / []
DOGE represents a pivotal moment in American history. It embodies the spirit of those who strive to restore our country to its former glory. These individuals are true patriots of the USA, our modern American heroes. Viva DOGE! / []
I must add that the panel may not be representative of the population makeup, looks a little pale 🙂 / []
Finally / []
America should appreciate a South AFrican who saw what can happen to a country if left in control of leftist. Elon left South Africa just in time. Elon , you don’t owe SA anything but we ( not speaking about the corrupt government) would sincerely appreciate your help where possible. Atleast give farmers and remote citizens accessibility to starlink, like you did to Ukraine. / []
Excellent interview - much needed / []
I wish that every American would listen to this interview. Elon Musk is a hero.🇺🇸 / ['BAHAHAAHAHAAHAAHAHA', 'I’m not even American but I support Elon, bought Tesla stocks.  If America is successful, the world will be a safer place.', 'Yikes', 'So Elon Musk doesn’t want Mark Kelly to be focused on helping Ukraine, he should only be focused on America. \nSo why does he want Trump to focus on South African issues?\nElon is a lying hypocrite', 'By hero do you mean imbecile?']
Amazing! 🎉 / []
BEAUTIFUL Thanks Guys!!! ❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
DOGE, please look into Hawaii DLNR / []
THANK YOU ELON, MANY YOUNG MEN & WOMEN DYING FOR NO REASON! I FEEL YOU! THANK YOU! / []
Oh no, there are 8 white guys working together & NOT one person of color, aaaaaaargh, RUN, quickly!! / []
It's crazy to me that anyone is against this. Weird / []
Thank you Elon for having the guts to attack this monumental task. You are giving our children a chance to have a free America. / []
Elon Musk's son X is crying in the background 😢 / []
Musk with Team are glorious, glorious people. They are real American patriots. God bless them all. / []
Elon is more of a PATRIOT than most democrats. We The People appreciate all of the DOGE team for saving America 🇺🇸 / []
When local IT is needed won't they be waiting and have downtime waiting for the 2 guys issuing computers to have time to work on the issue. / []
the democrats will never understand what the people want - just listen to their interviews. So out of touch. / []
How do we get this to everyone?? The mainstream media says the opposite. / []
Thank you!!!! / []
Any chance to open source this group to other countries. We need some of that in Bulgaria/Europe / []
Musk in 2028? / []
Democrats, this is why the left and 99% of Democrats are having a fit right now because Trump is shutting off the flow of money that these people are pissing out like it’s nothing. Thank you DOGE!! / []
How can people be saying that the DOGE is doing bad things? Have those people been to the DOGE’s site? Probably the most transparent govt agency with everything they do out there! / []
If you think elons crazy you’re very silly. If anyone disagrees please make 1 valid point, I’m waiting ! / []
Where's the RICO for all these Organized Crimes / []
We need a DOGE team here in the UK / []
Winning / []
I don't know how people believe that billionaires are sifting through our personal information out of the goodness of their hearts. / ['Please, tell us what you believe.....']
It’s crazy how we all know the government has been corrupt and some people believe that Elon is the villain trying to get richer off us / ['Elon is part of the corruption… do you really think he has Americans’ best interest at heart? Why would he?']
American government dont care about our tax money!! They spend it irresponsibly like drunker sailors because its not their money and there's abundance  of money!! Unbelievable!! Dumbmocrats are so stupid to oppose the objectives of these Doge people!! These successful business people wants America to  thrive because they know that we  Americans are in in the same boat, thst if this boat sinks they also sink. / []

We LOVE YOU ELON !!! THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!!! Thank you for your SACRIFICE ❤️‍🔥🩷❤️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Incredible team, thank you for doing this interview and thank you to the DOGE team for making an effort to save our country. / []
The Future Looks Bright....Thanx to DOGE / []
God bless and protect all of you / []
The Apple store experience of government is an excellent concept. Go for it, make Americans’ life easier again and inspire the world. If the 1 billion used on national park survey was actually used on research or conservation activities, how much more lives, human or nonhumans, can be saved? Just one suggestion, do not keep 90 year olds waiting for too long, set some emergency funds aside to pay them first, particularly those who have no alternative supports. It looks like you are fundamentally transforming the way the government works. Look forward to watching the wonder rolling out in front of our eyes. / []
*DOGE being transparent and explaining their motive and findings so far*   CNN: But why are they all white men?   😂😂😂😂 / []
Thank you to everyone in and involved in doge! Thank you Elon and the rest of the people sitting on this shown stage... we would sink with out you.. / []
Great interview ! / []
Stealing social security numbers of babies?   WHO IS GONNA GET PERSECUTED? / []
The Federal Government of the United States is the largest corporation in the history of humanity and it is the most wasteful and fraudulent corporation that has ever existed. We are not only the shareholders of this corporation,  we are responsible for the repayment of its debt. The three branches of government are the C-suite and they have not run the company well.  Elon said if this was a private company, it would immediately go bankrupt and the directors would be thrown in jail. Imagine walking away from a successful business/career and volunteering to help a bunch of strangers that have no means to protect themselves. These men are altruists, not fascists. We owe them a debt of gratitude for doing what we could never do on our own. / []
One $ trillion represents $3000 per individual American or $9000 per family / []
Thank you all so much / []
Love it musk. Good job / []
Exactly! DOGE is cutting wasteful/fraudulent spending! And I don't understand why these Tesla terrorists can not understand the logic! THANK YOU ELON AND ALL THE DOGE EMPLOYEES ❤ / []
We need more people like this team. To look at government from an outside perspective (perspective of successful and brilliant business owners) willing to sacrifice their own life/profits/business for Americans. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇬🇱🇬🇱 👀 / []
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Elon is a great and passionate man who has our country’s interests at heart!!!🇺🇸🫡🙏🏽🙌🏽 / []
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Have democrats responded to this / []
😂😂😂 I love how Elon is just absolutely cucking America right now. Judging by the comment section you sick freaks enjoy it 😂😂. Varangu will always be varungu / ['What’s he doing?

No fringe on the flag! / []
HOLY CRAP!!!!! / []
Elon Musk is an American hero. These men are ensuring the future for us all. He is going to succeed! I have full faith in him as well as his team. / []
Raising the national minimum wage would boost income tax generation and move more people off of welfare programs which would do more for the government's budget than cutting essential departments. / []
Anyone against this, is either not a citizen of Usa or a part of the problem. / ["Please don't thumbs up for yourself that's embarrassing👍 MAGA"]
How can anyone be against this? / []
Where’s big balls? / []
24:19  WHY? 😅 To make sure are family gets 🎉 / []
This is a lot like a 35 year old "kid" revisiting home and discovering how elderly Mom and Dad have really been living.  lol  God bless em, but they are still rewinding their cassette tapes with a pencil and unfinished projects are all around the house. / []
Keep up the excellent work, Elon & DOGE team! We're very lucky to have you.❤ / []
God Bless President Trump and his Team / []
❤ this guy / []
Anyone who is against what these fine gentleman are doing, do not care for the greater good of your country. / []
Thank you  DOGE / []
I ONLY LISTEN TO FOX NEWS. IT IS THE MOST ACCURATE / ['I’m all for Elon and trump but you my friend are completely wrong lmao stop watching just the news, it should not be your primary source']
This information needs to be shared to all people so they know what is actually going on. Not just a bunch of Dems trying to scare everyone / []
They are a band of heroes! / []
I wish India had a Donald Trump & DOGE / []
❤ / []
Why do they all look really weird / []
❤ / []
Mark Kelly is NOT who he claims. He IS NOT Bipartisan as he claimed when soliciting his Senatorial. I am in his district!! I have written him in regards to issues that I found extremely concerning. I always received a FORM letter (exact same letter) thanking me for contacting his office. NEVER any reference to my particular concern.  He & Gallego we’re here in AZ holding a meeting. They were telling the people Elon was cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid! Also saying President Trump was acting like a 12 year old not knowing anything about running a Country other than creating Chaos!!! Kelly was also saying these things on our local TV!! Kelly had to tell everyone about his loyalty and years he served, also years in space program, etc. His greatest asset is puffing his feathers, saying look at me!! Sorry, in Michigan we always called that sort of person a “blow gut”..  Oh yes, Kelly said Elon is a liar, no way did he have to rescue the stranded astronauts. He said Elon didn’t even have a rocket to get them when he offered to Biden to go get them!! It is SO SAD the Democrats want to continue running our Country into bankruptcy!!! Schumer said on TV, they hired 235 Progressive Judges before President Trump took over. He said, we WILL get our CONTROL back!! Everything I’ve read says Marxism, Socialism and Communism all have to have CONTROL of everything and everyone.  If you look up Bernie Sanders, it says he’s a Democratic Socialist!! So, America, go figure where we are headed! SAD!! I LOVE our Country, President, all of his Cabinet choices and Elon and team for showing us what has been going on and how it can be corrected. Thank God for their dedication in Making America Great Again!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
😮 / []
I lost about six thousand dollars because I had stock in Tesla and Elon Musk called a US Congressman a Treasoner because he supported Ukraine. I support Ukraine. The Dems and their pension fund manager allies were selling, so the Secretary of the Treasury recommended that we support Elon by buying Tesla. I bought a large position. Many patriotic US investors bought some Tesla stock. I was not watching the news carefully enough. Suddenly my stock went down 2%. That is when this show was on the air. The next day, the stock went down 3.6% when morning people watched this You Tube video. A good number of patriotic US investors believe that Trump is absolutely very wrong on Ukraine. It is depressing that Trump can be so wrong on something so obvious. / []
This discussion was awesome! / []
He says he wants to go after those who fund and spread propaganda but he is offering $2Million to the Supreme Court voters in Wisconsin .. what a hypocrite! / []
We love you DOGE and Elon! Please keep doing what you're doing! Most of America really appreciates it!!!! / []
Won't see this on CNN LOL 😂  God Bless America and President Trump ❤ your Northern neighbor 🇨🇦 / []
This is TOTALLY AMAZING! Thank you all for being transparent!  I am ashamed the government has gotten to this sad point! Thank You, Love You ALL! / []
ELON, I AM SO SORRY FOR ALL THE HATE YOUR GETTING.  YES, THERE ARE SOME EVIL AND EMPTY SOULED PEOPLE OUT THERE😢😢 / []
National heroes 🙌🏻 / []
👏👏👏❤ / []
This is MIND Boggling!! If I were to do this I would be in jail!! No doubt about it, this is the double standard the under privileged is talking about!! / []
Now you know why these leftist radicals are having a meltdown and I love it keep it up DOGE got my popcorn ready😅 / []
If your life sucks you need to watch and see why😂😂😂…. No wonder they wanted  to take your guns / []
Deliberately broken systems put in place by the corrupt, so the corrupt can feed off our taxes.  Those fighting this necessary work, are most likely corrupt themselves. / []
Too many cooks in the kitchen applies here. / []
Mr Musk is an American hero and deserves our thanks!! / []
Wow!!!!! I am so happy you guys are helping get our government straightened out. / []
Elon Musk's team is  a breath of fresh air that is coming to all Americans with common sense.  These 9 men are of more valor than the entire Democratic Party. Should I become President one day, I will have to consult with such a team for effective government function. TRUMP AND ELON ALL THE WAY TO 2040. / []
Imo, any country, 38 trillion in debt and continually printing fiat money is bankrupt . / []
Really Bret, asking why are they doing this, it’s a joke / []
Convenient how they only speak to things we already knew. The problem is not with fixing those things- the problem is with the chaos and firings!!!! The President could have allowed the Inspector Generals to fix this in his first administration legally!  DOGE is wasteful and illegal!! Fox again has allowed a coordinated press conference for the MAGA Project 2025!! / []
.they may all have neurolinks - do you hear their speech patterns ? ijs- smart but maybe all robots lol / []
Great interview. Thank you to the entire team / []
I am going to simply say,  this is why America is number one, yes this should have been part of our system yet as noted has gone 50 or more years unchecked. Now my reason for posting is to convey my sincere thanks to the Doge team moving forward I am now supporting your effort and results to keep our country in its leadership position globally. "Astonishing ", is the right word Elon (you are) / []
That's great, Elon!! Go after the lying news outlets and the ones spreading the propaganda and brainwashing Americans for their own selfish greed. Find a way. Thank all of you! You're appreciated more than you know by the majority of the people. / []
My good God...............he is such a smart man.   I wonder how long Trump was thinking about bringing him on board?    He (Trump) is sure a lot more organized this go around.      How the Dems can be obsessively and frantically against what these guys are doing......I just don't get it. / ['"applying private sector business rules.........to the government"   "We are (essentially) changing the culture"     I sure don\'t have a problem with that !', 'Standing ovation for these guys.']

Their mission is great, but if they give out checks to Americans from all of the waste, everyone should get one. / []
I enjoyed this but it reinforces the typical woman entitlement. The first lady was obviously not American and she was refreshing. The second woman was everything I avoid. When I hear the magic 3 words "strong independent woman" my interest is squashed. She's never going to date down,  or at least poor. Any woman that measures a man by his income is not worth dating. It will surely fail. I'm always excited to see you walking in your swimsuit, 👀 but I'm generally not excited about American women and their opinions.  They are a lost cause. / []
Elon is a white racist man trying to make American only white racist again / []
The team at DOGE don't look like a bunch of 20 year old hackers to me. / []
These people are so effing SMART!  Imagine overhauling a whole country's systems. I feel so very small. Why would you doubt a Musk? / []
I appreciate that DOGE is finally getting in the doors for hard looks at the bureaucratic state. And I'm sure much of the savings are legitimate. But I think having a dollar savings goal is a problem. If there's a dollar target, in this case $1 trillion, then they're pressuring themselves to cut to reach that target. Could cause excessive cutting. / []
Denaturalize and deport MUSK, banned from the US !! / []
Senator Kelly is an American veteran.  So was Benedict Arnold. / []
😆😆😂 How can you not have one? Even in Türkiye, there is an e-government application? / []
Salute Elon. I felt the empathy Elon had @ the end of the interview. / []
He's not lying about fraudsters changing people's Direct Deposit info. People have complaining for along time about it. / []
I love Trump, Musk, and the DOGE TEAM❤ THIS IS AMAZING!!! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE. MAGAZINE👍🇺🇸 / ['🤮🤢sorry had to puke  somewhere 🤑 shameful future 👀! We will isolate us and the Dollar']

O really hope they Cut John Kerrys Funding for his trips everywhere as the Global Warming Zarr aka Initiative.  No more Waste and this has been funded for many years  of Failed Govt officials staying paid in Govt. / []
PEOPLE START SHARING THIS !!!!! THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT VERY EYE OPENING / []
These Kind and Intelligent People deserves our respect and support ❤Thank You for making this Country rich and safe for our children / []
This is so great.  I'm really happy you guys have done this interview.  I think it's a very transparent and open face-to-face communication that really helps build trust and understanding which is really important right now.  Nice one, guys.  Keep up the epic work. / []
4:16 "IS IT ACTUALLY POSSIBLE" BLMCELROY 👈🏼😊The question I set out to answer👉🏼YES OR NO / []
Great interview. It's time that there's some real pressure pushed on any politician that is against doge. / []
If you're against Elon and the DOGE bros then you are either a spiteful mutant or in on the grift and graft. / []
Old fashioned witch hunt / []
Thank you to all of you for your work on this, I greatly appreciate your hard work to make this a better country. We all have our strong points and this type of work is not mine. So thank you for helping the American people. / []
FINALLY! We've grown up hearing EVERY politician claim they would do this. Lies!  It takes a CITIZEN-led administration  to get the job done. Now look who tries desperately to stifle this progress....politicians, puppet judges and the mouthpeice of the Democrat Party.....all the medias. / []
I live in Arizona Elon is right. / []
Perhaps hiring a DOGE watch team will help to ease some peoples fears. / []
Get her done. Doge merica lol / []
This is a great piece!!! curious 37:04 what is that background noise? A woman or a dog? or something else? / []
If I were Mr. Musk, I would not have troubled myself with attempting to rescue these left-wing socialist imbeciles from their own folly. It is an utterly thankless endeavour that he has embarked upon, and to be met with criticism for it is nothing short of astonishing. The fact that so many outspoken, conceited, smug, and profoundly gullible Democrats find fault with his application of logic and rationality speaks volumes about the current state of political discourse.  Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur and innovator, has consistently demonstrated an unwavering commitment to advancing human progress through his various ventures, such as Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. His efforts to promote free speech and challenge the prevailing narratives on platforms like X have been met with fierce resistance from those who cling to their ideological biases. These self-proclaimed champions of social justice, often hailing from the left-leaning spectrum of the Democratic Party, seem to prioritise their feelings over facts and reason.  The American political landscape appears increasingly polarised, with the Democratic Party veering towards policies that some critics argue resemble socialism—a system that has historically led to economic stagnation and the erosion of personal freedoms in nations like Venezuela and Cuba.  Musk's decision to engage with these issues, despite the inevitable backlash, underscores his dedication to fostering a more open and honest dialogue. However, the vitriol directed at him by those who prefer to wallow in their own sanctimonious echo chambers suggests that his efforts may be akin to casting pearls before swine—an exercise in futility when faced with such entrenched ignorance and arrogance. / []
What a IMPACTFUL STATEMENT! " The appearance of GOODNESS over the Reality of it!" but that's the entirety of our Gov't. Time for a huge RESET... / []
Why is the cadence of all the voice the same? / []
T hank you all so much for giving your time, your knowledge and your wisdom to correct our government. We owe you all a lot. Than you Elon this is one of the most important jobs to do / []
Brett's wearing more makeup than Tammy Faye Bakker. / []
No Democrat can MATCH the BRAINS in that group... Dems run on instilling FEAR and VIOLENCE... they NEVER govern.. they are truly the WORST / CRIMINAL minded group in the History of this country... many are Marxists, Communist, or radical progressives... that is NOT DEMOCRACY... that type has no business living in REAL FREEDOM... we will NEVER permit that to happen. / []
MAGA, never be confused. Fox News is not our friend. / []
Thank you to all the team on DOGE!  This is what we voted for! / []
Democrats are cultists / []
This panel of men is what the future looks like. If you are a woman or any other person who doesn't look like the people on this panel, you will be the servants of these people in the future. / []
Solutionists at work who care about the effectiveness of the U.S. government. What a revolution! / []
Go Team DOGE! Thank you all for what you're doing! / []
The mob of America is over thanks to Elon. Free speech has been restored because of Trump. History will mark them as the 2 men that saved this nation. / []
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer ✅ / []
The whole interview is wonderful, indeed how lucky we are to finally have something done.  Yet the closing comments of Elon regarding the war in Europe is moving and 100% accurate. / []
Why does Pres.Marx want to be the spotlight? He should let others speak / []
I can't believe the richest man in the world has so MUCH to complain about. All of those billionaires just whine and moan any chance they get. Far more than us normies. And they absolutely refuse to leave the rest of us alone & just be happy with their riches. If I was a billionaire I'd be on my yacht in Spain with my husband, not running through DC with 19 year old's named Big Balls. All the money in the world and still attention hungry losers. / []
over 60,000 millionaires and billionaires filed to receive social security benefits. cutting that would save a billion dollars but they won't do that. Also removing the cap on income over $176,000 would make the program abundant for decades. But nope, they want to hurt poor people first and foremost. / []
How can you not appreciate everything Elon and his team are doing. It long overdue and I appreciate it so very much, so thank you yall💕🥰❤️🇺🇸💯😊💕🥰 / []
This video should be made mandatory for all students in school to watch. 5th grade +. / []
Is Pres.ElyonMarx's Grok now managing the AI component of the government system ?🤡 / []
God speed Elon and team! / []
But the liberals were too concerned about using the wrong pronouns!   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆🤣😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
Tesla not stressing he has full coverage / []
These fellas are sus as heck! / []
Thank you DOGE! You are appreciated! / []
So can we as taxpayers get some of our money back? / []
Elons and trumps problem is the way they communicate. If more people understood them and they trolled less and acted more like a leader people aspire to the divide wouldn’t exist. But they’re horribly offensive, troll the left at every turn and they don’t demonstrate empathy for the most vulnerable of Americans. If they fixed this this wouldn’t be a party issue. / []
wow that woz  a good show well done elon  uk / []
Notice Bret Baier never asked Musk for proof of evidence. How can you ask for something that isn't there.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😢😅😅😅😅😅😅 / []
Agreed, we have a 2021 model Y and it’s fantastic! / []
I dont know if usa lives under a rock or sth but you wouldnt get a loan in my vountry eveven if u tried. Smells like BS / []
We Happy Few is What the Deepstate have done to Some of these Terrorists they Believe the Lie Need to Quit taking / []
i love DOGE.. you guys rock. Also thank you ... / []
Billionaires are not geniuses — they’re opportunists who exploit actual geniuses. / []
Thank you / []
Great interview! / []
you can tell these are all extremely, highly intelligent people / []
Everyone should watch this video / []
This is amazing information! / []
Elon for President / []
Mark Kelley needs to represent ARIZONA and has no business hijacking a peace process avoiding a nuclear escalation. IMHO that IS treasonous. He is an opportunist and a gun grabber from what I have seen while living in Arizona for decades. Like Raul Grijalva, we have had an open border forever and neither he NOR his wife had ever helped the situation one bit. Why not???   Because  an open border is very profitable and politically favorable. He also has a great "interest" in really high-flying balloons and Chinese flags. Do your own research. He is an insult to all bald American males. / []
And who is going to get the money that they are  saving...hmmm / []
English person here , sounds like the money problems are within your own systems and goverment , not europe / []
So what do we have here...we have a privileged billionaire, an South African-Canadian citizen, who is an immigrant.  Born with a very silver spoon in his mouth and knows no want and has never been poor, is the one who can tell what is waste and what is necessary.🤡 / []
Unfortunately there are adults with children that take Loans and Credit in t8Childrens name I know for a Fact it's been done. Met someone who bragged about it. Outsmarting the system and trashing children Credit before their Adults. / []
We can see in Elon Musk his sincere heart to do the right thing and to find the way to help people, his heart is like the heart of a kid and that is preciousness!!❤ / []
Corruption soldiers. Thank you!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
Thank you Dodge Team!!! About time to end the corruption in the government. I believe this guys. For the longest time one of my family members has been collected social security for a grandfather that has been passed over 20 years. 👏 🙌 / []
Keep going DOGE, go go go / []
This is wonderful!!🎉 / []
This is GREAT CLEAR THE RECORD. / []
Bret seems to be paid to ask some mean questions? Why do that Bret? You’re causing me and others to stop watching Fox News / []
God Bless DOGE! / []
Thank you Jesus almighty for using this amazing group of people, thank you Lord for giving America a second chance, we can’t do nothing without you fighting our battles, let your will be done in earth  as it is in Heaven / []
I worked in that Mine in PA.  It is a step back in time to the 50s.  The government needs to get younger and more modern. / []
Really Elon 🤡🤮 GO HOME AND TAKE CARE YOUR BUSINESS / []
I’m am living back in the 1990s when white men dictated nonsense!!!!😢 / []
Elon and his team will go in history as some of the kindest, brightest and caring people who changed America and the world. Same goes for our President and his cabinet / []
He said trump is a honest man😁😆😅😂😂😂😂🤣 know i know for sure elon full of it.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤫 / []
Awesome Elon!! Keep up the good work!!The critics need to sit down and pipe down !! Prayers of covering from our God. / []
American Business Avengers assemble for the win!! God bless you in Jesus Holy Name! Greetings from Cameroon!!! / []
We are lucky to have them. Thank you for your service !! ❤🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Wow this really is crazy. Cant audit a system but all of us can be. / []
Why is Snopes reporting that Stacey didn't have anything to do with the 2 billion. Snopes, is usually truthful. / []
It is mind boggling that a lot of people that are against these guys who work free to make the government efficient. / []
They hate Musk because they were gaming a broken system / []
Im not religious but please God bless Elon Musk, literally doing gods work and people attack him.. shame on you.  love and support from australia! 🇳🇿 / []
Today is a great day to be alive. / []
What I voted for / []
God bless President Trump....  God bless Elon Musk.....  God bless this great team and each member of DOGE team   God bless USA.....  Much respect and love from Nigeria......  This is really huge..... now I know the reason the Dems are crying like little babies / []
Money hungry 😋 evil people 😮😮😮 / []
It's 2025. Stop posting edited interviews. / []
The presenter should work in Trump’s service, everything about him is good! Every second of this interview is gold! 🏆👌👏  Elon and Team we ❤you!!!!!!! / []
When are those people / contract holder / fraudsters going to be held accountable for their lawlessness against the US taxpayer?? / []
CNN out there complaining about the lack of diversity on the DOGE management team. I apologize to everyone for ever voting Democrat in the past. / []
Thank you Elon and team. These are real revolutionists 🇺🇸 / []
Wow! Amazing!  Thank you, each one of you dedicating your time to help all of America!  How can anyone be against this! / []
I am sure DOGE is going to refine the US entirely.. / []
What was that howling dog towards the end around 37 minutes 10 seconds / []
More money 💰 😮😊❤ok.🎉$$$. / []
Legendary picture. The team tha saved America! / []
This administration will go down as the best of all time / []
People listed as over 120 years old in the data base aren’t fake, their families have inherited their social security benefits.  Either they’re intentionally lying to the public, or grossly incompetent. And they don’t strike me as incompetent. / []
Thank you DOGE❤❤ / []
I wish this team would tackle the health care exchange it is criminal what happens there. Also unemployment benefits. Someone fraudulently claimed unemployment benefits in my son's name and he never received the money but got a W2 about it and tried to correct it and nobody at the agency would correct it so it went on his taxes as income. And I imagine at some point he'll be sued to repay it even though he never got it . / []
Prayers for each of you! Don’t grow faint in well doing!!! / []
All the Democratics and the people that against DOGE should watch this. / []
These guys are heros we are blessed to have these guys in the united states. Thanks for serving our country we love you because you is making the future bright for us our children and grand children.  Thanks again MR.ELON MUSK WE LOVE❤❤❤❤❤YOU AND YOUR CREW.  ALSO TO MY FAVORITE  PREZ TRUMP WE LOVE YOU TO❤❤❤❤❤ GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU THANKS AGAIN.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. / []
We are so lucky to have these geniuses on this problem. / []
Ok the courts have ordered the rehire of federal workers.   1. The fact: none were fired through "Reduction in Force" (RIF).   2. The Fact: They were terminated due to performance. And because DOGE sent letters using this language "performance", which was not accurate, they have to rehire them.  Why do we as Republicans start this? We saw the people protesting because they were locked out of their offices employment was terminated. The approach needs to be respectful to the federal workers and DOGE needs to be truthful and own their errors. Then they could move forward without opposition. 🙏🏾🙏🏾 Let's honor Christ and His standard!! ✝️✝️✝️ / []
They are all GoOfBaLlS !!!! Not government employees and billionaires looking for loopholes to.make themselves richer lol man... / []
I am so grateful to this team for their dedication to this awesome mission!  God bless and protect them all…… / []
Well they could find a ton in the VA system. Why is it that one VA can't pull up information at another VA? They have so many departments for simple stuff that one person can handle. I have like 25 plus contacts and I'm not even injured like others. I would classify mine as 6 out of 10 in need of support. So I can only imagine what other worse off than me have to go through.   PLEASE DOGE INVESTIGATE THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION!!!!!!! / []
All these DOGE findings should be front page everywhere. Corruption is the reason they are not. MSM days are over! Time for hibernation is over. The truth will set you free. / []
This should be broadcast like a serious emergency would be. It needs to be seen by 300 million+ Americans / ["In other countries it is. Our media is so evil and against America, it's really a shame; even (D) people should be happy about this, but they are always finding a way to spin this, just like the evil media."]
Thank you soooooo much magnificent Elon and this team of wonderful great man for what you are doing for this country. God bless and protect you!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Thank God for Elon and his team. / []
These people are heros!!! They do this for a cause! / []
Do democrats even watch this source material to see what the DOGE team are saying and doing here??? Please like and comment if you're a Democrat watching / []
This is the out of control bleeding this nation has suffered for decades. It needs to stop! These men aren’t traitors, they’re heroes for having the strength to fix a system so broken that it’s been hidden underground for generations. / []
Unfortunately there are adults with children that take Loans and Credit in t8Childrens name I know for a Fact it's been done. Met someone who bragged about it. Outsmarting the system and trashing children Credit before their Adults. / []
Thank you Elon and others DOGE for helping our nation. I voted for this to be done. Thank you President Trump and DOGE for everything you're doing to help save our America. 👍🇺🇲🦅🙏✝️🫡 / []
Yes the single mom who owns a home but can't get medical care or food assistance. / []
Trump knows to bring in experts! This is what makes America great: using the countries resources and talents! Even if I do not like the way he announced DOGE, I know a relaunch into modernity was desperately needed! This seems very sudden and Trump uses it to promote himself both as a person and persona  but the principle is 100% right! / []
Thank you DOGE!!  The American taxpayer supports you! 🇺🇸💰🇺🇸 / []
This wasn't a live interview this was produced 🧐🧐🧐🧐 🤨🤨🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 we in debt but trump got new F47 fight jets being built. PIenty money for Israel and contractors I call bullsh*t😤😡😡🤬🤬🤬 / []
The democratic politicians are mad bc THEY are the ones stealing the money!!! It's so obvious!!!!😅 / []
I'm not a big Bret Baier fan, but maybe there is hope. This is the best interview I have seen about DOGE and their purpose and motivation. / []
President  Trump and Elon musk, together they are unstoppable!❤so glad I voted for President Trump  3times!  I knew the nail on the coffin was when Elon  supported President Trump the next day our President almost got assassinating.  Our President has gone to so much to MAGA, I LOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NOW I LOVE ELON MUSK & LITTLE X❤ / []
As a social security recipient I would just like to say--THANK YOU!! / []
How dare he save us money! / []
The propaganda from the Enemedia is so captivating to the ignorant.  I'll show this to my mom and she'll not believe it!  It's seriously insane. / []
Those men are real patriots, God bless each one of them. / []
Brett pushing back. He is too good for the Trump propaganda network.   Leave Brett! We can see it’s killing you! / []
This revelation is mind-blowing and the disorganization is sickening. Every American should see this on all the major networks. Thank you Trump/Elon/Staff God bless you all. / []
Thank you for the transparency. Y'all are bada$$ / []
I know this was difficult for Brett Baier because he is somewhat of a shill, but hats off to him! / []
I am glad / []
BUSINESS LEADERS PUT LIVES ON HOLD TO JOIN THE ROBBING OF THE GOV'T FOR THEIRSELVES. / []
Just cause you break it to bits doesn’t mean it is for the public good you asswipes / []
Thank you Jesus almighty for using this amazing group of people, thank you Lord for giving America a second chance, we can’t do nothing without you fighting our battles, let your will be done in earth  as it is in Heaven / []
The BEST thing we've EVER seen. Government is now representing the will of the people. / []
I'm happy to see most of this interview.  However, the complete divergence comes with Musk's stanch ability to turn the backs on the Ukrainians and his belief that if they just give the country to Russia that nobody else would die.  Actually, if Russia would leave, then nobody else would have to die, but once Russia controls the area you'll never hear of the atrocious behaviors behind their curtain. Even their people in Kaliningrad want to leave Russia and want to break away. / []
Elon, can you guys please make it to where we would get our monthly check on the same day every month rather than whenever this is 2025 after all, I personally get my Direct Deposit on the 16th or the 18th or the 21st or the 23rd but never consistent, my bills always come on the same day it seems lf I  I knew when I’m getting paid I would be able to budget better and  make my life easier. Not looking for a raise only more consistency. TY keep up the great work. / []
How do you save 1 trillion dollars when then 1% billionaires get a 4.5  trillion dollars in tax cuts? / []
Brett is obviously not acquainted with Aspergers people like Elon and myself. He seemed to not be uncomfortable with Musk's eye contact and facial expressions and looked away almost shamefacedly (watch the end portion one on one in particular). Perhaps Brett should read up! / []
This is a must watch interview, make America solvent again! / []
the messed up part is that it only takes political will to do this. not an Elon, not a Doge, not a Trump. it is shameful that we let the political class to do this everywhere in the world. / []
Love elon / []
All politics aside, I don't see how anybody cant say this panel is the best group to complete an audit and address the financial concerns of the United States. / ['Audit and financial concerns? You seem to have a very limited understanding of their mandate which goes beyond just accounting and auditing, but especially EFFICIENCY in the operating of government agencies.', 'Of course! Many bow to the skillful, charismatic persuasion  which this team epitomizes.\nCarefully listening to this charade, I find many weak arguments that need to be researched carefully before accepting them.\nThe DOGE leaders thrive on those who accept their fast talking at face value.', 'A rocket scientist???🤣🤣', 'Maybe if Musk actually did graduate with a Econ degree but, no, he had to buy it because he is not smart enough to graduate.', '@yo4ellie So do you plan to research those weak arguments, or do you plan to just continue denigrating their efforts?']
Anyone who opposes what these men have come together to do, should think seriously about whether they want America to be great or die. It is simple. Correct or go bankrupt and become dependant on foreign aid like the rest of the world. / []
Are they expanding operations to US territorios? / []
A lot of bots in the comments / ['U are one of the bots 😂😂', '@ no son I’m not these people are gonna rob us blind', "@Placefriday\xa0 no son I'm not", '@ thats exactly what bots would say 😂😂', '@Placefriday\xa0 oh so you just a troll and a bot cause you know what they say']
At 33:50, CNN and everyother liberal media are pushing propaganda too...😮 / []
Hi I’m from the UK. This is incredible. I’m struggling to see why anyone can find fault with this. Unless you are a fraudster yourself / []
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Please take the 2B back!!!! / []
W Elon / []
We could do with this team in the UK! There is just endless waste over here and as usual the average taxpayer is paying for this sickening bloat. / []
Social security should have thumbprint or retina recognition or something that ensures privacy and accuracy. A number is no longer enough to ensure security. / []
Please do this in the UK we need it so desperately! / []
❤+ / []
Keep up the good work 💯 / []
I keep this entire administration in my prayers each day. I ask nothing for myself, I ask only for their safety. Its so important the work they're doing, at great personal sacrifice. I'm in awe of their courage and love for the U.S.A. / []
This interview is/was great 👍 👌 👏 🙌 😀 / []
So... if the government wanted to bring down unemployment numbers so that their administration would look good.. they would just create jobs and not even require them to come to work? Dang.. I missed the boat there. / []
Good interview / []
❤ / []
Elon is not a king! He need's to respect the rules of American democracy! If Elon wanted his agenda to go smoothly, he'd not make half the country as the enemy, he'd unite them and you unite people by listening to them, not forcing them and you also become completely transparent. Elon isn't showing up on the house floor letting congress and senate know what he's doing...this is what's causing all the friction. He owes everyone in the US the right to know what he's doing in the Gov, and they have the right to vote him in or out, of what he's doing. For Elon not to know this very thing, shows his lacking in intelligence. He's creating friction in this country. / []
what about Israel is that America first ? u double faced c**** / []
GOD BLESS / []
I LOVE THIS! But why does it take a possible collapse for all the elite thinkers to “pause their life” and serve. / []
He didn’t answer the 1st question / []
May God protect Trump, Elon, and Doge team. / []
If what they’re saying is true and they are doing what they say, it’s wonderful work. I wish I could believe them without being skeptical. / []
These men are true blue heroes. / []
Is there any way to recoup the monies that were given out fraudulently? / []
It’s absolutely worth it to me!…don’t give a sh!t about what the others think✌️ / []
All you supporters,  just wait until Trump gives away all these savings in tax cuts to the billionaires and not you.  Just wait. / []
One day, we will look back and say, thank goodness a couple highly successful businessmen looked over the government / []
Let's not pretend these billionaires are not benefiting immensely from what they're doing.  Sure, everyone knows that our government is inefficient, but this idea that only the billionaires can fix it is a ridiculous sentiment.  The statement that people are dieing for "nothing" in Ukraine... Democracy is nothing?  Their country's sovereignty is nothing?  They are being invaded by a country ran by a dictator.  I do not want someone who thinks this way to represent my government in any way. / []
True patriots and heros / ['🤣You don\'t know how to spell "heroes". This is indicative of how educated the typical maga voter is. Thank you for this exhibit A']
Those people are the best of all. We need them for America 🇺🇸 / []
Thank you to all these men! What a joke the whole establishment is. Revolutionaries / []
“This is not sustainable” finally, a voice of reason. Eliminating 1T of a 2T deficit is not enough, the US should have a balanced budget. / []
Thank you, DOGE!! / []
Elon + Trump + Lutnick are the GOAT POWER TRIO of all time. No offense to Rush, of course. / []
Elon musk and his team should be national heroes, they are more American that's what I think 😊😊 / []
This is all Great.  Can't wait I am 60 not able to retire just yet. But when i do go from Dissability to Retirement benefits it will be fixed. Not sure what age it is now. / []
I hope most of the country is on one page with them if ya we good / []
Every American needs to know this. / []
Democrats are so brainwashed and pathetic / []
you realize this is a top tier team, right? / []
Which one is big b@ll$??!!😂 / []
Id like a 1 on 1 with anyone who goes after a tesla. Come to yuba city with that bs and we'll show you the ways of Christ. / []
These idiots are pouring sensitive information onto the internet. Disclosing that there is 1 main bank account, with $800B in it, how many passwords associated … BEGGING to be hacked. This administration is being ran by morons / []
You know why it's only on fox and on X.Stop the BS / []
This is why I voted for Trump (among a few other policies. The Dems offered nothing at all). He "hired" some of the best business minds out there. They are problem solvers and think "out of the box" for creative ideas - some may work and some may not - but we know we cannot look at ourselves in the mirror and think what we have been doing is sustainable. / []
Go Doge and go Elon 🇺🇸 / []
Thank you Mr Elon I'm buying Tesla stocks / []
Dear democrats if everything they are saying is true would you still protest what they are doing ? / []
This is historic !!!! And to think Joe Biden mocked a smaller government !!  LMAO / []
every single idiot who is so viciously against DOGE gets to personally walk themselves through the Iron Mountain retirement process.  domestic terrorists like AOC, Schumer and the rest are extremely laughable jerks doing so much damage to logic and well being. / []
What countries are calling to change this to their account? / []
The best Fox interview ever!! / []
One lie… about the mine. The mine exists, but the records were updated from paper to microfiche in the 1990s and have since been digitized. No one uses paper records today, especially in federal and state government. It’s the half-truths woven with lies that concern me. Why not just tell the whole truth? Their success depends on it. / []
I am happy they're shaking things up.... most government, state, cou ty, and city workers are incompetent, lazy, cons, and arrogant....they hardly work or care about the people they're here to help....maybe they'll start giving af now that their job is on the line....and ive said for years that America is very outdated, especially compared to Japan....even our infrastructure is old.... / []
Everthing is perfect, its just funny how everyone kinda talks like Elon Musk, i mean like the oauses, right? Well all is for the best / []
Nana says Thank You. / []
The most powerful interview I have ever witnessed. Wow! / []
Do you need show an ID to vote in the US? / []
Good interview. Thank you for doing this.  These men are very admirable for serving our nation in this way. / []
Whoever is not happy with Elon and DOGE effort for what they’re doing is a fraudster. / []
He can talk to Fox but he can't go and talk to Congress, give me a break / []
can you see how Elon picked up a bottle of water under the chair...he is a real Men... / []
this is amazing.... great inteview and American should be greatful for this effort and each one of those men... the Democrats are shameful people who don't care about Americans... they just want to maintain power, moneylaundering, and wars.... don't vote Democrat folks. / []
Reminds me when we ,in the medical industry, had to move to EMR. Amazing they haven't done this, since they forced us over the last 20 years / []
Thank you Elon and Fox for bringing this monumental forum to us. Awesome job. Best reporting I've seen in my life. Keep up the good work. Brilliant. 🙂🙏🇺🇲👍🗽 / []
THANK YOU. / []
No obesity, no transgenders just normal folks using common sense and doing the right thing. You go America! Everything started with you and everything will end with you! Lets make the world great again! / []
Hope everyone is right and I hope this is what America needs to be debt free! Only time will tell if this is truly for the good of the country! / []
Hate him or love him, he works for us. For FREE. If you love him you with him, if you hate him you are the reason America it is where it is today. / []
It feels like we as Americans let people come into our house and eat all her food spent all of our money and they're mad because we kicked them out! And had somebody fix it! / []
America is back!!   They almost looked like the avengers up there !! true American heroes / []
thank you for their patriotism. / []
BS ! / []
Wow this is absolutely amazing. I know it's controversial but I'm happy to be alive. I'm so thankful that good men are fighting the terrible corruption that I don't care if you're on the right or the left everybody knows our government is corrupt.   It's about time someone held them accountable. / []
Thank you all so very much DOGE TEAM! The call for action has come! This is true Patriotism, as the DOGE Militia is responding to this critical infrastructure threat to America and Americans everywhere. My heart goes out for all you have suffered and endured and sacrificed. Because of the ignorance of so many..It’s a tough pill to swallow, but after they end up having their RED PILL moment. They too will understand that in history Great Americans stood up! In the face of inconvenience danger and self sacrifice. For the Greater Good! 👍 / ['All the war veterans that were fired by trump are gonna end up working for the state government anyway. Its all BS']
This is incredible / []
Unbelievable!!!!!! / []
Amazing interview!! Very informative. Now we gotta somehow get this out to all the lunatics!!! / []
One of the Greatest  leaders of American  history, TRUMP AND TEAM God bless you and your team  God bless you'll / []
this makes me so mad. I work for local government and we could never do any of the things the federal government does! / []
Unreal / []
Thank you so much to Elon and all the others.  No matter the babble you see on television, you are greatly appreciated / []
Why don’t Fox interview the people that doge had taken the jobs away from them interview them to see what they have to say. Some of these people voted for Trump. / ["I know, because they're all gonna end up working for state government."]
"FOR WHAT" 🎯 / []
Why did Biden paid Masih Alinegad 300 million dollars which his brother was not in Islamic Republic prison but he has his shop and writes also books. These kinds of people are high in America where they have lots of money nonsense. / []
I belive this storys, when people     Go to Jail. When fraudsters have been put in Front of the Court. No matter if its politician, judge or Police. If 15mio retirements are Fake, there should be at least a 10mio people in Jail. If all the ngo fraudstsers get accountable for their Choices half of the Country should be in Jail. 😅 Jeah I am no big mathematition but you get what I mean. / []
I instinctually criticize any information. Not because of what some people would think. Its apart of the natural curiosity im afflicted with. Im not satisfied until i have a well rounded understanding of things. Although i appreciate this panel discussion, i didn't need it to alleviate any skepticism.  It was already apparent to me that what they described was the operation under foot.  Thank you for your services.  I see your sacrifice.  I see the  physical, emotional, financial, and potential reputation harm you face. Its not for nothing. And there are people of lesser influence out here with mighty hearts that will defend your names and your means to achieve the change we all want.  Hopefully the scum in sheeps clothes becomes obvious to even the most impressionable mind.  This is the most patriotic and significant action in my life. There isnt a more reasonable effort that could be made but actually make a difference in our cancerous government. Thank you . / ["Unfortunately, Musk has presented himself as a Notsee. I can't trust him."]
Are there any Democrats watching this?  what are your thoughts on this great work give me thumbs up or down if you think they are doing a great work or bad work / []
if u open your ears, they are saying a whole lotta nothing. there is no substance in their responses. just saying what their supporters want to hear. every time they're asked "when will such and such happen" they respond with a vague answer and just talk about hopes and dreams. / []
I'm not a Trump supporter but this is what our country needs!!! / []
I would like to thank these men for their service to the American people. Thank you for securing a future for my family and grandchildren. / []
Wow!  They all lunatics! It will take one computer virus to stop the whole America! / []
Really have to respect Trumo and his picks and trump and elon is risking their lives by doing their job, Americans should respect their effort rather than criticise and judges frustrate their efforts. And reporters attack them like a pack of wolves. / []
Thank you, Elon and Team / []
U... can't... make... this...up. It's like a bunch of kids were managing the Treasury and no adults were watching. Need a billion... here u go. Need $500k... here u go. 😳 / []
Kinda Makes Sense 😊 / []
I suggest a separate entity computer,  just in case the web goes down, a separate backup storage. So checks can still go out in such an emergency. / []
This is intriguing. / []
Your doing a great job Elon. / []
a freakin cave!!! wow. conspiracy theories just became way more valid. / []
I just shared this on my facebook if everyone did this it would defintely go Nation or Worldwide as we all have different friends.  Hopefully, they will also share / []
Biggest take-away: "we are on all the ship, and if the ship sinks, we are all going to go down with the ship." No-one wins. If Elon hadn't stepped up, along with these men, this country WILL go bankrupt. It's just a matter of when. / []
Wow wow / []
@gaylenekirstenscott768 0 seconds ago South Africa needs a team like DOGE to investigate all our government processes and poor financial stewardship of taxpayers’ money. / []
Elon, DOGE team, President Trump, and the entire Trump Administration:  WE LOVE YOU, THANK YOU, and KEEP GOING!!!! ❤ 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
God bless these people / []
Where's Big Balls? / []
He put on a good show and then fell apart at the end. “Trump is a good man who has never done anything mean or morally wrong.” Hard to take him at his word after that one. / []
Every American needs to see this interview. / []
More intelligence in these few men than in the entire Democratic Party!!! / []
Most anti Elon/ Trump democrats and left wingers are just a bunch of envious cry babies, nothing more..nothing less, period. "But but but eAt ThE RiCh" / []
Great interview! / []
Thank God for Elon Musk and the DoGE team. / []
I wouldnt mind giving grandma a lil bump in pay. / []
So why don’t they have people from the federal government there to answer their question  congress have asked them to send Elon to talk to them about what he doing but for some reason republicans and trump refuse why not / ["Because they feel they don't have to answer to them."]
You know something is wrong when they choose a friendly network in Fox.. / []
deport Elon / []
Let this man and his team do their jobs!!! Thank you Mr Elon!!! / []
Thank you doge / []
I think you might have over done it with the bots today Elon ;) / []
Pay attention to those who want to keep the Traitors in our Government. Don't forget there are a great number of Democrats Voters that doesn't care how many Millions/Trillions our Government Officials STEAL for their own Coffers.They simply want all the freebies they can get. They don't care how much hardship the rest of us go through as long as they get to stay home and live off the ones who work. They are the ones now complaining about Trump and the rest who are finding and exposing the Trillions of Dollars Theft. / []
Lies / ['You can’t handle the truth.😂', "@54logscaler You can't handle that Musk is a notsee."]
was that x in the background? 37:05 / []
Great work and thank you for doing this Elon ! / []
Where are the youngsters? / ['Working']
BS / ['You’re in denial buddy.', "@54logscaler Musk is a notsee. You're in denial."]
I am so grateful to all of these men.  Truly.  Thank you for your courage and talent and for doing the right things, not pretending. / []
Honorable men doing honorably things. Bravo! / []
Anyone who hates Elon needs to watch this. He is only trying to help and by no means does this man need to help America while running several billion dollar businesses. / []
BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA!  BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! BAN TESLA! / []
Who, or what entities are cashing these fraudulent checks!?!?! / []
I wish we had this in the UK. America is very lucky to have these people in charge. / []
I work hard for my benefits because I am healing what will benefit others once I'm free to write my book.  I am absolutely 💯 grateful for DOGE and being American so I have been free to find alternative ways and supported during my healing period.  I did not get the surgery that has a mortality rate and saved tax payers that sum.  I have the opportunity to help humanity and could not be more grateful. 🙏 ❤ / []
Transparency, efficiency, saving taxpayers money - these should not be controversial or partisan. / []
Fox news, fake news. Nice show, hope your mums are proud / ['They are.', '@ same as yours']
Threatening opposition is what dictators do. The majority of Americans may change their minds and may NOT want Trump or Elon running the country anymore and to threaten to stop that process of who leads America is criminal. The real fraudsters are those saying "the loudest people are fraudsters". That's the stupidest and most deceptive statement said. Tax the rich if you want to be fair! Also, blaming half the country as the problem is what dictators do. I haven't seen Elon or Trump or anyone in his admin try to bring the country together. In fact...they're only making enemies with everyone around the world accept the corrupt dictators. / []
Only few people really love their country even putting lives in line just to save the sinking boat . Salute to this team May the good Lord Jesus Christ protect and keep you all and your families safe and covered and under the shadow of the Almighty God . Those who are against this team they just care for themselves and just want what something they can get rather than what they can give in return . What happened to the saying ask nit what your country can do for u you but what can you do for your country ?” / []
I disagree with Trump on many things and have been a lifelong democrat but even I see the huge benefits for our country and all of our citizens from DOGE. Stop listening to the media unless you listen to all media and use your brain. That’s my message not only to my fellow democrats, but everyone! So many of my friends are hysterical while listening to only one point of view. / []
This video should be viral all over the world. / []
I’m wondering which of these guys is “BIG BALLS” / ['That guy is wired in, working his butt off at the moment. He’ll take his victory lap after the job is done.']
Share this everywhere you can. / []
If our legacy media wasn’t so corrupt, this would be everywhere and not just Fox.  There is no logical argument against this unless you are in on the grift. / []
This very well educated and intelligent person is doing his thing and is uncovering the real issues of departments and finding out the real problems and corruption in these departments. / []
15 million people over 120 years old?   I bet every single one voted democrat! / []
Which one is Big Balls  😂 / []
It’s refreshing to hear a bunch of intelligent people talking. Loving this. / []
Brilliant idea If Musk wasn’t toxic and CRAZY! / []
DOGE, PLEASE fix every government website!  They're not that good / []
What an amazing team trying to help America, they need to be applauded not put down like Democrats are doing! / []
Yes / []
Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa from 1948 to the early 1990s. / []
Imagine the mental illness someone has to have to dislike what Elon and Doge are really doing. / []
Imagine being a tax payer, working for the government, and just hitting everything with a stamp of approval without giving it any real though or consideration. When Elon says it's "it's moving fast for the government, but slower than he'd like." He's not wrong. The government is incredibly inefficient and a ton of those inefficiency show through when you look at how long it takes to do anything. / []
The democrats are very violent. / []
Let's cut $38 BILLION with one simple change....ELON MUSKS SUBSIDIES AND TAX CREDITS! Thats $38 BILLION to just Musk. Let's cut that. Now. Because we want to save money, right? Until that $38 BILLION is cut, we don't want to hear another word from any of you. / []
If services are going to be cut, access to national parks, social security, veterans services, will  my taxes be cut? Short answer, no! Slashing and burning is not how you cut government services to find $$$. How about this novel idea, let’s make rich people pay more, the middle class pay less, in addition to doge cuts.  While I agree the US gov computer systems could use overhauling, I find it hard to believe that the mine of paper retirements will be digitized in 130 days. 😮 Elon,  I’m holding you to, “you’ll get more $ bc of Doge.”Btw, 15 Mil  over age 120 do NOT receive a check. It’s a leftover coding issue from old school software.  I don’t consider firing whole groups of people w/o cause as using a scalpel or firing key personnel only to have to hire them back, like NRC.  If you want to audit the federal government, then hire a forensic auditor. / []
I heard a lot of great things in this interview and the job Elon and his team are doing is tremendously important. But I didn’t hear that in the result of this honest and hard working people are going to pay less taxes, and the teachers like me are going to get paid better… / []
Get it done get that money back from Stacey  Abraham / []

Now Musk 8s in his element, they think alike, doge bruh / []
Finally Elon musk is not talking like Biden / []
God bless these men!!! Their heart is in the right place!!! Im going to share this over and over / []
Elon doing it again but in Wisconsin. Are we going to allow musk/trump to bribe the constituents every time there’s an election of any kind? He is offering 100 dollars for every signature. He also is offering millions to voters if they sell their votes to him. Always a new way to cheat. Where are the protections of elections when they are needed to fairly elect people.??? / []
As professional should not accuse anyone. But complete the jobs to make successful.  No one wants to hear negative but wants to hear positive results.  This cannot complete over night but must complete together to achieve mission.  People pointing others it’s not going anywhere. Hope everyone understands what I’m talking / []
There needs to be a ceiling on how much money someone can make. Above that ceiling, the money goes back to the country and the people who made these heads of companies rich....the money going into the infrastructure, departments that help regular people live higher and better lives, education, healthy, etc. / []
I hope people realize, what DOGE is trying to save still does not equal the amount our country is in debt over. DOGE is trying to save “A Trillion “ the US is over 37 THIRTY SEVEN TRILLION in debt. It will take years perhaps decades to fix. / []
Democratic opinions are always ridiculous and they can never explain their statements / []
These people are heroes. / []
Ok the survey but not the parks themselves.  Revert that billion and let's go o high o / []
Elon Musk is speaking the truth❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Well... If they cared about solvency, maybe look at the income side of government and not give taxbreaks to rich people. / []
All Medias should be interviewing this team.    But we all know WHY they won’t.   Doesn’t meet their agenda to disgrace Mr Musk and the team. / []
Make  America  grate again / []
Thank you for all your work to help the US become financially balanced / []
Thank God for them taken away peoples job ,.. that has bills to pay! / ['That very sad \nHi it nice meeting you 🥰']
Excellent interview and all the right questions were asked. I am retired civil service so I personally know the DOGE team told the truth. / []
Good job Elon / []
The states taking medication for those in need out when it comes to Medicaid for us who does not get paid for work and homeless / []
I got the answer.          onlyJESUSaves / []
you need to audit the treasury / []
And here I was thinking Doge was just a team of IT geeks. These guys are All Stars man! No wonder the Dems lost, what a bunch of dishonest losers. / ['That really sad though \nHi, it nice meeting you 🥰']
Still…. To this date… zero proof is provided. EVERYTHINGGGGG is just here say. Oh Elon says this and Elon says that. He says what I want to hear. He says what you want to hear….. yet….. zero proof. Why would I believe this guys when he provides zero legitamate proof all while he gains 8 million $ a day and picks up around a billion $ more in contracts for….. you guessed it. His own projects ….. I don’t believe the tooth fairy is actually real because my mother told me that when I was a child …. Nothing different here. Oh btw: Elon is NOT A ROCKET SCIENTIST. / []
Who could argue with this? / []
Is enriching yourself a Mission ??? / []
My guess is, based on how early the Democrats started a propaganda campaign about Social Security, my guess is that there is more to be discovered down that pathway that we may currently realize / []
Sycophants appointed to government will not be responsible.   No one voted for Felon Musk.   No one. / []
I always agreed with doge but feel much better now! / []
This guys are not doge! Where are the 20 year old kids??? / []
Elon actually  cost millions  everyday.  Remove him! / []
3M views in less the 24h...Dems, do not understimate the American intrest in the swamp draineged... / []
EXCELLENT!!  Thank you, Elon, for all that you are doing! / []
Best interview ever! / []
You guys are real heros / []
Oh my god the poor American tax payer was working like a dog for the democrats to spend like a drunken sailor. SO HEARTBREAKING😢😢 / []

Why would we see more and why would that money be put back into the Social Security system to keep it solvent? / []
Elon musk and his doge team, they've been incredible work and a great service for this country and I am also extremely grateful I would like to extend my gratitude to him and let's not forget Donald Trump and what he give up you know to do this thing. And I have a great amount of respect for Donald Trump's cabinet that he put together these are great people.   And once again let's not forget who it was that got this ball rolling that was Mr Trump. Let's not forget how Donald Trump and his family have suffered incredibly at the hands of these Democratic left-wing Lulu's and the swamp. All of these people have done nothing but persecute him and his family ever since 2015 he has suffered financial losses that cannot be underestimated. If I'm not mistaken over the last 3 years or something he has spent about $250 to 300 million just in lawyer fees, I'm not sure about those numbers it's just off the top of my head but it's got to be pretty close if not a lot more. On top of all that they tried to assassinate him. It's only by the grace of God that he's still here dragging his ball around. And we all know who it was that attempted to rub him out.    God bless Donald Trump his family and his crew. May God bless America.   Thank God. / []
May God bless all these men for all their efforts. It’s not thankless as far as I’m concerned. / []
Once DOGE has finished its job, our government needs to be audited, and the findings published regularly for review by the American people so we can hold our government accountable. I think that is DOGE's goal with the new IT system. / []
We are asking him for his budget goals. Is he the Congress? It’s simply unbelievable that Brett bear is asking these questions with a straight face  He has a budget target that what is it a secret they spoke about Kamala Harris not having a plan  The plan for the United States government is to sit down with Elon Musk for an hour on Fox News and discuss the budget   Y’all are freaking insane / []
So when do we see criminal charges? Most of this is CRIMINAL. This is deliberate. Not incompetence. This sure explains how people like Pelosi can be worth millions on a 200K salary.... / []
I used to work for a County of California which is a government entity and we had a saying if it makes sense it won't get done that it has to make no sense at all and the most inefficient way of handling things was the way of the government let's make government make sense. / []
The great thing about a swamp is that once it’s drained there are islands and eventually more land and prosperity. All of Orlando used to be a giant swamp… / []
How can what you are doing help Social Security people when you change the system you close for Social Security offices you find Social Security workers. How are we gonna get our services as quick as we were before? / []
ty elon / ['Elon is that guy \nHi, it’s nice meeting you']
🎉👏 / []
I think the Citizens of America, if they will pay attention,  are finally going to see all the Grift done by our own Elected Officials  and *Unelected Officials* that have been sneaked into our Government for the soul purpose of robbing all of us Tax Paying Citizens Blind. / []
I hope that people recognize the talent of Brett Baier in conducting interviews.  He probes with skill and doesn't stop to have emotional reactions.  He continues with intelligent informed questions. He creates interesting continuity. What a great, informative segment!  Bravo!!❤ / []
I think the scariest and most hilarious aspect of all of this is that bureaucrats and career politicians have known about these things for decades. They’ve also villainized, wealthy, smart people in our country. Here, we put a couple of spectacularly bright people together to solve real problems, and you realize these guys can do it in their spare time just about. It’s really amazing and encouraging to see incredibly wealthy, incredibly smart, incredibly patriotic people do what’s right. / []
Nobody that I noticed on Social Security ever have that happen trying to change your bank routing number, but we do have problems with people calling us, trying to change our insurance / []
It is unbelievable that the country where the best technology in the world is produced has such a bad state of government. / []
Thank you Mr. Musk and team! ❤ patriots love you and baby X / []
HEROES! / []
I watched a astrology prediction over 5 years ago about an American Revolution coming in this era. I had no idea it would be this! Such great news!! 👍 / []
I’ve never received a call about that. Wanted to change my bank. I do receive phone calls for people wanting me to change my health insurance every day. / []
The ending is why we deeply need Elon and Trump / []
I’ve never received a call about that. Wanted to change my bank. I do receive phone calls for people wanting me to change my health insurance every day. / []
Mostly all straight white guys. Racist bigot oppressors destroying the country! / []
These guys are heroes / []
Are you really that dumb Casar? / []
This is great information.  What I find interesting in relation to National Parks etc is the ongoing "closures" of popular area's (like some specific hiking areas within Arches National park just announced.  I think it is an attempt (by the status quo crowd in the NP system etc) to force the public to "feel the pain" of any cuts to anything related to recreation areas etc rather than try to figure out the best place to cut so that the public is least impacted.  It may be necessary in the end to get rid of these NP employees who don't understand that the country is 36 trillion in debt and we can't go on like we have in the past. Find some people who will make due with less like everyone in the Private sector has learned how to do / []
How is supporting Ukraine in the way of any of our other commitments?  We can both defend democracy and take care of our veterans, be efficient in government, be responsible with immigration.  I've noticed many people are creating a false duality, even this or that. / []
How do you protect someone from something when you aren’t even supposed to be doing what you’re doing 😂fact checking have found errors in what you are doing because you don’t know the systems 😂😢😢 unless you do it legally more than half the people won’t trust you / []
You won't be seeing this information on CNN or any liberal news network. / []
This is awesome. Better than I had hoped. Thank you Elon and Gentlemen...... / []
WE always knew big gov was incompetent and wasteful but this is insane how bad it is. / []
I don’t understand why people are against this UNLESS someone is telling them lies. / []
Elon don't forget the USPS. USPS needs to go to private enterprise like UPS, FEDEX. / []

It’s a leftover coding issue from old school software. / []

Love this man thank you Elon we are all behind you / []
👍👍👍 / []
All very interesting, but Is anyone being prosecuted? / []
So refreshing to be listening to intelligent people. / []
My issue with him is that he has also taken upon himself to cut agencies responsible for holding his companies accountable as well as other big corporate agencies that abuse workers and laws. / []
The greatest achievement by any government in the world, since the Apollo moon landings. / []
No one on the left will watch and listen to the full video but will cry and say hes nothing but a liar / []
Who is cashing all those checks..can they be arrested... / []
That was good insight, thanks for sharing! / []
I have to imagine these guys all wanted to go in the leftist networks but they didn’t want to hear the good thats being done. / []
The budget would be resolved if all the politicians, judges, ambassadors, heads of departments, etc, and money that goes to funding their offices, were cut by one third. Those running the government are ALL getting paid way too much. If Elon really cares about America..he's wealthy enough, why isn't he working for free? These people don't care abut the small people, they are only looking out for the top wealthy, otherwise, they'd tax the wealthy fairly! / []
The GUILTY, the THIEVES of the country, are the loudest protesters of DOGE, THAT'S A GIMMIE. / []

Why are there so many loud voices discounting the veracity of these guys? / []
Dear Musk and Co. You've done an amazing job at showing the Republicans how to save tax payers money. You all deserve a golden medal. Can you please show Mike Waltz and Pete Hegseth how to not add people they don't want to a Signal group chat?

In the event of a catastrophic computer system failure, we have the permanent back up database in that cave. \n\nI'm OK with them up updating the system from old-fashioned COBOL and FORTRAN, but don't really want that information in the cloud, because it's a gold mine for people who might want to steal the ID of millions of people.\n\nAnd back when records still were only on paper, pre-computer early, the cave facility is climate and humidity controlled to help keep the paper from breaking down. They might not have digitized every single old record in the system, and there might be a reason to go back and check old records."]
Thank you to each and every one of you. This ripping off of the band-aid is most uncomfortable and somewhat painful, but must be done for the wound to heal. Our nation's continued existence depends upon it. / []
God bless DOGE for the work you're doing for our country! You're all in my prayers. / []
This should be a required watch by every member in Congress. If the Dems are afraid to be seen on a public forum listening and asking these guys questions, have a private session with members of congress from both sides. Let them ask the questions Bret is asking. Open their eyes to the good work DOGE is doing and challenge the things they want to challenge. / []

Which one is Big Balls?😂 / []
Question is the retirement process the for Military and Exc…? / []
What wasn’t said is the government does try to fix their IT systems but what happens is they bring in these big IT companies who bring in low-cost labor and throw a million bodies at it and nothing gets done. What they should instead do is bring in skilled small teams that can put together a cohesive plan and then iteratively go through and build it. But these big IT companies have such a strong lobby I’m not sure it will happen. / []
Everyone should share this and every American should see this!!!! / []
Elon Musk❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤and his team are doing a good job. / []
Best fox interview... EVER! / []
I hope they prop up Sleepy Joe, tape his eyes open and make him watch this. / []
Much Love doge 🎉❤🎉❤ / []
This is a road show.  They’re hoping to privatize government and have first dibs on the work. / []
Keep it up youz guyz!!! 🇺🇸 / []
Thank you Elon Musk and the doge team!!! / []
They haven't fix the infrastructure because they were too busy stealing from us. It is easier to cheat and steal on the older systems.  I think it's going to be harder to cheat and steal with new systems...at least I'm praying. Thank you DOGE / []
I agree with what they are doing. Unfortunately I am on SSD but still try to get part time work because I have always been the back bone of my family. I do think jobs need to be created in this country. My son just graduated with a BFA and has not found work. He has applied to C.I.A. as well. But I do hear that people who loose their jobs, it can take a year to find work. It is very important for people to work. I understand computer systems not speaking to one another. Pharmacy states do not have computers that can check on another on looking up opeates, in tx it is called PMP. / []
I have eggs for you. / []

Go Elon !!’ / []
It is a conversation everyone should listen to.  It is a true eye-opener and an unforgettable discussion / []
What an interview Brett! / []
They are hiding this from the searches! / []
Us Americans are loving every bit of this!!! My hat is off to the whole Doge team and everything they are doing. I fully support going after the ppl pushing the fake propaganda bc that is what's destroying our nation. And they need to pay for doing that, period. / []
Did anyone else else hear what sounded like crying that was going on behind the scene in the last couple minutes of the video?? / []
Are you talking about survivor benefits for children. / []
Thank you guys so much!! We really appreciate what you doing I’m glad we are able to finally see you guys, most of the country is behind you, don’t believe the hype from the other side. / []
I believe there is real evil out there and we have to overcome it ❤ LETS GET IT❣️ / []
If services are going to be cut, access to national parks, social security, veterans services, will  my taxes be cut? Short answer no! Slashing and burning is not how you cut government services. How about this novel idea, let’s make rich people pay more and the middle class pay less, in addition to doge cuts. / []
How refreshing to watch real , intelligent people , instead of lying politicians .  Thank you DOGE . / []
How do they know it’s far left. Maybe it the right that voted trump and got fired. Just don’t assume geeez / []
I'm literally in tears seeing these people working hard for our country and our countrymen and women sing these men that have left their jobs their lives their families to come to the duty of all Americans. It's just all inspiring and it's beautiful and I'm just super emotional I don't know why I'm crying 😂 / []
Finally we don’t have a shadow government. We know what these people are doing! No secrets not even the war plans are secret lmao 🤣. / []
@ Elon...interesting that you say "The real problem is those providing the money and pushing the lies..."  Take a look in the mirror buddy, this is exactly what you are doing.  And yes, your strategy is "Fire, Ready, Aim."  None of you are interested in serving our society.  From appearances, if looks like you are serving white males....isn't half of our population female? Can't women be at the table? / []
Formidable job, have the demons angry / []
Keep up the good work men! / []
Where did the money go? Who was being paid these exorbitant amounts of money? A 10k survey and a billion spent, who or what company was paid, by who? Please follow the money. Thank you Mr. musk and your awesome DOGE team and last but not least thank you President Trump. / []
This needs to be shown in middle schools and high schools across the country in applicable classes or in the auditorium to the whole school. / []
Thank you guys. You are all patriots and american heros. I'm a Maga man but throughout the election DOGE was my biggest excitement of Trumps promises. Any rational logical thinking person sees the good in what your doing. Might just save us from financial ruin / []
This is phenomenal work being done! / []
As I have said over and over again and again. All they are doing is enforcing GAAP in the federal government. Where are the CPAs who work for the Government? Based on their findings all of them should be in jail. All it takes is requiring the upper level management of the agencies to live by GAAP and go to jail the same way a CEO would for violating GAAP. It would be fixed in less than 1 weeks. As for programming help. I can put 100 engineers to work for the government and within 1-2 have all their software programs talking and redesigned and working properly. / []
These people deserve some sort of an award for doing this, truly patriots / []
Given that the impression of many is that DODGE is not necesarily helping we should be a little more specific / ["In that way people do not just talk but they talk as we face facts    Don't you think?", 'I must say respectfully when I was in boots, there was so so much unecesary money spent no kidding, and it looked at those decades as if ALL was sustainable till debt started to acrued.

Thank you for all you do for our country to make America great again. May God continue to bless, guide and protect this wonderful team. / []
Elon Musk is now in charge of the billions of dollars the government has contracted with his companies. He's also got access to all the bidding information for all his competitors. He's also replacing government phone systems, air traffic systems, and others with products from his own companies. He has yet to prosecute a single fraudster -- but he sure acts like one. / []
American systems it's going to be running smoothly. Elon & Donald is a great team, billionaires founders need to come together. / []
If is interesting to watch the system dismantled by those that billions in government redistribution. / []
Elon please investigate the DMV in California. Not only is it unsanitary to be there waiting 4 hours while the woman have to use the mens restroom but the amount of money/taxes we have to pay is ridciculous. The dmv forms have Gavin Newsom name on them... please help us! / []
I think the solution to the tesla attacks is that elon needs to realize the democrat satanist political employees going on the news and internet 100% committing defamation and slander need to be personally sued and is indeed illegal. Not only will this curb most of it but that money can then be either used to refund the cost of the damage or put back into the government if he so chooses. This MUST happen and never does and I'm unsure why. Again.... I reiterate This MUST happen bc it's a constant issue across the board and must stop. / []
True Americans and truly responsible individuals set aside their personal interests to build a better future for the next generation. This is an incredible display of unconditional love and respect for both the people and the country. DOGE is an honorable organization, and I fully support it with all my heart. Thank you, Elon, and your team, for your great service! / []
Keep up the good job DOGE!! / []
Thank you so very much to the DOGE team and Elon Musk. I’m eternally grateful. / []

The perimeters of the city of Washington DC need to be re-drawn to include only U. S. government buildings and residences. All land occupied by regular residences and non-U.S. government businesses should be outside of those lines, and that land returned to the states from which they came. This will eliminate a lot of DC's problems, INCLUDING THE DC COURTS. / []
The reason this isn't shown across the networks is because they are all corrupt and have much to loose if corruption stops. These people are getting rich off of yours, your children's and even unborn children's backs. It's sickening to hear them lie and fear mongering to protect their corruption. America is awakening, and the woke will be put to sleep. / []
Wow the last line really hit me, I can’t comprehend how people are taking the moral high ground over any reasoning and logic. This is especially a problem in Germany. Can’t you guys see that there are real physical effects that another person is feeling while you feel good about your morality? / []
What about the government contracts that half of these guys are getting from the Fed? The government does need upgrading, but part of the reason that it isn't is because if these systems are hacked, it could drain everything for everybody.   I'm finding it really difficult to trust a literal group of billionaires that they are doing this because they care. Their whole life and job was always to get something back for their work, often orders of magnitude more.   The talk is right, but the actions aren't making any sense to me. The DOGE Twitter site has been inaccurate for months by missing commas and important details. Anybody care to chime in who is financial, systems or dev to shine light here?  I'm asking sincerely. The Government isn't suppose to be ran like a business, many departments are there as social services, which by design means operating at a loss such as the Military for example. / []
This interview is really refreshing. They all need to go on other networks and share... it should calm the narrative. / []
God bless AND protect everyone in this interview. / []
The Social Security Administration has been asking for money in the budget to upgrade their computer system for decades. Cutting their funding even further and firing their employees is not the best way to make sure that system gets updated. / []

Go ahead and digitize the data in the underground mine facility  for quicker processing, but don't get rid of the long-term storage on paper in the mine. That way if there's some sort of a computer systems failure, we can still get the information we need.   And no, don't upload it to the "cloud" as an alternative to keeping it in the mine. The cloud means it's easy to hack, and you've got lots of people's important personal information there. It would be a Goldmine for people wanting to commit ID theft. / []
I am so touched by these brave peoples / []
This was very informative, thank you for sharing, they need to shut down the dems propaganda, for the dems who are now millionaires, this is all about their slush funds / []
Get them all Elon get them all / []
This kind of process should happen every five years. I find it incredibly exciting and wish I could be involved. However, I do not think that technology is sufficient to save us. It is clear from the amount of corruption the DOGE team is finding, that the only thing which will save us is making better people through the Gospel of Jesus. / ['Amen to that! 🙌']
I agree with everything these guys say except for overstaffed issues…. One of the biggest problems in this country is corporations making 1 person do the job of multiple people without a pay raise… it’s disgusting and it needs to end / []
Don't be a coward Elon Musk. Go before the DOGE senate committee with receipts instead if this softball interview. / []
AMAZING interview....SHARING / []
I love all, my highest trust, respect, love, and reverence to you all. You all are America’s hero. 🩵🙏🇺🇸 / []

with great power comes great responsibility man  and the great responsibility is not only a financial one but it reflects in leadership too and great leadership needs great wisdom.. you seem to me that although you are very capable person, you are not so wise. / []

Hi All , Great comments from everyone. Lynnet 2044  below. . Good one. Yes, why don't all the media networks release this. Folks regardless of your politics if you Dems or Republicans. We as Americans need to get together and support WHAT THE DOGE TEAM ARE DOING. This is for the future of our children.  It's that simple. / []
Thank you Doge❤ / []
We need them for more than 120 days! Please extend it / []
Elon has a very very smart team and professional in what they do / []
Musk is a South African who will ruin our country while Trump and his $$ bros., Fleece the USA.😢 / []
This needs to be mandatory for state employees to watch! / []
Black Americans are desperately in need of a financial stimulus. Biden and Harris allocated innumerable dollars to immigrants seeking citizenship, illegally residing immigrants, and foreign governments.  Trump will be heralded in American history as the greatest POTUS ever by finishing what Abraham Lincoln started- giving the modern equivalent of 40 acres and 1 mule to every Black American male over the age of 35, that they might shepherd their household in natural prosperity and Biblical order. / []
What’s scary is, there are still people who are against this. And THAT’S a scary thought / []

But seriously, how CAN any honest person have anything but praise for DOGE exposing stuff like this??? Wouldn’t you WANT to know if your money was being used to fund a full salary for someone who literally doesn’t have a job but to sit there and do nothing but be able to say they are a government employee???   I try to have compassion for everyone’s different perspectives, especially politically… But I just have a really hard time seeing how anybody who is against DOGE isn’t either incredibly dishonest or unBELIEVABLY ignorant. / []
Appreciate  this interview  and how it was conducted / []
painful homework. lmao / []

To bad CNN or MSNBC or any other left leaning network wont have this team on to interview them so that both sides can see what they are trying to accomplish. / []
Just call grokshit on them all Elon. For those that don't know grokshit is the antonym of grok. / []
The Government has been a Cash Cow Piggy bank for decades, time to take control and hold people accountable. / []
The reason why there there is so much backlash is because Elon is the leader of DOGE’s efforts and it’s human nature to struggle with change. / []
It's pretty obvious that Fox News is part of the deep st@te (same applies to all legacy medias). That interviewer is trying to put a bad slant on the DoJE, but is failing miserably. / []
You guys need to understand these are employees who are inside the company that can approve it they are people who work in the social security office that are stealing the most / []

These guys are American financial heroes. The decisions are innovative business practices that private industry has always been under, so why not apply the science to government? It just makes sense. / []

Hard to believe people are complaining about DOGE.  These are brilliant people who are cleaning out excess and waste! / []
These leaders are so impressive, any Dems who oppose DOGE should be investigated for RICO / []
These guys are lying. If you think this is the gospel truth then why won't Musk go before Congress under oath and testify to these claims? I'm looking at the DOGE website right now and there are no receipts or explanations to support Musk's claims. Just numbers with zero source information. / []
This DOGE team is the definition of MERIT not DEI !!! MAGA🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []

Not a single democrat was informed in the making of this interview. / []
Thank you and God Bless you all! We are behind you 100% / []
They guys are really cool 😎 / []
Thank you Elon and team!!! / []
Elon and his team are a good decade ahead of everyone! They know that saving the country now keeps them here instead of moving elsewhere. Obviously they all love the country as well. They also know that revamping the system now is important because they will probably be running the whole thing in ten to fifteen years. Its inevitable. They have money the government does not, they have the ideas the government does not. Trump realizes this. People that have a vision. Dems have none. Real rubicon moment. Dems have no ideas, they have no solutions, the chasm that will grow as a result of tech and AI will be massive. Dems better start getting on board and for the betterment of the country.. Being anti Trump is not a solution or an idea. / []
Personally I have no thoughts on Elon it's just weird a non American having that much say in my country. Crazy how America was like get rid of all immigrants and then we promoted Elon like he's American blood 😂😂😂😂😂 .    ALSO IS ELONS COUNTRY ON OUR SIDE WEN IT COMES TO WAR ????????? like it matters America gonna take that shi too 😂😂😂.  Trump ur my president I got nothing to say u do u 😂 I'ma just sit here and agree with u 😂😂😂. / []

When it comes to savings, eight months is more than enough time to find a job. But besides that, people should be saving money, investing and preparing for retirement by themselves anyways. I know a lot of people don't, but that's only because they are absolutely irresponsible, ignorant and incompetent and its about time people call them out for it or else they will never learn and take accountability.", "@geneherald8169\xa0 its because minimum wage is still $7.25 hrly in some states. How do you save going paycheck to paycheck. I hope youre right that there are private sector jobs. The jobs these people had were dream jobs with benefits and retirement. That doesn't necessarily exist in the private sector. I just feel for all the parents children who are being left jobless. Some states are  pulling meals from schools and taking away finding for food pantries. Taking money out of farmers pockets that are subsidized to feed the hungry. None of this should affect childrens well being and it already is. It needs to be reconsidered by people who know what it's like to be poor.

Let's talk clearly here, they are doing all this because they don't want to lose their positions in the world, the power, and their money, because if the United States goes bankrupt or continues to lose more money, the time will come when their money will be worth nothing, that is, I'm glad that they do that because that benefits all citizens, but don't be good Samaritans, they do it more for their sake, which benefits us, that is, I don't care that they continue to do it for them to lose because they don't lose because it also benefits me and all American citizens.

Please fix VA Healthcare computer systems. They do not talk to each other from city to city. It causes major problems for a veteran due to having different diagnoses from center to center. Vets have to travel when there is NOT a hospital in their city. I had to travel thirty miles from my clinic ( my VA clinic does not take emergency or walk-ins) because my county hospital was NOT allowed a doctors referral from my VA doctor for treatment. / []

Elon has been called strange, weird etc. It’s because he’s different that makes him exceptional. His ability to block out the rhetoric and focus on results is commendable. Americans wake up!!  Elon is saving us from financial ruin. Turn off your politics and listen to the spend facts. EVERYONE should be supporting this effort.  The government is taking 40% of my families earnings. I for one am furious about the details of these expenditures coming out of my wallet.  HAVE AT IT ELON AND DOGE DUDES!!!  You have my full support and thanks! / []

I for one would like to thank every one of these gentlemen For their contribution To America Thank you very much gentlemen. / []
Good job Elon Musk you are doing really good. I appreciate you works. And your teams are Good Samaritan that have saved America from disaster, from wasteful spending. The democrats had let America down, they had deceived Americans for years, am so glad that your team brought transparency. / []
I pray everyone can watch this with open eyes and ears. These are amazing people trying to change the US and the world for the better. Hoping we unite as a country behind them so generations to come can live on and prosper in a world where good triumphs evil. / []

I wonder what is the average IQ of these people. Brilliant minds. / []
Beautiful! / []
All I can say for those of you who are upset with Elon and the other very very unimaginably wealthy individuals that are on the doge team is: at least you know where they reside within the political spectrum, they aren’t hiding who they are or what they stand for. The “Oligarchy” who is proud to be an American and wants America to thrive and is willing to put their name, and face behind is much more relieving than those who pull the string from behind closed doors and in the shadows of darkness. If you don’t believe or not even open to the idea that there are extremely wealthy individuals on the other side of the aisle that are pulling the strings then there is no way to ever come to a middle ground / []

Our Community is extremely supportive going out of their way to purchase through us and utilize our facilities. Working tirelessly 12-18 hours a day for 10 years,sacrificing time with my now adult children to support them to only become worse than we were 10 years ago from Excessive Taxes ,penalties ,Regulations never mind many denied attempts for loans to help us grow and create new jobs.

Wonderful work DOGE..  God bless you in your efforts. Very Greatful God put yall together.   GO Trump Administration.  Prayers daily for all of our Leaders. / []
I think they are doing great JOB. They are just cleaning the house. If you are clean, then you are clean right? If you are clean, what is dirty looks very obvious no? then if you can't see what is dirty then maybe you are too?  so maybe we have to check ourselves before say whatever... because I'm pretty sure, it's obvious what is stinky and dirty but many can't see? no? / []

You could even see the sadness in Elon's eyes at the end where he's talking about the loss of people. / []
When someone says buy Tesla cause he’s doing bad because people aren’t buying and Trump wants to help him. What about the one month social security check your mother in law wasn’t going to complain about? / []

Fear is why the SSA is getting all the calls and overloading the system.

I wonder if the guy in his pajamas and slippers seen vandalizing the Tesla in a parking lot realizes that car's owner is very likely a progressive, liberal Democrat just like him? And do the people attacking businesses with fire bombs, or the people celebrating those attacks, not see the irony? Their actions closely parallel what happened in Germany in the late 1930s. They're the violent fascists or the ones cheering for the fascists, yet that's what they call Trump and Musk.  George Orwell and Ayn Rand would say, "See. I told you so." / []

It would hold the media legally responsible to tell the truth. Obama changed the law in 2012, allowing the Media to lie to the public and protected them from any legal liability. / []
85-90 year old people or disabled are going to be very happy... aren't they? ICT Illiteracy is pretty widespread. Does this part of society be pushed at the fringe of society and be considered equal to 0? People living in rural areas or in the middle of nowhere are going to be happy? / []
No two ways about it. The debt is all stolen money. / []
If they have a great plan why spend time do this on tv lol I don’t tink is going well / []
This should be seen by everyone. / []
Elon, take my advice: shrug off EVERY criticism the lefties make about you! Although, you are not a poltician, you need to mantain that attitude! No sense of emotions! No deterrent!! Be bold faced, innocuous, inpenetrable, and keep face, even against the most outrageous remarks against you! Real politicians have no shame! No embarrassment!! You are doing great so far!! Unperturbed!!👍 / []
Thank you / []
Y'all just believe everything Elon Musk says without evidence. The propaganda machine is strong. / []
Who does Musk think he's talking to. This is America not South Africa and he should watch his mouth. If he thinks this is a Revolution, we won ours and if he wants another one, he doesn't understand Americans. We've already won. / []
Obama, Clinton and Biden all spoke about cutting the gov’t wasteful spending, but Trump is the only one doing it. 🎉 mama always said ‘talk is cheap. Actions speak louder than words’. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 the lefties crying about it speaks volumes about their integrity. / []
Thank you Mr.Musk keep up the good work. / []
You know the cRATS will just poo-poo this anyhow. It's all about cutting their free billion dollar rides. / []
And what about people who've been dooped disenfranchised by the corrupt states like here in Tennessee these Godless heathens took my liberty at age 18 years old and I've been locked up most of my life im 55 years old now I'm done these bastards here in Tennessee are abusive heathens who ruined my life literally, 18 years old i had a tax paying  Job went to court lost my job went to prison here in the horrible state of Tennesseefinishme  !!! / []
Who is big balls? / []
In all seriousness, I thank God that we have these guys. Nobody would run a business like the USA Govt has been running. If you deny that, you are mentally inadequate or you are lying to yourself. Good luck everyone / []
The Democrats are the party of criminals for the benefit of criminals. / []
I worked at a government state agency in education. We saw inefficiencies and duplicated costs CONSTANTLY. Now multiply that times thousands of federal agencies and departments across the nation. With our level of technology, it's just wasteful. Government employees justify it by saying they have to spend their budgets, its circulating money in the economy, etc. However we are getting federal funds from deficit spending. It's not sustainable. / []
The question is, why isn’t doge revealing trumps financial crimes during his presidency 😂 / []
Has one politician or fraudster gone to prison yet? / []
I agree, Mark Kelly is a traitor.  He is currently taking the opposite side of the president, on behalf of a foreign nation to continue world war 3. / []
Outstanding! / []
Big thank you to Mr. Elon Musk and the Team! / []
GOD bless these Patriots! Save our hard earned tax $$$ please… / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE for your love for America and your service. May God protect you! / []
What was that noise at the end / []
What is Elon solution to Ukraine war ? Surrender?, which can lead to more sacrifices of young lives in the future . / []
MAGA what a blessing ❤about time Bless America always and our President with his wonderful team ❤ / []
I have a question: I am not a retiree, but is there a way to look up my social security number to make sure my social sec isn't being tapped by fraudsters? / []
Much needed briefing thank you / []
I am actually very surprised at this group! I thought it was comprised of much younger,  less experienced people.  Amazing! / []
They are wasting time going after discretionary spending. That is pennies on the dollar. The big hitters are military, Medicare and social security. The discretionary waste elimination is just to help his businesses. The military industrial complex wont allow him to touch their $$ / []
When Musk and his team has done the job there they can come to Sweden and clean out all the corruptions!!❤❤ / []
Hold people responsible for lies! / []
It's wild how outdated the Gov tech stack has become. Skipped a few updates, but great time to upgrade! / []
This interview should have been done a month ago!  It's fantastic, but they really need to do a better job of marketing DOGE. If every American saw this they would be in favor of what they are doing / []
This is worth watching more than once. This DOGE group of men are an awesome group it's pretty apparent why they are doing it. Bret could have asked better questions. / []
Thank you Elon, and team!! / []
I love Elon / []
Probably the sys tree an were designed this way to lander tax $$$ I it special interests / []
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Thank you DOGE!! You have my support. / []
Back when Regan was in  charge, he invited  to make suggestions for government improvements.  Very few were adopted, unfortunately.. but one guy wrote a book about  it. / []
Why are there no critical questions? / []
God bless these men 🙏🇺🇸 / []
dont put israel above the US dont be traitor / []
Go after the  government contractors,  start with Intercon Security,  $662 million to provide guards at the State Dept. Building and Passport offices / []
Incredible.  Astonishing.  So glad Brett did this interview as it answers  many questions for the public.  Everyone needs to watch this. / []
which dude is big balls? Im a fan / []
Also, where is all the savings from the most fraudulent department of them all...the Defense Department?  If you don't make massive cuts there, everything DOGE does means nothing. / []
Dear white privileged males, pay equal tax as the working class and cap your pay according to your own employees. You are hypocritically speaking regarding  frivolous spending. We could cast and broadcast a new series “Hoarders, the 1%” / []
The fedral workers !!!youe kidding ....sounds like job security to me..  Elon Musk and h8s team should take a real good look at the DOT.. / []
The cuts save but the fixes cost what, nothing? What’s the cost of destroying the system with no systems in place? What’s the cost of disrupting the current economy on a whim?  Elon is a military contractor. Why isn’t the military ground zero for Doge?  Who will get the contracts to upgrade the systems? Why isn’t this laid out? / []
Gosh! Love these men!  Thank you so much! / []
Bottom line…the government doesn’t need as much of our money as they say…it can run on waaaaaay less and with waaaaay less people. Less is more. Rush taught us early on that our government is too big, nothing like our forefathers intended. Our government needs to get out of the way of the American people and their way of life! Our money has gone to make the politicians billionaires for doing NOTHING! Wake up, Americans!!! Smaller the  government the more of your hard earned dollars you keep! Thank you, President Trump, Elon Musk and the Doge soldiers! / []
Mark Kelly is very arrogant and is okay with the continued destruction of the US.  He and Gallego are not representative of the state of Arizona and are reflective of a corrupt election process here. / []
Make it make cents / []
Elon is wrong about one thing. It's not propaganda being pushed by the far left. It's your everyday Democrat friend and neighbor with extreme hate in their heart for President Trump and Elon Musk. / []
Watching from Europe, you Americans really crazy 🙈 How in the hell this is possible ? Looks like bank which loaded every day with no security and anyone can call in at any time 😂Just take as much you need and come back tomorrow 😁By the way Trump probably saw this already last term, but for some reason kept quiet 🙈 / []
This is brilliance on display. They are saving our country from financial implosion / []
Hat off / []
Pentagon got $12 billion  for submarines. No submarines  were built and Pentagon don’t know where the money went! / []
Demonrats never changed nor wanted changes because it was easy for them to steal with an old system! They're pissed and fighting this because they're no longer getting anything or a lot less! Rotton thieving demonrats and some Rinos! / []
Virtue for 3 dollar sack of soil amen. Discusting / []
Nice try and great acting guys! / []
Crazy how people feel a rocket scientist is not qualified to do a simple audit shows how ignorant America has become / []
The world will adopt this kind of style DOGE / []
Thank you, God, for bringing light to the darkness of the US Government!  🙌❤️🙏 / []
Incredible stuff. / []
Does this mean my hundred and forty seven year old uncle won’t receive his monthly Social Security retirement? / []
I knew this planet about to be destroyed at once but I didn't know it's come soon and the guy will be a South African Apartheid kid / []
So which one is “Big Balls”?   Keep up the great work and sacrifice guys, appreciate the effort! / []
Oversight, oversight!! 👊🏽👊🏽 / []
Do you remember when 5 billion dollars for a wall was absolutely impossible😂😂😂😂 keep cutting your food taster might need to hire a food taster God bless this initiative and God bless Trump / []
Thank God for Doge and President Trump. / []
Since 2008.... / []
Mistakes, is 38 billion dollars in subsidies, paid to Elon Musk with taxpayer’s dollars a mistake?Has Elon Musk even offered to reduce was is basically welfare for billionaires.Has the temple of worship to billionaires. Ever realized, that billionaires outsourced thousands of American jobs for decades. The tax cuts that are included in the budget plan. Extends Trump’s tax cuts of basically for the wealthy donor who donate hundreds of millions in campaign contributions to both parties. By extending the tax cuts for years. Will add trillions to the deficit and reduce tax revenue by trillions.Trump’s original plan was to make the tax cuts for wealthy donors permanent. Which is like Project 2025 on steroids. All that has to watched,down the road. Is the nation debt. So far the nation debt has increased by billions in February. If each month goes by. There are months that the debt is increasing. Then these wealthy billionaires donators. Will see their the foundation of their temple of worship start to crumble… / []
This needs to be broadcast across all media platforms so Americans can see for themselves the change among us / ['Never happen..free sh*t and victimhood isn’t a part of this work…that’s a Democrat way of management…', 'Exactly, how can you hear that 15 million over the age of 120 years old and think that your retirement and daily income, livelihood is not at risk? 12:29', 'well...SHARE IT.....ya know you told 2 friends they  tell 2 friends  etc..!!  I DID..!!  i suggest   EVERYONE    SHARES THIS  ASAP.!', 'That will never happen and you know it.']
Elon musk is a legend you lefties are ungrateful 😤 / []
Thank the Lord for these hero’s! / []
The DOGE team is amazing!  This is transparency!   I applaud each of these people (Elon's Team) for all that they are doing to expose the truth!! / ['How can this comment only have 3 likes?!?!? Youtube??']
May God bless musk and the whole team thank you for all the hard work / []
This is actual reality 😅 government employees have been reporting it for years and they are ignored, fired for whistle blowing and this is actually how things work / []
There’s no way Elon speaks that fluently without stutters, this must’ve been like 300 hours of footage edited. / []
❤ / []
This is transparency unlike what has been seen before. / []
Technically this is not a bad thing / []
Anyone against this movement is just braindead. / []
Nobody needs you to stop to tell us what you’re fixing to speak about! How annoying, who tf come up with that just play the interview / []
Didn't the Wall Street scam guy who now works for the FBI use dead people's social security numbers to get loans on property? / []
Salute our pillars❤❤❤ / []
Thank you, gentlemen. / []
These people had access to funds at will with no reason why they need it that’s crazy / []
Baffling. SMH / []
I appreciate everything the "DOGE" has and is doing for the people! / []
Maybe if you watch a different channel, you will be informed / []
I genuinely believe Musks heart is in the right place however the country is broke we're all broke with one leg to stand on where is the money where has all the money gone does one family need 20 trillion dollars to survive how is this sustainable it's ridiculous we're not playing with monopoly money when are the adults going to get involved and give us some money to fix our cars and fix our situations / []
Thank you Mr Musk for sacrificing to rebalance Americas balance sheet . / []
Mathew 21;12-13❤❤❤ / []
Doge isn't done until there are indictments of those who pocketed tax dollars / []
I suspect mass persecution is coming it why the democrats are panicking. / []
Great team, keep up the great work, truth always prevails!!! / []
Evil. Evil. Evil. Evil foul gargoyle. Evil foul loathsome little cockroach. / []
Everyone in America should see this truly amazing.. 100% 👏👏👏 / []
He will make Trump 2 a disaster and GOP will lose midterm after losing lot of goodwill. / []
Elon Musk, do you really think making peace with Putin will save lives? History has shown that appeasing Russia only strengthens its regime, which has already been responsible for the deaths of millions—even outside of war. Just look at Georgia, where 20% of the country remains occupied by Russia. The atrocities committed there when they cut children’s head and play football and  Other atrocities committed in Ukraine prove that force is the only language Putin understands. Strength is the only way to deter further aggression. If world leaders fail to act decisively, they are not only endangering global security but also crushing any hope for democracy and freedom in Russia itself. You are Geo politically dysfunctional and you are creating an enormous dangerous world for tomorrow! / []
God bless America! / []
A good man / []
No.... dont take my big beatuufy welfare in my country usd last longer. So I moved further from the bank so I could laugh longer.   I haven't worked for 20yrs im not about to start now. Mate. / []
Excellent interview. DOGE all the way! ❤ / []
Aoc, Kimmel, Pelosi, walz and on and on.  Are responsible for the violence / []
The fraudster are surely illegal immigrant fro NAPLES .... hahahaha / []
Excellent interview / []
This isn’t fiscal responsibility. It’s authoritarianism in a hoodie — funded by taxpayers, powered by disinformation, and aimed at dismantling democracy from the inside out. WAKE UP / []
we will not go to bit coin.. so stop forcing it / []
Every American should have to watch this presentation, including every child from three years up, and please include all the congressmen and Democratic senators / []
Get this mana cape! Hero’s need capes / []
Elon is fked / []
God bless them for doing what others were to afraid to do / []
We will end up being the most technically Advanced government in the world after Doge gets done engineering all the systems for efficiency / []
Undermining Trust in Institutions When Social Security websites crash or checks are delayed, they blame “the old system” — not their own interference. This erodes faith in government — paving the way for privatization and fascism-lite. / []
Attacks on Public Education and History Trump’s allies are already pushing laws to control school curricula — banning honest education about race, history, and even science. A privatized government opens the way to total control of the national narrative. / ['There is no attack on Education. It pushes power to the states, so if you have a problem with what is being taught, take it up with your state board. Giving away federal power is the opposite of total control.']
Chainsaw billionaire is having fun at the cost of the public and the country. Creating chaos all around. All the statistics are without evidence. Trying to create a hype based on half truths. / ['Dumb comment... Why does he need publics money when he is the richest man on earth? Are you living in this earth that everyone is living? Most of the liberals are living in lala land. How about you speak about the corruption that left ran for 4 years... You people are a disgrace and blind eyed by CNN and MSNBC...', 'Have you been to the website?']
The sad problem is the amount of abuse they are getting from individuals who do not understand why this must happen, and soon.    And, the value these men are providing the US is grossly underappreciated.  The combination of the opposition media and the Democrats willingness to spread m mistrust and misinformation is doing a great disservice to America. / []
Thank you, DOGE TEAM! You are saving our country from corruption. Keep going and don't stop. I speak for all the Americans who love this country. You're right. The people against you are either SHEEP, swayed, or controlled by others through psychological tactics and persuasion techniques (AKA: Democrats), or the actual culprits; The ones who are actually taking American taxpayers hard earned money. Again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. / []
Surveillance and Data Consolidation Centralizing data under unelected tech oligarchs opens doors to mass surveillance and suppression. / []

"PRESIDENT Donald J.TRUMP Has Assembled A Dream Team Administration That Is Watching Out For The AMERICAN TAXPAYING CITIZEN!!!" ❤ "BRING BACK MADE IN THE USA!!!" Just Saying!!!❤❤❤🎉 / []
❤🎉God is in control! / []
Funny how democrat higher ups keep talking about needing surveys, studies. / []
How evil are the Democrats for opposing this and doing everything they can to impede them😡 / []
This mirrors authoritarian moves in places like Russia, Turkey, and Hungary: privatize the government, rewrite history, control information, and defund opposition. / []
Just imagine if Kamala would have won... / []
Democrats are corrupt lying fools. / []
Musk’s Subsidy Hypocrisy Musk owes his fortune to taxpayer-funded subsidies: $4.9 billion in government aid for Tesla, SolarCity, and SpaceX. Lucrative contracts with NASA and the Pentagon. He built an empire on public money — and now wants to cut the safety net for everyone else. / []
I wish all the people who don't understand what they are really doing would watch this! But no, they rather watch the lying Democrats. You know the ones probably getting the money. / []
The number of comments praising Elon and DOGE is laughable.  Here’s an idea, why don’t you wait for a tangible benefit to you as an American first, or are just buying into the hype?  The republicans budget resolution increased spending to the Pentagon.  Of course, Elon is not looking there with his government contracts when the Pentagon has been the least accountable department with their spending.  It’s a joke. / []
Wow! Amazing! / []
Just remember everyone not to get too angry because these things are a natural phenomenon of life in general because even the most honest person still has a good probability of greed if given the opportunity.  The fault may be given to some of the worst actors at the top but in general it's everyone's fault in the country because we didn't stand up when we should have. But that's still too much blame to put on us all.  The unfortunate truth is that this couldn't have happened when it was needed because that's not how life works And if you want to confirm if what I say is true  just look at your own decisions you've made and changes you've made and especially the ones that you should have changed and you haven't yet. It's exactly the same thing / []
Where’s the waste-cutting when it comes to military contractors, Space Force boondoggles, or Musk’s own government-subsidized ventures? Nowhere. / []
Iraq war: 2.4 trillion USD. Direct subsidies to fossil fuel industries: 20 billion USD / year. / []
On Ukraine I would say if USA was illegally invaded wouldn’t USA defend itself? That is exactly what Ukraine is doing. It’s not for nothing Elon. / []
Stealing American ssn is a fact / []
Selective Cuts – But Not for the Pentagon Not a word about cutting the $880 billion Pentagon budget. Yet they’re happy to “fix” retirement paperwork, which has zero effect on national debt. / []
We need this in CANADA!!!!! Clean our corrupt government!!!! / []
While everyone is human only the best humans can do the things that need to be done. The stealing of our country acrossed all aspects is over. We are Americans. America first! / []
The problem is that they are lying. They are not going to decrease the deficit or the debt. Trump is asking for a 4 TRILLION dollar increase in the debt ceiling in order to pass tax cuts that will mainly go to the people sitting on that panel and their billionaire boys club. So please remember as they cut free school lunches, personnel from the VA, the IRS, the forest service and on an on that they are lying about efforts to cut the deficit/debt but taking from middle class to give to billionaires through government contracts and tax breaks. / []
This interview was well needed. I hope people really see what's going on and how this helps / []
Wow that was awesome, thruth, great dialogue and answers that should satisfy ANYONE. I hope the ppl doing harm or organising, paying for harm to Tesla never see freedom again / []
Holy...Cow...  This video should be constantly and continously be shared in every social source possible. / []
Put white men in charge and everything starts running smoothly again... **sighs in superiority** / []
shocking someone can just sit there and lie thru their teeth / ['So the left is not lying at all?😂😂😂 You ppl are brainwashed through CNN and MSNBC']
Came here for the comments. I wanted to see how my fellow Americans were responding!!! I love what DOGE is doing!!! ❤❤❤❤ / ['👍🇺🇸']
Privatization Under the Guise of Efficiency This isn’t just about fixing outdated tech. It’s about turning government over to billionaires and Silicon Valley. / []
Thank you Elon and team, thank you PDJT!  Thinking about what's next, could we look at revolutionizing the auto and home insurance cabal?  I know the middle men will hate me for suggesting it, but why are our premiums increasing, benefits decreasing, and insurance company's profits skyrocketing? / []
Having chills watching The DOGE TEAM God bless y'all / []
Please pay attention to the owners of cellular phone and computer companies.  I can tell you the stuff I have “been shown”.  Talk about scamming.  Geeshhhhh / []
IS THERE AT LEAST ONE DEMOCRAT WHO REPRESENTS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NOT THE OLIGARCHYS ! / []
Just completing this DOGE project will make America stronger! / []
Awesome 🎉 / []
Elon don’t you think you should blame Putin for that? Ukrainians are on their own land defending their own home. They didn’t start this war! / []
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist it just takes someone who is not a career politician/criminal / []
These bunch of "19" year olds are the oldest i have seen in my life. Actually they are the smartest 19 years old not just in America but the world over. 😂😂😂😂 / []
So numbers keep getting thrown around in the Billions of savings but DOGE says 130B of savings. Why is there a such a disparity in what is being reported and what DOGE says? I want to see trillions in reduction. / []
One million credit cards more than federal employees? 😮 / []
It’s amazing, if the left built this same team, it would be on every channel and they’d all be geniuses. But TDS and now EDS is limiting it to just Fox and the left is turning to violence. Legit some of the brightest minds/leaders doing work to make our country better. Heros / []
Thank you DOGE for what you are doing!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
I love that they are in the fake oval office doing this interview 😂 / []
Democrats and RINOs do NOT want to stop the wasteful spending / []
I have found  this interview very informative!  I agree  that this has to be shown to all the people that make comments without facts and listen to  the rhetoric of the democrats.  I thank Trump and Elon and the DOGE team who are working tirelessly to save our country! / []
It would be helpful to see the fraudsters being arrested. / []
They are SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY! / []
Thank you Elon and your Doge team for all that you are doing to save our country from all of the corruption. May God bless you all. / []
This is the greatest act of patriotism of my entire life. God bless each and everyone of you. You are all great Americans thank you for your service. God bless America and God bless the American citizen. / []
Fox cut a few bits out.... / []
Note: All white men. Because if you want experts, they're all white men. / []
Who doesn't agree or, like Elon Musk, must be jealous of him. / []
Worth watching and listening to / []
And you won't see this kind of interview on MSNBC, because Fox is far right propaganda... right? / []
I feel really good that they are working to save money.  The supposedly richest country in the world is 36 trillion in debt.  Unbelievable / []
They talk but where are the examples and documentation ?? / []
So happy with the plain language / []
Elon is awesome. We are lucky to have him 🙌 / []
You know, it's really easy for you to say this when you have billions of dollars to keep you fed and healthy keep your homes running smoothly never have to worry about your car tearing up because you can afford any kind of car you want while we the people who made all your riches possible sit in poverty and uncertainty way to go good job . / []
Will our prosperity go up? obv no. looks like just word salad to prevent the scam to make a bigger scam. / []
Thank you DOGE!  We were on the doorstep of becoming Greece 2.0.  It is my prayer that you have great success! / []
Wow. If US govt is this inefficient, I can't imagine how awful my 3rd world country govt might be. My country already copy/emulate DOGE, forming a govt organization to cut cost and streamline the govt, I hope they will find success. / []
Ok, something is not adding up? Americans get taxed every paycheck! At a low estimate of 8 trillion a year being taken out for taxes! That is not counting the ones abroad.  This is at a minimum of 350 million Americans. The true deficit should be a lot lower. Unless there is a lot of Embezzlement by the Senate, Congress, and the federal agencies. Than each one needs to be held accountable! 8 trillion a year of hard earned money being taken out. We should not even be in a deficit! / []
to save money just stop spending for 1 year your money will grow u start get out of your 22 trillion deficit but if go to war with Canada then 3x the deficit. / []
Imagine trusting billionaires. Billionaires who won't be affected by these cuts. Billionaires that won't be affected by rising costs. / []
Elon be smart don't take more money over power, you will have control over that countries government that is 50 Million if you 850 Million so that is 900 Million per year that is a lot of money already....!!! / []
God bless our true President Elon 🇺🇸 / []
36:57 what does that sound like in the background? / []
Why is this idiot allowed to mess with the government? Doesn't he have actual things to do? He has no experience in government. And private business has almost nothing to do with what the government's mission is. / ["That is a rediculous statement. They are trying to save our country. If you haven't noticed our country is bankrupt."]
I love this so much ❤❤❤❤ / []
I've worked on Gov IT systems for 20+ years.  They're not lying.  I used to work on one system that was so old...we could only get parts off eBay if some old system popped up. / []
Thank GOD that this interview happened. We NEED DOGE to continue! / ['well...SHARE IT.....ya know you told 2 friends they  tell 2 friends  etc..!!  I DID..!!  i suggest   EVERYONE    SHARES THIS  ASAP.!']
Get a list of the best running companies, create a panel for consultancy services.  Aka I’m sure that’s what this team is. / []
Elon Musk the best. / []
I love what DOGE is doing with our money.  It’s something any responsible person should be doing with their own finances.  Unfortunately our elected officials have been spending it as if it’s Monopoly money with no consequences.  Sadly when it came to the Treasury discussion I was alarmed when he said we want to model it after the private sector.  To that I say NO THANKS!  In the private sector specifically the finance world these Golden Parachutes and bonuses are disgustingly outrageous.  And if they are applied to Treasury it will defeat the purpose of savings.  And finally deep down I get a funny feeling about this process, and that is the intention of why Trump and Musk are so fired up to reduce this waste….  My thoughts are their efforts are self serving for their own benefit when it comes to their taxes.  What I like to see is a flat rate income tax.  And a federal sales tax.  Because the only people who pay taxes are non criminals.  But criminals buy stuff, so there they will get taxed. / []
Lol, spectacular / []
This was the best, most informative interview 👏 / []
God bless Elon and Team DOGE team! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 / []
Shake, rattle, and roll! Thankful for this team! We are being blessed! / []
The Air Force uses a military pay system from 1969.  Looks like the matrix. / []
Dems are such disgusting liars. / []
We british are in our Biden period right now with starmer and labour ,I hope we get our own doge and get our country back on track. See you at the top soon my American brothers and sisters. / []
Mark Kelly IS A TRAITOR and completely incompetent! I lived in AZ when he was elected and it was a SAD moment to say the least!! 💩 / []
Musk has already been shown that he is way off by the numbers & misunderstood how certain systems worked. He has no idea & is just throwing big numbers around. / []
Murica! / []
This is just incredible!! ❤❤❤ / []
Nailed it / []
You can see the desperation and ketamine in Elon's eyes / []
Real Americans right here! God bless you and your families. Thank you for your service. And please go after those evil villains. / []
I think this country has a better chance going bankrupt than it does with a man worth $400 billion running the head of Dodge. Elon Musk has made his money off the backs of every day working Americans he’s not an every day working American. Corporations and the ultrarich need to be as far away from politics as we could possibly keep them, that’s the real problem in this country. / []
People need to view both sides then youll really see what imformation is omitted. Doge has a lot of good intentions that are pointed out here and sounds awesome. But i encourage you to find the real impacts of some of there unperfect "batting average" as elon likes to dumb it down to. Get perspective and really see the truth both side are liars and cheats. / []
God bless you Elon musk :D / []
How does one disagree with this? Obama even wanted something like this when he was elected. This will put more money in our pockets. Yes sacrifices will be made upfront, but for the better. Reduced risk. / []
These  fools can easily help the economy without hurting their pockets they are billionaire. But they would rather take the money from the working people. / []
One of the best interviews in a very long time, thank you! / ['Brett did a great job!!', 'well...SHARE IT.....ya know you told 2 friends they  tell 2 friends  etc..!!  I DID..!!  i suggest   EVERYONE    SHARES THIS  ASAP.!', 'That right Rick', '@MarieKleesyes he did 👍', '@Rick3Freedom can we get to know each other better']
130 days are not enough. Add another 130 days to make sure the changes stick. imho. / []
Excellent interview!! / []
Just because you’re not a government official doesn’t mean that you can’t bring in some very beneficial paradigm shifts and ideas that the government doesn’t know about or utilize. I think it’s an awesome idea because these government officials that have been in there for so long have gotten complacent and they’re doing the same thing and they don’t like change And there you go. / []
Musks comment caring about the usa over another country he should keep the same standard for israel… but no because apaic is too strong / []
DOGE is when we ask if high level intelligent people, with hopefully positive intentions, could help lead America. This is finally our chance. Smart people don’t want to be corrupt politicians. / []
All white men. Go figure. / []
Why blame the Biden administration if this is true then it’s been that way all through many presidential administrations INCLUDING Trumps first term…. Stop trying to scapegoat one administration when clearly (if true) it happened on the watch of Trump and others in years prior?? Y’all want to paint things you should paint them all not just throw paint on one person’s 4 year term. / []
Elon hit the nail on the head. The far left is pushing propaganda and their far left supporters are doing the work they want done. They don't want to be held criminally responsible for these acts. But they want them to happen. They want Trump and Elon killed. If they don't stop fanning the flames eventually someone will be hurt their easily could be an attack on the people the left call their enemies that ends in the end of a human life. Then what ? You can't bring them back and now they are pointing at these leftists leaders who were feeding their propaganda to the masses. I don't think they care 🙄 / []
You don’t scare American people that’s where you’re making mistake. You continue to speak like that to Americans and unfortunately you’re gonna pay worse price. / []
I certainly appreciate you and your doge team , thanks Elon.😊 / []
I can care less what they fix or don't fix.  What i care about is accountability.  Who is getting held accountable / []
This is one of the best and most needed interviews yet!!  This team should do the same for the liberal media outlets as well. / []
Elon Musk is the smartest person in the world and nicest man alive , we should appreciate his wisdom and honesty. / []
This is amazing! / []
LOTS OF TALK FROM PRES MUSK BUT < WITHOUT ANY PROOF AS OF YET >>>> / []
I fully support DOGE auditing the government spending and getting our tech systems running better but I wish our defense team would do an over haul on the grid system that all this tech runs on. / []
Who is Musk to lecture Ukrainians, he says nothing about evil Putin smh. / []
Thank you ALL !!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌 / []
Democrats tend to accuse republicans of everything they actually are!! / []
the crime has become digitised, thats a reason why not to digitise our files. / []
Keep up the great work you are doing, DOGE talented team! / []
Great show / []
Honestly in awe watching these heroic genuises trying their damndest to save this country. We all owe these great men a debt of gratitude as will our children's children if DOGE is successful. 🫡 / []
This is the fault of the Democrat voters! Boy are they dumm! The Brandons have RUINED the country. Voting Democrat is an evil act / []
Democrats want broken, antiquated government systems and processes so they can keep gaming and frauding the taxpayers. / []
It seems the whole “problem” with Elon musk is that he’s exposing/embarrassing the spending of the last administration / []
Democrats tend to accuse republicans of everything they actually are!! / []
History being made! WOW Go USA! Leading the free world. May God be with you all! / []
Great interview fir transparency.  Beyond shameful the waste! / []
Listen to my words a bio pic will be made on DOGE / []
FANTASTIC GOOD NEWS / []
This should be required viewing for every American. If this was any other admin this would seem like propaganda, but I truly believe Elon and his team are trying to save the government from itself 🇺🇸 / []
Good luck DOGE / []
You guys seem to like Dr in front of their name and people elevated in rank and commission. This does not mean they know what they're doing, or are good people. Definition of good people. Doing what's right for the American people. Given freely of their time to fix a problem that was not theirs. To look out for the next generation. These people in Doge do not need the problems that Congress and judges are causing for them. Doge hid them in the  pocketbook that's why they're screaming so loud / []
He literally retweets white supremicists / ['Just because someone is a whitesupremicist doesnt mean that that person is wrong about everything in life', 'Nasa hired nazis, dont see you boycotting nasa']
America is going great and safe, great team of Donald Trump.  Wish we had someone in UK, a Donald Trump team. / []
Good work . Use that money saved to help build simple halls with kitchen and washroom. / []
Introducing AI 🤖 / []
What will be amazing if CNN reporter and fox reporter sitting together and ask questions! People will love that! / []
Immigrants for Trump 🇱🇧🕊️🇺🇸 / []
Dodge is fine...but lets not attack the middle class...the real saving are from the greedy corporations, tax breaks for top 5%, and stimuluses for corporations. currently he's taking from the bottom 90% of the populations, in order to fund the new tax breaks for the top 10%. Full Stop! End of story. Trickle down does not work. / []
Mhwahahaa 12.25 15 million over the age of 120 years old  active on social security, there's ya 2020 Biden voters. Keep it up Elon. / []
Great team.. Thank you for all they are doing. I have worked in finance and these guys are spot on. / []
I get what these DOGE guys are saying and agree with the things they are saying, but how many CIOs or Marketing Officers is the right number for a Department as big as Human and Health --- 1, 2, 10.  And how do they DOGE guys calculate this. / []
29:00 this is the real "OPSEC" crisis that the government existed under for over 3 decades. Jesus save us. / []
Thank you thank you, why couldn’t 60 Minutes do this interview so everyone can hear this. So sad that the Main Street will not air this. / []
I’ve worked for the government they are so wasteful it’s insane / []
Outstanding Video!!! This truly is the BIGGEST "Revolution" since the "ORIGINAL" Revolution. / []
Hysterical! Elon says it's essential he doesn't say patriotic! Cuz he does not give a s*** about us here in this country essential for his pocket / []
They sure are talking a good game. 😂 / []
Doge is amazing.. thank you bless you all. We patriots appreciate you all.. 👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏 / []
❤ Thank all of you for saving America!  Accountability and upgraded technology❤ yet Please keep AI out of government. / []
Thank god / []
There will be people who say because this was on Fox it's untrue. So then I say okay if this were on CNN you would then believe it? If this was being posted by Rachel Maddow you would then believe it? This is why I have zero tolerance for the woke-minded left idiots. I won't even engage them. It's futile and not worth my time because I have much more important things to move on to in my world. / []
Brett, love your ensemble . There’s more good out  there. But these accomplished men are the grand- fathers who do the hardest for all of us. Elon is fighting evils & God has Elon’s back. That goes also for everyone in the panel & their families. Lot praying for you. / []
Show the REAL Doge team please lol / []
This is good to know.  I say out with the old and in with the new. I’m referring to technology. / []
Honestly, I’m tired of hearing about this all the money they found should be given back to the American taxpayers / []
Look at these group of magnificent caring and devoted people to the American people! It is ashame that they are being treated and slander on a daily basis instead of celebrate! If people slandering would have to pay for the time the other side need to spend + fine for hurting the reputation personal and business/financial they would have think twice before opening there mouths!  I hope this will infect the rest of the world and countries!  Thanks to the people of DOGE!❤❤❤👏🙏 / []
Thank you, DOGE.  Great work.  I hope DOGE becomes a permanent fixture in government.  Sincerely, a former democratic. / []
Elon be last person to notice rolling,  rolling within motions. What would a business owner especially within volume nominal know towards this catagory. / []
I challenge the running myth that government is inefficient. What are we comparing it to? If we are comparing it to a business its size , it is incredibly more efficient than a fortune five hundred company. Yes, the systems need to be upgraded and there could be some process improvements. Those are no reason to circumvent our democracy. The waste is truly in Electing corrupt leaders with conflicts of interest who in the end are working towards their own selfish agendas under the guise of making government efficient. / []
South Africa needs DOGE and Trump. In fact, TRUMP should be a GLOBAL PRESIDENT!!! / []
The degenerates setting fire to Tesla dealerships don’t care about the national debt. At all. They’re infants. / []
It’s refreshing to listen to smart people for a change - smart people seem so few and far between and here is a whole group / []
Thank you Elon and Mr Trump.. saving America dispute the looney lefties.. bravo gentleman.. bravo..🙏🙏👏👏👍👍 / []
Where’s the DOGE team lead?? / []
I love it which happened in that one case oh it's not millions of people like you're saying! You frauds You're the frauds / []
TORNADOES WILL BE DESTROYING PLAYSTATION LIVES / []
I standby these guys even if there are mistakes. Because they have goals and methods. I trust them. / []
This guy and his doge team of duchebags have no business medling in the US fiscal arena. This is no longer a Dem vs Rep issue anymore. It's a people vs. the billionaires issue. / ['Do the number of cats you own match the number of meds you take? Totally curious 🤔']
This is theft- I want my money back from the last 40 years of working- I will take greater care of my own retirement plans! / []
I am a democrat. I agree with the government cuts, because they just spend too much money.  The issue with the layoffs is the disrespectful way it was done. Like it was a joke to them.  That was and is not ok.  A lot of people lost their jobs. So show them some decency and compassion. I was laid off once because my company got bought up. It was challenging for me - even when I had another job offer right away- but I really appreciate that the company thanked us when we left for all the good work we did during the transition. / []
These folks are patriots!  democrats are against them because it damages their crime organization.  These trillion dollar democrat crimes require severe prosecution. / []
Amazing, without the expertise of the DOGE team, no one else can help the government modernize the system, identify fraudulent transactions and expedite the processes needed by for the retirement of the American people.  Democrats should cooperate and be thankful enough. / []
Wow, our AMERICAN HEROES 🥰 / []
I am a federal employee and I love every bit of this. Thank you DOGE TEAM! Thank you President Trump! / ['I just want to thank you personally for your dedication.', 'What do you actually like that they do? Actual facts or just emotion?', 'And you are also the Queen of Romania.', 'Just wait until it’s you.', '@jstandards766 bot']
Thank You Elon & Go Trump❤️... The laws of physics is: it will get worse before it gets better, meaning many bad will get fired before it gets better.... So let Elon & Trump do their Job🙏 amen / []
Thank goodness, finally an administration that has the guts to do this. / []
I Love hign IQ person design new nation / []
If private companies are using new technology, why not federal and estate government update their processes! DOGE is doing a great job! / []
Thank you Elon and Doge!! 🇺🇲♥️ / []
The Founding Fathers would be ashamed at what this country’s government has come to… / []
What a great job the DODE is doing.👏 Clinton and Obama didn’t ride DOGE hard enough, but Trump and his team is, so thank you Mr. Musk.🙏🏼 / []
It literally takes rocket scientists to get this done 😂 / []
What a fantastic job this brilliant team is doing in spite of activist judges & obstructionist Dems who hate our country - God bless Elon & the DOGE patriots! / []
Thank God, we have these incredible men doing this. Our country is in extremely good hands. / []
On behalf of all Americans, even the ungrateful idiots, thank you for what you are doing 🇺🇸💪🏻 / []
Thank you all!! Can’t imagine what would have happened to this country without you. / []
Amen Elon😢😢😢 / []
We should make a Doge in every civilized country and then we will really see how politicians spend our money on futile things. Now we understand well why taxes are always increasing and never decreasing. The entire political class is co-responsible for signing laws that instead of rationalizing spending create further debt. And then they come to talk to us about sacrifices to be made etc etc. / []
wow really awesome interview... Now if we can just get this aired for the radicals to see. Until we address this issue of a financially supported narrative I don't ever see UNITY in our future. / []
Are the fraudulent funds being tracked to the person that authorized it and will they be prosecuted? / []
DOGE does a very Good Job / []
Social Media should be saturated with this video!!! This should be plastered everywhere! / []
Brett, you are WONDERFUL and THANK YOU so much for allowing the panel of experts to reveal what is ACTUALLY happening at DOGE. I NEVER doubted the thought process of President Trump, but am now MUCH more knowledgeable to push back on the idiotic rhetoric and outright LIES of anyone saying anything different about what's really going on. / []
if you don’t realize these tards are bullshitting to your face… / []
I want that job of handing out 2 laptops and cellphones a month. / []
Please do the justice system next!!!!!! / []
Medicare is a racket. Even if you never go see a doctor or use prescription drugs you still have to give Medicare $1500.00 a year. This is what has been happening in our family. / []
🕊🗽🇺🇲🦅 Thank you, Doge...!! / []
Wow! You all are amazing!!  Thank you! / []
TRUMP HAS DECLARED SANCTUARY RIGHTS WITH GLOBAL WARMING TERRORISM / []
My mom collects social security and medicaid.  She is targeted by scammed overseas daily, calling from local numbers.  She pays for a phone, but afraid to answer.  She had her benefits turned off as someone had declared her deceased in another state.  She called and they asked her to submit proof of being alive.  It must have been easier to defraud their office.  I hope DOGE can protect our seniors as they are lifelong taxpayers and deserve dignity.  She donated to a fake NGO for law enforcement despite an annual income below the poverty line.  These scammers typically operate in the same countries. Is there a way to hold these governments accountable? / []
To be honest, I always heard from the media about Elon and I always thought he was one of those guys that we just never hear about because they are the super industry focused people.  After watching this video, he is really focused on saving people they're hard earnd money.  Go DOGE!!! / []
Good transparent stuff. / []
There’s more IQ points in that room than in the entire congress. / []
Yes sir!! Elon is a patriot 💪 / []
Cutting Americans JOBs will help America come out from debt??   Cutting Americans job will affect America’s economy only!  God be with people who’s loosing their job.  May God bless America! / []
Good jobs guys, keep up the good work.  Thank you all / []
I've already started to receive more Social Security money. / []
Praying for Doge.❤ I was attacked by a fraudster this last week end to the tune of 479.98. Chase Bank caught it unbelievable. This aweful! / []
When will we learn who “they” are?  Who are for 150 year olds on social security - the 9 month olds getting small business loans? / []
All this money was wasted and stollen, and I have to pay taxes if not the irs enforcers show up and threaten me. DONT forget obiden wanted a heavily armed agency . / []
Thank you gentlemen, you are true patriots 🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Yes, it took OPM 3 month to analyze & make a decision for my government retirement in 2015!!, / []
Reduce to trillion? He makes 365.6 billion a year if he wanted to he could himself but no human would give all there money away to something fake 😅 / []
Thank God President Trump Won for the 3x !❤ / []
I’m not surprised about the politicians fighting back against DOGE. What I can’t fathom is there are people out there who agree with the politicians who are fighting DOGE / ["I saw a video of a protestor being questioned, he didn't even know what DOGE was doing, he's just protesting cause the media told him to.", 'I assume its because they are beneficiaries in some tertiary way.', 'It’s mind boggling', 'Sheep']
It's crazy how this isn't getting any push or replays by mainstream media. / ['That is typical of the propagandists not to share anything that is actually helping Americans in any way.  They are anti American fear mongers paid for by the deep state.   \nGod bless America 🙏❤️😇', '@fransiscon YT CENSORSHIP IS ALIVE & WELL.  🙏❤️😇', 'It’s not their narrative', "You're kidding, right? That's how they steal money.

Stop these folks from playing in your face. They are simply banking on the fact you do not know how the government works and its administrative functions. They are banking on the fact that you never took a business course. They are banking that you are naïve enough to buy into the belief that they are subject matter experts and know better than the many well educated and experienced people who do the work everyday. They want you to believe that the few cases that they find of waste is indicative of government waste when much of the government runs more efficiently than most businesses of its size. / []

❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Straight talk for the American people. I love it and support it 100%. Thank you all for your hard work to save America. / []
F#@K ISREAL! / []
These guys should be like the founding fathers they should be put on pedestals for what they’re giving up to do for our country because they understand if they don’t do it this country is gonna go bankrupt and nobody’s gonna have money / []
Great interview. I feel Brett Baird is the last of the real TV journalist. I just wished he would've asked more questions of specific things the left attacks DOGE with. I also wish a liber legacy media would do an interview like this with DOGE to be fair. / []
this has to be the most important thing for the long term! heroes no doubt. / []
If you’re a democrat and you don’t watch this, you’re crazy if you don’t think this is the best thing that might’ve happened to this country this team they’re not stealing our money they’re saving it please watch it. Don’t listen to your other news channels / []
i love this administration! Doge is doing a tremendous job at saving America’s money.God bless them all! Thank you🙏 / []
Why isn’t DOGE auditing the pentagon and Defense budget. That is where HUGE waste is. / []
It's amusing watching the Democrats try to hide the stench of their corruption with their violent Tesla protests, hoaxes and conspiracy theories.. Because ain't nobody paying them any attention.. / []
This is long overdue.  Thank you DOGE!!!! / []
CAN YOU PLEASE GET RID OF THE F-35 PROGRAM!!! / []

No one with half a brain can watch this and be against what doge is doing.. I mean the government has been absolutely burning our money and they are trying to put an end to it. / []

But any evidence. Cause when u say idk why people don't like. Me your missing something in your heart or in your mind  so I can't belive anything you say / []
I love these guys!!! Brilliance pure Brilliance!!!❤❤😊 / []
This needs to be on national news and live on podcasts / []
I don't belive there is someone with genuine good intetions in this world who doesn't see this are the good guys. President Trump is not the smartest but is smart enough to hire the smartest people avalable to fix a problem. / []
A group of Elon's / []
Thank you Elon & God Bless you & your DOGE TEAM! / []
Elon is the real deal folks, enjoy it while you can. And hope they dont get him hated then slain. / []
Please don't continue to just spend more since your saving. 6 TRILLION  is still an unbelievable amount of money. And my next question: Are those responsible for all these crazy spending sprees going to be held accountable? I am thankful for the work they are doing. This should have been done YEARS AND YEARS ago. And it should be done EVERY year or even semi annually to prevent this from ever happening. Leaders had to know this is happening. Both Dems. & Republicans did this. / []
Let's go team DOGE.❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉 / []
Thank you to all of these very amazing people here. We are very blessed 🙌🏻 / []
Do we really think this group, has an evil motive? You can feel the love and respect they have for our country. USA  Thank you! / []
Makes sense that faux news audience would eat this up. / []
If only the liberal mind was able to comprehend and think for itself,  they would know this is good. / []
Love my great nation, president, DOGE, and my Republican Party!  Thank you! / []
Amazing keep it up DOGE if only the world was full of people like you! ❤ / []
Can I give 1k thumbs up / []
This is outrageous. I’m looking at the amount of taxes taken from me last year and to think it’s going to thieves is beyond enraging. I hope the thieves are discovered and prosecuted, their ill gotten wealth taken away / []
Enormously powerful and informative 40 minutes of video. True Americans. / []
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!...THANK YOU / []
Overstaffing doesn't mean that the performance records of these employees of the federal government is fraudulent, now these people can't get unemployment because they're claiming that these people are being let go because they're performance isn't up to snuff That is cruel / []
When musk says he doesn’t involve Congress and it shouldn’t be an issue because what he’s doing is in Congress’s best interest, that would be like saying hey I just attacked this guy who was trying to mug someone and I murdered him. But because I did what I think a police officer would’ve done and I think my actions were consistent with a police officers that must mean that that’s OK. The irony is how inefficient hiring musk and doge was because there was already a body called Congress that was responsible for that. / []
Its government incompetence that in my lifetime (I’m 50) that this is the first time this DOGE process has happened. / []
❤ / []
Great job to the DOGE team we appreciate you! ❤ My sister is a teacher and someone filed for her benefits fraudulently    Thankful she had someone in the dept who knew her and stopped it. Also as an ssdi recipient the ssa computers have gone down all the time, long before Trump and DOGE. / []
Thank You Elon . / []

We folks in Alabama love ❤️ you elon musk and doge !thanks for standing up for America 🇺🇸! / []

These people are helping Americans and this country tremendously / []
My respect for Elon grows everyday / []
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Elon's explanation has always been very logic and easy to understand it.  What I don't understand is why many people do not think cutting the size of the government is bad thing.  I used to work in a computer industry, and we always tried to operate efficient, no waste in the process.  Dems always trying to bring down people who are doing great things for the country and why can't they find some productive things to help people??? / []
Brilliant guys! Keep at it. After you are finished can you visit the UK government. / []
What I find Ironic is I have tried several times to get a SBA for a startup loan but I guess im to old or im too young or because I'm not connected to the right political party I  was rejected, and told it's because i have a past, Why don't they give me that same response when collecting taxes. It's a shame what has happened here, 30 trillion and using a " Literally cave man file system  " God bless America / []
What about all these ads with those cards that you can receive them and no pay back??? Can you. Say something about. Please❤ / []

The DOGE Team interview. The most important 30 minutes of your lives. WATCH IT. STOP listening to the endless LIES from the Liberal MSM, Nancy, Chuck, Adam, AOC, Maxine and the mendacious Radical Left Democratic Party. The ones crying the loudest are the guilty ones and their Net Worth proves just that !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
The man didn’t get elected and yall letting him access sensitive information… no wonder he poured all that money into the GOP… they were desperate and president musk is cashing in his investment / []
Absolutely amazing interview / []
Someone please tell me, Why are Democrats so against DOGE???. I try to keep such an open mind. I just can’t wrap my head around  why they have so much hate. The way the media has perverted so many minds is messed up.. / []
Thank you, Elon, for all that you do, at great personal risk ❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []

I work in IT as an engineer. You can’t just make changes wholesale on mission critical systems. That is why it takes so long. If done the right way, it takes a few years to upgrade. The government has been actively upgrading their systems for years. It’s just a massive system. / []
How can any American be against this? / []
Thank you Elon and team ....keep up the good work / []
Doge are true patriots and the fact that people are against them is a shameful indicator that interviews like these are not shown on all networks / []
Legend. / []
Hero!!! / []
Killary’s yelping in the background / []
…and all this before we talk about the ridiculous terms of government employee retirement benefits, ages, COLA pensions and more. Politicians buying votes from gov employees are ruinous for taxpayers whose financially responsible employers would NEVER offer anything similar. DC votes over 90% for Democrats.😡 / []
👀👀👀 / []
Thanks Jesus for DOGE! / []
The only people that are yelling are DIRTY we all know it! / []
I am all for this, but does anyone else think that they all possess a robotic speech cadence?  It must be their mega smarts. / []
WHO are the fraudsters? / []
You guys are much appreciated!! Don’t get discouraged. Keep being awesome!!! / []
Praise Jesus! Thank you to all these men!!!! ❤❤❤❤ / []
If you have a problem with DOGE you are the one ripping off the system... Get mad your days are numbered! / []
So much crying in this lobby! lol what are you crying about let Elon cook! Listen with your ears not your Mouth America / []
This is the best for America. / []
Very Best Important interview for the US citizen and the people in their country. 😮😮😮...  This what happening almost all the gov of the countries !!!!😮😮😮 OMG... / []
So tell me how this is fraudulent! Maybe wasteful, and we need to improve it but just to go in willy-nilly and hurt so many people in the beginning of all this you're wrong you're all wrong for doing it / []
I heard from someone who worked for DOD in DC that their database was paper and not on computer. That was 30 years ago and hearing these facts made me wonder if they were online today. / []
God bless Elon Musk and the team finding fraudulent and wasteful spending within Federal Governments Agencies. 🙏 for hope for future and America and keep America safe from these force's behind shadows who rules and don't seem like idea that DOGE is doing the right thing for America going forward and future.😊I'm glad DOGE team is coming forward and we believe  thier doing good for humanity 👍 👏 and Trump doing for America 🇺🇸 and only corrupt people who don't want that and want to continue abused Federal Reserves and taxpayers.Thank you Elon Musk for fixing it and removing those who no longer alive and everything is postive in what you do for America to cutting spending and fraudulent payments which are important to take care this issues.😊Americans are behind you 100% / []
Praise the true almighty Heavenly Father for Renewing America and making it great better than ever Amen 🙏🏻 / []

Thank you to all. Are the fraudsters going to possibly get punished / []
They need a marketing campaign to get this out. Hate to say it but it would be worth it. If you're mad at the pol trying to prevent your money from being stolen, you're absolutely programmed to hate. / []
I am truly thankful for Elon Musk and his Doge team for the great work they are finding that has been being wasted or truth is that m9ney has been going to the Demon-crat party and we the people want to know their names and the amount of money each person has received to the current date. Those people must pay back each dime and they know they been getting that money and after they pay it back, send them to Prison for stealing from this Country. An i hear dems screaming out lies after lie and I bet those are the ones getting most of the money. Along with the 8 judges who are trying to stop Doge team from finding out that trail to see who is getting the money at the end, bank account number and the name on it. / []
Keep it up cut all the BS out and get money flowing back to the people who work hard the middle class makes the world turn reward them / []
Our country is lucky to have brilliant minds like Elon Musk.  And to be fair, Elon is also lucky to live in a country that affords him the opportunity to utilize and implement his gifts.  It is very honorable for him to step into this role, and giving back to this Country through the DOGE work.  I don't agree with everything he focuses in on, ( i.e. Colonizing Mars seems like a waste of time and money), but I trust him.  And trust is hard to come by in the world of politics.  Illegal immigration and reckless government spending/deficits are massive threats to the security of our country.  I do not understand why anyone would be against what DOGE is doing. / []
THANK God for DODGE / []
That is a gross misrepresentation of NIH indirect costs. / []

1. Oligarchy and the unchecked influence of billionaires: Sanders vehemently criticizes the "oligarchic form of society” in which a handful of billionaires control the government. He faults wealthy individuals like Elon Musk for trying to cut important social programs like Social Security and the Veterans Administration in order to provide tax breaks for the rich. He sees this as "greed of the oligarchy ” as the country's worst evil. The fact that the three richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of the population is cited as evidence of this oligarchy.  2. Attacks on democracy by Donald Trump: Sanders accuses President Donald Trump of undermining the Constitution. He criticizes his attacks on the First Amendment by intimidating the media and persecuting critics. He also criticizes Trump's disregard for the constitutional responsibilities of Congress, such as the unlawful withholding of funds and the dismantling of agencies. Trump's attacks on the independence of the judiciary are also sharply criticized.  3. Massive economic and social inequalities:  Sanders denounces the extreme income and wealth inequality in the US. He emphasizes that the rich have never been so well off, while many working families are struggling to survive. He criticizes the fact that CEOs earn 300 times more than the average worker and that workers' real wages have fallen despite increases in productivity. He addresses the precarious situation of people who live from paycheck to paycheck, cannot afford rising rents and healthcare costs and, in the worst case, become homeless.  4. Defective and unaffordable healthcare system:  Sanders criticizes the “broken, dysfunctional and outrageously expensive” US healthcare system. He criticizes the fact that the USA spends a disproportionate amount on healthcare compared to other developed countries, but has a lower life expectancy. He denounces the high number of uninsured and underinsured people and criticizes the fact that the system is geared towards maximizing the profits of insurance and pharmaceutical companies instead of ensuring healthcare as a human right. The high cost of prescription drugs is also highlighted as a serious problem.  5. Corrupt political system:  Sanders sees a corrupt campaign finance system in which billionaires can buy elections and criticizes the two-party landscape in which both Republicans and Democrats pander to the interests of big corporations and wealthy donors. / []

I love Elon's passion! / []
I hope some of the found/recovered money (thank you!!) will indeed be shared with us too… we are hanging on the threads, please hurry / []
The news media journalists and social media influencers are being used by radical leftists individuals. They have been so brainwashed they cannot see themselves being used by corrupt, evil, greedy, selfish individuals. / []

All of these things would have been in place when Trump had his first term as president right. If it so desperately needed to be fixed and is ruining everything, why didn't he spend his first term doing everything to fix it. Smoke and mirrors whilst he puts his dictatorship in place. Let's fence off America like it is a virus. / []

lol HOLYSHIT the mine is real?!!!! / []
Thank God for Elon Musk and his DOGE Team!!!! If it wasn't for all of you as well as President Trump the Democratic Party would have been ripping off American Taxpayers for decades!! Not only have they put American Citizens 35+ TRILLION DOLLARS in Debt but they were putting BILLIONS of DOLLARS into a private slush fund for their own Woke, Progressive transgender projects in Countries, money laundering and filling their own pockets!!!! Democrats would continue to do this forever due to their refusal to equip the federal government with updated computer systems to be able to track where our federal tax money went and to who!!! Again, Thank God for Elon Musk and his DOGE Team for finding over a Trillion Dollars in Fraudulent Accounts!!! Everyone with legitimate Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid Accounts will now be getting a nice raise in monthly benefits!! Please reach out to Elon Musk and his DOGE Team and tell them Thank you for all of their hard work that they provided for free!! ❤❤❤❤❤🎉 / []

Elon is a hero for doing this 🙏 / []
They have cut te wrong things. None of these guys are experts! Doge need stop. Millions of experts have been eliminated!!! This is only for the few Muti- Billionaires!! We the middle class and the poor are suffering!! Musk boy has no idea in how to put Americas to work.Prices are already gong up!! We the poor are not even in their mind!! Stop Doge. Send musk boy to Mars permanently. Or send hi back to South Africa. Tesla is loosing money every day!! Then stock Markets are crashing! It was way up under Biden! Biden had a 4% unemployment!

At the State of California we were charged with being good stewards of scarce, sacred public resources.

35:59 what happened to free speech??? / []
DOGE❤ I salute you, you are hero’s and you all will be a part of history.  I thank you all so much. The DOJ and opposing democrats really need to back off and see the common sense of this all.❤❤❤😊The Tesla violence needs to stop, the rhetoric should be illegal as their inciting violence. Everyone should be buying Tesla cars or stock to support Elon.😊 Mark Kelly has sold his soul.  I hate that he is in office in my state he needs to be voted OUT! / []
Wanna know why other networks don’t show this? Because they are government funded, paid to lie. They HATE this country! Thank God for Fox News and Sky News Australia for saying REAL news / []
What he is doing as a hack is far better done by the Inspectors generals of the departments. Chopping away at the government without understanding the functions of the departments and programs is unacceptable. “Bankruptcy” versus a functioning democracy. This is Democracy turned on its head. / []
“It's a left propaganda. We go after them.“ Is this guy from a different galaxy or what? This guy needs to practice self reflection first.😂 / ['How is elon causing any violence?

America is privileged to have Elon Musk discovering huge abuse . The gratitude should be from all Americans . This is not political it’s for everyone’s benefit . ❤ / []
Look at the Eagles on the background / []
They don't look like kids to me. / []
Thanks you Elon and the team please keep doing what you’re doing to help America and Americans ❤🙏🙏🙏 / []
I absolutely love this. ALL OF THIS! Keep going. / []
Thank you for taking the time to explain everything to me. A lot of what you’re all saying actually reminds me of what’s happening at my job at the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority — there’s a lot of corruption there as well. / []
Elon, you’re an idiot.. you are not a public official.  I don’t not care what you say because you’re nobody in our country / ['If hes a nobody who are you? weirdo 😂😂']

AWESOME! / []
Democrats are lying like crazy and use the medicare and social security or what ever things to manipulate people to hate. What they want is to get back the access to the taxpayer money pot so they can get to fill their own pockets again. Past 4 plus years of supporting criminals is also cause they are criminals on their own by doing corruption with taxpayer money. / []
S3XY / []
That doesn’t look like “a bunch of teenagers” to me 😂 if people watched this with an actual open mind, there’s no way they could walk away with this misconceptions we see in the media. But I’m afraid people don’t know how to be open minded or think about things logically anymore. / []
Elon should really go after those idiots fighting his companies / []
brett looking good / []
Why are we not seeing the perpetrators of the corruption facing prosecution? / []
How can  any Americans disagree with this ? / []
Who is making sure that Elon is just not lying 🤥 he just called Senator Mark Kelly a traitor.? / []
Who would have thought, a legitimate African, the richest in the world, teaching Americans to cut spending, corruption and save. I want to see when DOGE hit the defense department.. 😂😂😂 / []
G-d speed Elon and the just warriors of DOGE / []
I wonder why big balls didn’t show. Seems like a small person to me. / []
Outstanding! / []
It’s hard for me to believe these guys are taking time out of their billionaire schedules to volunteer to monitor OUR money!!! What’s in it for them!??? / ["Ding ding ding. Elon didn't buy Trump the presidency with $300 million of his own money to help the average American"]
Please stop broadcasting all of Doge's cuts! The conservatives all know what a great job you're doing and we don't need to even know what the cuts are at this point. The Dramacrats won't know what to do with themselves and the whole Tesla and Elon hate rage will stop. / []
👏👏👏 / []
We should be throwing parades for these men. They've got better things to do than fix our govt problems. That should be the job of congressmen. But they're doing it because they love America & want it to be better. What kind of haters would not appreciate this?? Oh yeah, Libs & Dems. Thank you, gentlemen, for your great service to our nation. There are far more people with you than against you. God bless you all. / []
Excellent! / []
THANK YOU, DOGE Team! Every patriot in this nation, is grateful for the work you're doing and the difficult tasks at hand. / []
Wow! / []
God bless, and God’s protection over you guys.  Thank you / []
Keep it up Elon! / []
I sincerely think that the republican majority is only going to grow by midterms. We have to VOTE like our lives depend on it! / []
I’m a grown man and literally just fought back tears. Great job Mr. Musk. I’m so happy your in this fight. I’m of no significance but you have my full support. God please protect these men. All of them. / []
Wonderful program it removed myth from reality the Democrats are really corrupt individuals and unpatriotic individuals / []

Fraudsters are the one that make a lot of noise like the corrupt Maxine Waters and AIC. Get them to jail immediately.  Please get all the fraudsters “all of them” in jail.  I am proud of USA because of all these people under the leadership of President Donald Trump. / []

I can’t stand to even look at musk boy. / []
I do think having physical backups for certain key information is important / []
Fook Elon Musk & Donald Trump, both draft dodgers & both bad business men...FACTS! / []
This person is horrifying.  These people are global criminals.  No different than prison escapees overthrowing a prison.  People are losing their life savings right now.  Jobs are dissapearing.  Everything is rising in cost.  The economy is in a nose dive.  National security has been compromised.  Veterans abandoned.  Active military are furious.  It just hasn't affected you yet.  The world is not jealous.  They are horrified and concerned. / []

The government CANT PASS AN AUDIT!!!! BUT if  YOU ARE BEHIND YOUR TAXES AND YOU GET DUMPED IN JAIL!!!! 20:15 / []
How is our entire country not flipping over tables. All of our tax dollars were literally used for a group of democrats to play with.   I think the dems should be jailed for this! If a regular person was to do any of this stuff, they would end in jail. Double standard! Investigate and bury the individuals involved, whether they’re 100 or 40yrs old. / []
Fraudsters are the one that make a lot of noise like the corrupt Maxine Waters and AIC. Get them to jail immediately.  Please get all the fraudsters “all of them “ in jail. / []

Thank you, Elon.  Truly, I believe you are helping this country become better. / []
Heros / []
To think there are so called Americans that are vilifying these fantastic people is sickening.  I have never felt anger towards the left, only pity.  Now I just feel discussed. / []
There is an act making it illegal to "propaganzdize" We the People that Obama got rid of as soon as began his presidency. We have all heard the clip of him of him saying "sometimes they (we) don't know what they want or even need to hear so we need to get everyone on the same page and tell them (I.E. Oppress information, Outright lie to us through scripts in collusion w the Dems and the deep state). I can't remember the name but its someone versus Monk Act that protected our freedom of the press is no longer in play. If that Act is not reinstated, our legacy media will continue to indoctrinate the left so the Dems will have total control, power, and money. / []
This team looks like The Avengers / []

How can people not be happy about this?!?? / []
IM WITH TRUMP/ELON 110 % / []
One day these stupid lefties will appreciate what these smart people Have done but all they know what to do is actually spend that money that republicans are trying to save / []
You cut trillions okay good. But if you cut trillions those trillions will not make their way into our economic system? Where that money is spend. And where is that money spend? HERE MY POINT EXACTLY.  DOESNT TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT?   Does it? / ['I say what ever money is deducted by the DOJE should be returned to the tax payers and not kept by the government.']

Musk This is the problem we have with this …. Stop claiming the people that are mad are only far left…. There’s many republicans that are pissed at your approach … many that were threatened and are being fired based on you. Source been taunting federal workers on your platform. Making them out to be the problem …. Now you’re on here pretending and speaking as if this isn’t true. You’re not genuine and because of this people are pissed. Right and left wing alike. I know you don’t want to beleive this is true but it is. / []
Go after Jimmy Kimmel / []
Only white male billionaires there 😅😅 / []
Elon add to your key phrases that remaining insolvent causes borrowing costs to go up and that means more goes to interest and less to services / []
23:13 typical propaganda line he has used before. “The ones that complain the loudest are fraudsters” — WRONG. / []
It's amazing all the wast and departments in goverment getting alot of our money to do nothing. / []
And one thing the left didn't do,show the people. They did everything behind the curtain. / []
I'd like to know who's been stealing this money and are they going to be prosecuted? / []
I don’t get it!! We the people have been complaining about government spending for over 50 years!!  We are fed up with paying 900.00 for a hammer, 5,000 for toilet seats etc….  At least that’s how they stole from us tab payers!!!  And now you are telling us people are protesting DOGE doing exactly  what we asked them to do?? Who’s really paying for these protestors?? Because we all know it’s Not we the people!!  Those paying these protestors are the real thieves!!  Follows the money!   We are backing you Trump and Musk!! Drain that stinky swamp!!! / []
🔥💪🏾🙏🏿 / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team!! We owe you so much gratitude!!! Every American should see this!! / []
Thank God for His appointments of these men and women that are taking the reins of this Nation. I pray God extends His light into those filled with blind hatred. Let them see Your Love and come to Your Son, in Whom’s name I pray, Even The Christ, Amen. / []
Always believe your government. Never question it. / []
The fact that this plan and undertaking by the administration is so objectionable by the left, should tell us all just how Ani-American and toxic to our democracy the left is. If Trump hadn’t won this election this country would have had no chance for recovery. I don’t think we realize just how damaged and nearly past the point recovery we were as a dying nation. / []
Where is Big Ballz? / []
Wow!!! / []
There's a good reason these men are successful!  God bless them all! / []
Anyone speaking against Elon is a moron / []
Why anyone would want to attack Elon and his Tesla dealerships is beyond  incomprehensible.   Goes to show you how the Media is so against Trump they only know how to spread hate.  They sould all show this interview and thank Elon and DOGE. If they cut every tax payer a 5,000$ check i wonder if the leftists will throw it away or be first in line to cash it? / []
Notice. No talk about abortions. what happened? / []
Every American should watch this. It's a herculean effort from the Doge team, and they get our whole hearted support.   It's like Elon said, a painful homework. Fixing those old systems is crazy work.   I wish they extended it more, if needed. But I understand the urgency. They must think they only have 1 1/2 years, to show resilts before the midterms campaing starts. If Republicons lose the Congress majority, Doge is over, I fear. / []
3:28 jaw slicing, coke? / []
That was very informative. Thank you / []
I believe another thing to do us reduce the number of public service employees in the government / []
Thank you guys so much,our children will be much better off. America will be so much STRONGER. / []
It's amazing what can be done when you pull together high I.Q., very successful people working on a common goal. The exact opposite of DEI. / []
He’s Right “ for what ?” 🛑 Well said here here 🤝  America 🇺🇸 First ✊ period ! / []
How can you not like what these guys are doing. / []
Amazing that people can’t detect lies that are so easily disproven. Keep in mind, congress funds and designates buckets of money. After that, DOGE cuts. The, “Savings” will go to tax cuts for corporations and the rich. That is theft. Meanwhile, the Republican House will wake up long enough to get a budget that increases deficits by 2.8 TRILLION over 10 years. By then, Trump and doge will have moved on to other things and the damage will be done. Follow the money and think critically. / []
If you are fighting this,you are on the TAKE,no questions about it / []
Thank GOD FOR ELON MUSK..... AND THE EXCELLENT PICK OF INDIVIDUALS HE HAS TO CLEAN THIS UP MESS WE HAVE IN OWER GOVERNMENT. / []
Softball after softball. / ['lol loser alert right here']
I absolutely love this! Keep going. / []
This definitely won't shown nor discussed on npr 😅 / []
The truths coming out.   So thankful to all whom expose this.   Amen / []
Thank you for this program. I’m 85 and have learned so much. Yes Mr. Musk, there is great evil working against all of you wonderful folks trying to help save America. Bless all of you. / []
Where's Amy Gleason the head of Dodge? / []
"Negotiated settlement" in Ukraine sounds very noble... until Russia gets hungry again, and the noble negotiators keep negotiating  Russia's borders every time they get hungry all the way to the Atlantic ocean. Appeasement only invites more invasion has Mr Musk not studied any history? I know he has studied many things but the appetite of hungry Communist dictators is not one of them. / []
Hell yes. So much admiration for the DOGE team’s contribution to the country! / []
Racist African Boer. Go back to Africa / []

Great to Watch for all U.S.A.🇺🇲 Citizens. 💯 Thank you 👏DOGE Team for caring🙏 and that America is worth taking this action that will matter!🇺🇲🗽❤️🤍💙MAGA!🇺🇲👍💯🇺🇲🗽 / []
I really don't get why it's so hard for people to understand what doge is trying to accomplish. If they don't agree with it then they either have too much pride and ego to admit trump and elons/team is doing something right. Or they just don't have the logic and rational to understand simple things. Thank you to the Trump admin AND doge team for caring about American Citizens. / []
THANK YOU, ELON MUSK! / []
The passion in Elon’s face in the ending segment where he’s one on one is very telling. The personal attacks on him and the employees of his companies are taking a toll on him. I pray that he has the strength and protection to continue his work to help save America. / []
Honestly these guys doing this voluntarily is insane. So glad my future is being protected by them. / []
God Bless this group of patriots! / ['Amen']
God is in control for the country that love him , wonderful!! / []
The fact that we don’t know where our taxes are going yet still paying it shows how we lost the plot a while  ago / []
Things will get bad for everybody in these next few years under this administration and when it happens don’t blame democrats or independents.Blame yourselves GOP / []
This is a joke. Why with a rocket scientist be useful for economic problems.  Seriously, lives in La La Land. He is insane. / []
The amount of waist and misappropriation is mind-boggling that it has gone on this long / []

Thank you for what you do. / []
Thank you  Doge Team, Most Americans appreciate you, Elon ❤ Trump ❤ / []
They should go on the other networks and do this. / []
Elon is a narcissistic dogebag. All his “emotion” is an act and rehearsed, as revealed in Isaacson’s ‘biography’ about Musk. None of this is about cutting spending. It is about cutting services and funding to programs the far right disagree with. / []
Lol some of the richest people in America trying to “fix” the government. / []
I think a lot of Anti-DOGE people are secretly over 150 years of age. / []

THANK YOU ELON AND TEAM DOGE🎉🎉❤❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍👍 / []
Thank you for all DOGE team and Elon. / []
The plutocrats and aristocrats are intelligent and more capable to serve the nation and to make their lives better and safeguard the interests of the country internally and abroad better than the kleptocrats .. / []
K, let me kno when yall get this sorted out n I'll start paying taxes again. / []
yes Elon, it's far left propaganda that's what made your kid trabs.  Not you never being there to raise them or the fact you give them sci Fi trans names to begin with.  You made Twitter trans.  We all throw our hearts out to you. / []
Real Americans support DOGE. / []
Elon almost had me convinced until he said trump is an honest man. 🤣 / []
Thank You DOGE for saving our Country future / []
this what.!!!  this is the new and young ppl we been asking for since Alice Cooper sang schools out forever. / []
I know plenty of people who wouldn’t watch this bc it goes against their preconceptions. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink *sigh* / []
So who were complaining that the DOGE TEAM were KIDS!!!!........These Guys are CREAM of the CROP guys, functioning at the highest level and also all accomplished. / []
Incredible work ❤ / []
The fraudsters will be found. thats the problem for them, they cant hide due to the system, they will need to get in that big "vault" and burn all papers. That wont happen, when "they" try they will be stopped by forces. / []
The pentagon losing money…not knowing where it went?…it went to black projects. / []
LOVE EVERY BIT OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Great job DOGE!!!!! / []
👍100% support DOGE / []
Never in my lifetime would I have expected this scale of corruption to be exposed. Never / []
Thank you for auditing the American peoples bank account! Musk keep digging! Trump time to find these people and charge them! 🇺🇸⚖️👩‍⚖️ / []
I think that every streaming channel television channel and radio station should be forced to watch this DOGE is cutting through the Red tape and letting the public know about how there tax money is spent 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
With interest rates, Usa will never pay back its dept. / []
Seems like past political leaders were just treating us like a giant slush fund . / []
Just give me ..ALL MY..MY..MY ...MONEY !! / []
Thank you, DOGE. 🙏🇺🇸 / []
Elon is Amazing 🇺🇸♥️ / []
These morons on the left foaming at the mouth over this need to be forced to watch this clockwork orange style until they get it. / []
Lazy federal govt… buck up… federal employees have no idea how hard it is to make $100000 in a private sector with no holidays and working for more than 40 hours every week and working over weekends, no PTO, no proper health insurer etc..: my blood is boiling how inefficient federal workers have been… get them out!!!! / []

DEPORT ELON / []
EVERY American should see this. Many won't consider it because they don't care about America or their children's American inheritance. The democrats push to hate Elon rather than fix America. Shame on them.  Democratic leaders only want money and power, not America patriots. / []

Nice work …. Now it’s time to go after the biggest offenders…. Defense and Healthcare / []
Based on some of the comments, u can understand why our country is in the shape its in. Brainwashed ignorant people, are voting mindlessly for these people that would just as soon see them dead as give them a dollar. But yet they continue on in the same way / []
Will this team be able to catch the people that have been collecting this money from small businesses loans / []
WE MUST CUT SPENDING OR WE GO INSOLVENT THEN NO ONE GETS ANYTHING! I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS!!!! / []
Am I the only one who feels like this was a nothing burger?  It’s all talk with no actual proof or evidence of what they’re doing. They just said what they’re trying to do, which they have previously done / []
Do people see now why Trump fired all those IGs?   Either they were incompetent or they were in on it. Either way they got to go!. / []
Also look into the department of building / []
Americans are so stupid being entertained by this script. You all are sheep and deserve what's coming to you / []
Virtue signalling, how clearly he sees this world... Elon M , 'Elohim' spiritual being from the heavenly realm, a powerful guardian angel. It's right there in plain site. He is an outstanding entity with proven achievements and genius. He does not need to do this - put himself in the firing line. Our Lord Jesus Christ stated take up your cross and follow me. Like himself he knew what would happen if you dare to question the narrative or authority. Take up your cross , he knew they would crucify you. That is what they are trying to do to Trump and Musk - but I believe with all my heart they were sent by the creator to protect us from the corruption and evil. Elon does not have to answer to these people , on his day of judgement he can be contented in the fact that he tried to act with compassion,  integrity and bravery... as for the rest of them? When their time comes they will have alot to answer for.  Thank you Elon from the bottom of my heart , you will go down in history as one of the greatest human beings of all time 🙏 / []
🇬🇧  uk loves musk / []
Thank you DOGE!!! / []
I agree, Elon...people died and for what? Nothing! You are correct! End this war! / []
How could anyone not support this, unless you are a criminal getting your cut?   Right Joe? / []
you're going after yourself on X? bold move, Elon. you have my support - stop the propaganda! / []
God bless you all!!!!!! / []
Glad I watched this video. Computer systems that communicate with each other across government agencies are critically important. I recently went through a government filing that took nearly a year, despite a 30-day estimate. Every agency I spoke with had inconsistent information about the process and my forms. The experience showed me just how much improvement is still needed. Any effort to make government work faster and smarter is worth exploring, regardless of which party is in the White House. / []
If only this was legal. / []
Thank you for the transparency / []
If you're a politician or ngo and are against doge and what they are doing..My question is, what do have in your closet? let me see your phone/hardrive :) / []
Great interview. Thx. And thank you to Elon Musk and all of the gentleman working for to save our country. / []
A computer system from 1950’s would be extremely difficult to hack from outsiders. There is a benefit reason for leaving the old computer system in place. If they upgrade the system, it will put things more at risk. / []
Wonderful interviews!! These are good men. / []
Thank you! / []
3:45 the rocket scientist's eyes be lookin like he's being fed an LLM output via neuralink as he's talking / []

That’s Trump approval rating is at all time high / []

Just wanted to say thank you guys .u are saving america.and all of u more American than most. 👍 great job keep it up MAGA 4 ever / []
All white panel doesn’t represent the true demography of this country. I can’t believe Doge couldn’t find one non-white to be in the panel by merit.  Aram doesn’t count because he is working for Elon at Neuralink. / []

The GREAT EIGHT! These men are HEROES! Elon is the Messiah of Federal Government. How can anyone not have only the utmost respect for these people? They are doing this for our future and our children’s future. Only evil fraudsters or very stupid useful idiots who are totally brain dead or brainwashed could be upset with DOGE. / []
Great team!.  Thank you. / []
Wasn’t the democrats screaming that DOGE was nothing but a bunch of 19 yr olds? 😂 So happy to see what DOGE is doing!! / []
This  man is mad elon / []
"It takes only One to begin a Revolution." / []
God bless these men and please protect them and their families! / []
Thank you all for your dedication to our God given country. Our prayers are with you all / []
Thank you DOGE.  America 🇺🇸 is forever grateful ❤ / []
This team is so impressive and the changes they are planning to make are so exciting. Imagine it: an efficient government that can pass an audit?! Amazing. / []
This makes me so angry that we've been ripped off by our own govt forever / []
We were an occupied nation and didn’t know it. And the InfilTraitors almost got away with it. / []
If you’re against this, then you’re against America. That’s all there is to it. There is no other viewpoint, you cannot rationalize being against us. / []
Well done guys all of these guys are so clued up on what is important keep going and when your finished with the USA come to the UK and sort our system out / []
Another example of how backwards the system works. When I was in the service our division Chief call use all together at the end of the quarter. He would tell us how much of the quarters budget wasn't spent. He would then send us on a mission to server mart to spend what wasn't spent. Meaning we spent money we didn't need to, because if you didn't spend 100% of your quarters budget we would lose what wasn't spent. There was zero incentive to run your department efficiently. / []
Keep it going guys!  It's needed.  It's logical.  It must be done! / []
its other companys elon hahahahaaha / []
24:30 wow I got goosebumps hearing him saying that epic message. Puts a tear of joy in my eyes / []
Thank you so much us poor people need you to get this done! / []
Proud  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Left love it / []
Thank you, DOGE / []
Extremely good and convincing performance of the DOGE team 👏 / []
Right on DOGE! / []
Talks like this should take a lot of the anxiety out of what's happening with DOGE. I appreciate your time and sacrifice to fix these governmental IT problems. / []
It’s such a shame that this interview couldn’t be broadcast across all news platforms.  Americans from both sides of the aisle. Need to see this. / []
GO GETEM✅️ / []
More likes come on / []
Nere come Neuralink! / []
And when he’s gone what right back to it / []
mindblowing not only for Americans, but also in Europe we should take lessons of this revolution that takes place in USA. / []
OK I'm not from the USA, please tell me why you would be against what these people are doing .  Genuinely I would love to know. / []
Please Elon help the Pentagon with the Accounting they will be very greatful  thank you / []
Kippers and curtains fur coat and no knickers / []
What a team! They’re doing great things. The Democrats are so misinformed. They truly want America to fail. / []
We are so lucky to have these group of smart people helping our country . / []
I don't believe that   SMH they Make people come to the office.. and submit proof.. / []
What I want to know…are the “fraudsters” going to be prosecuted? / []
12:55 nothing was done? I’m sure Obama admin reallocated those funds to his people / []
We aren’t “afraid” of this. Only the fraudsters are. / []
Amazing, you guys are great / []
New founding fathers with all the savings they've found / []
Wow how the democrats and media have been lying . Thank you guys you’re doing a great job. They are scaring the hell out of seniors and there mush be a lot more calls. / []
God bless the DOGE Team! Jesus please protect them ❤ / []
great interview! / []
Yes again Elon is a big example,a man that inspires / []
Thank you for this Bret.  I hope you do many more of these interviews.  It was fantastic to see these honorable and brilliant citizens contributing to the goal of making America financially solvent. We really do owe them a HUGE debt of gratitude. THANK YOU DOGE!!! 🎉🥳🙏✝️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Man growing up watching Elon never would I think he could be in the White House saving this great nation ! He’s going into the history books. I can see future generations learning about all his accomplishments and achievements . We are witnessing something great right now. / []
Thank you 🎉 / []
amazingly paced interview, these guys are the avengers / []
Sure cut the bad contracts from outside contractors that steal from the government. But firing fed workers that work as hard as anyone else, especially in public facing roles, is just unfair / []
someone answer why paper is bad for this but good for votes / []
If we ran our businesses like the government runs theirs, we’d be declaring bankruptcy after day 1. / []
They are doing a great job, its about time the Government is being audited. / []
God bless these gentlemen. They’re not on a physical battlefield, but they are fighting a war. They are Patriots. / []
You'd have to be crooked, unintelligent or brainwashed by the left not to understand the good the DOGE team is doing for our country. Thank you Musk for taking the hits for leading this team. 🇺🇸💪 / []
We Love You Guys!! Keep up the Great Work!! / []
Thankyou hero’s ! / []
Thank GOD we finally have a President with the balls to fix this waste! And thank GOD for Elon offering to do it! / []
TRUE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOVE YOU ALL FOR SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY WORK YOUR TEAM IS DOING!!! My blood boils hearing how we all have been scammed at such an enormous manner while our government knowingly has been ignoring it! It means one thing only, many people in government have been involved in these frauds one way or another, mostly democrats since they’re complaining about it!!! / []
Thank you Elon and Doge Team 🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
We do not care about DOGE critics.  We trust God Elon does great job. / []
The most sensible, believable future plan for America undertaken by 8 professionals who can make it achievable / []

Government departments are legislated into existence by authorizing legislation, and funded by appropriations legislation.  Those are laws.  Out of respect for the legislative branch, once those laws are signed, the executive branch is obligated to obey.  By violating both types of legislation, The Trump Administration is breaking the law.  If the Republicans want to make major changes at HHS, Department of Education or USAID, they cannot violate the legislation that founded or funded these agencies without, literally, breaking the law. / []
Thank you D.O.G.E. Team for caring more about making things right and better for us Americans finally. KEEP FIGHTING FOR US. / []
Why aren’t they talking about the government contracts Elon musk is receiving? / []
Heroes 😎😎😎😎 / []
We as an American work so hard just to keep up the bills to just pay the place to live and for foods to feeds our children and pay for all the bills. But Yet our government gave a way all the money from our American hard working to go waste. We pray for America to be prosperous and blessed. We pray for wisdom for the governments and President and his workers to improve America again. Amen. / []
It means going away in space and beyond. / []
About time we bring in our best to fix the government / []
This interview should be mandatory viewing for every member of Congress.  Especially for people like Warren and Schumer who have done nothing but spread lies about DOGE and what DOGE is doing.  The reason why is obvious: DOGE is stopping the flow of gravy from the government to their gravy trains. / []
ABSOLUTE WOW!  ❤ / []
I hope they all have access or security overseen/ covered by secret service also / []
It is curious that these are RICH business men putting their efforts into this! How many RICH DEMS are helping do this? ....."crickets".....🤨 When does DOGE see if there is still GOLD in Fort Knox!? / []
Wow this is great. Transparency on how our taxes are being used for the best.  And almost realtime where anyone in Congress can review and can give DOGE any specific feedback at the line level.  Awesome 😎 / []
Every country’s citizens want their own Doge. / []
Keep up the good work! Systems redesign is part of any good business, and the government should always be under process of improvement and fiscal responsibility! / []
Thank you DOGE team for your service! / []
Go Doge Team, man I fly into verdansk with these guys, as a German YOU Americans should be Proud of them... it's a shame how u treat them. The Tesla topic is also a big shame for county. I would be so so grateful to have these guys in my destroyed county .... / []
GO DOGE!!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸⚖️⚖️⚖️ / []
So is Vivek just not apart of this anymore ? / []
One thought that I ‘ve never had before, was that I could fall inlove with a billionaire. Well, it just happened. Elon & DOGE, are the most inspiring tangible thing, that has happened, in my lifetime. And he’s right, it couldn’t have happened without Trump, at the helm.  Thankyou for the interview, and to everyone involved in saving the country. Amen. / []
Proud to be an american again! / []
It sounds corny but if they’re telling the truth, They really are the Tech Avengers / []
Thamkyou so much. God bless / []
if you don't call this absolute transparency you're an idiot. / []
This panel is the opposite of DEI by the way. Bunch of these guys sound nervous and scared of Elon. He is really proving my prophecy. Dr Evil and Thanos / []
As a Democrat it bothers me that Elon wants to stop paying social security payments to 15 million 120 year olds! Their so old! They need this money very badly, they can't work! Without their social security check how are they going to live! 🤡 / []
This is the best thing that could have happened to support the tax payer. Thanks Doge / []
Elon seems to have lost some weight. All well thinking American citizens should be grateful for this Maga movement and DOGE.  Dems represent this nation  are sick people polluting the citizens minds. / []
God bless Team Elon! You all are brilliant & blessed already and we'll continue to pray protection over you all❤ / []
🎉🎉 / []
So this team is auditing the government waste to figure out why the hell we are in such bad debt / []
The propaganda mechanisms on the left are HIGHLY effective. My grandparents are so deeply brainwashed that I can show them verifiable proof; government documents, public records, previous news articles to the contrary, and they still will just outright deny it because the news is saying something "new" today. It's despicable what MSM has done to people. / []
Elon truly has so much compassion for the parents that lost children to this war. / []
I'm a disabled vet that uses the VA. They give us a nice ID card, but yet they still use your SSN for ID. Meaning that when they take your blood for testing they ask you for you FULL SSN. not the last 4 but the whole number. So when I hear these dems scream about DOGE seeing your SSN at the VA anyone that can pull up your account can see your SSN. For the longest time your SSN was even on you medication bottles. Your full SSN out for anyone to see, with your address and all. Just an example of how backwards the system is. / []
Doge is such a tuff name 😭❤️ / []
This is short term pain for long term stability and a happier, healthier, wealthier America! 🇺🇸 / []
I worked for the State of California for 30 years most of which was spent in budget development and management. We performed DOGE-type activities on a regular basis. What the DOGE team is doing is using existing business tools used by governments on a regular basis. Some politicians wanted to centralize, so we centralized. The next politician wanted delegation to the lowest level and we decentralized. Quality circles, quality teams to improve process efficiency and effectiveness. With all of the automation and AI it should be relatively easy to downsize. One of the biggest problems that government has is that its processes are so cumbersome that the systems are obsolete before they even get a purchase order out the door. / []
Elon is an American Hero, and nobody will ever change my mind. Only by buying Twitter, people has no clue how consequential that was for our freedoms. / []
Im from Europe. This government is insane good. Radical right, we won 🎉 / []
I worked for the government everything they say is true. I would like to thank all these men for everything they are doing. Thank you so much. Especially for our children / []
👍👍👍👍👍💪💪🇱🇷🇱🇷 / []
"40% of calls to the SSA are fraudsters... "   And another 40% are seniors melting down looking for their check.   Insane!!!! / []
These guys may literally be saving our country. Give them the respect they deserve! / []
Musk is a unbelievable liar that is cutting from the working class. They've recently been dismantling Social Security and every interview with Musk since, it's clear he didn't understand how Social Security even works. Those 130 year olds that he and Trump have been talking about. Now I've heard 150 & 300 yr olds by republicans.  The program keeps track of the dead recipients names in the data base, but they have NOT been receiving payments. I think Musk knows this but it been easy to trick some of their die hard believers.  If Doge believes they are honest about their cuts then they should release an official report with everything included. Musk already said they're not going to have an official report. So everyone believing him is completely taking his word for it when facts have come out that the amount of their cuts have been wrong and were much lower than they were reporting. / []
“basically almost no one’s gotten fired” what world is elon living in / []
Does anyone remember Ross Peroit??  Yes way back then I believed government should be ran like a business 😮  😀 and hopefully 20 yrs down the road my nieces and nephews children will say thank you so much Auntie Shells / []
Please come and help the uk for gods sake. / []
Amazing interview! Thank you for this. I want to forward it to everyone I know. One of the main things that hit me is how the main street media has really done them dirty. And it's greatly minimized just how much their propaganda has needlessly endangered the lives of these actual heroes. / []
🇺🇸💯💪👍❤️ / []
The entire space program. Glad I could help. / []
Imagine being mad about this.. / []
That was an amazing interview. Thank you Team Doge for sacrificing your time and energy for the future of America 🇺🇸 God Bless you all for your sacrifice. Prayers for much success!!! Go Team America 🇺🇸 / []
Liberals won't even watch this. / []
NO MORE DUAL CITIZENSHIP WITH ISRAEL. NO MORE. You CAN NOT serve two masters. Where do your LOYALTIES lay? With the Republic of the United States or with some other country? I'll say it again. YOU CAN NOT SERVE TWO MASTERS. / []

Thank you, DOGE! / []
Best hair in the room - go B man / []
If he had measured twice and cut once he’d still have balls / []
God bless Elon. Set your jealousy and envy aside and recognize that this man is LITERALLY risking his life every single day to try and save OUR country. It's his country also, and he's trying to save it for himself, his kids, and all the rest of us. What are you doing for our country?  Don't answer that.  Just consider it. / []
Finally, they are talking about the realty, instead of government bureaucracy! / []
Time to modernize the government! / []
God bless you all! / []
Being that nearly 30% of the money I earn gets taken from me biweekly.....this is infuriating....especially in the last 4 or 5 years.......paycheck to paycheck is getting old.... / []
I would like to just say "Thank you" to all of you gentlemen for what you are doing to help all of our families futures and expecially of the generations of military that have given their lives to keep Ameica free.

These guys will force the downfall of america & the human life in the work force we must stand against Elon his access the government is a huge mistake / ['No, we must stand against fraudulent and wasteful spending and reduce our national deficit before America goes bankrupt!']
Every single one of these guys are paying less in taxes than probably all the people commenting. They want to save the government money through DOGE so they dont have to pay their fair share. / ['Wow you have an odd mindset, they are saving hard working Americans from theft and that’s your take … what they are doing has so much value']
God Bless Elon Musk and DOGE. I'm a USMC vet, investigate "ME". For over 30 years I requested help from the VA. Zero help, WHY? Poisoned while on active duty. 100% disabled, desperately need physical therapy and special needs. Check my service record, medical records. Please help us vets who have been abandoned by the previous regimes. / []
🎉❤ / []
This approach is effective and with immediate benefit.  Continue to pay all the bills and cancel all subscription services and all useless spending. / []
So proud of this team thank you to them all and ty to president Trump / []
Just unbelievable! The fact that anyone would give Elon or any of these people crap for what they are doing is just ignorant and ill informed. Keep up the great job DOGE and Elon, there are those of us who appreciate you and support you 100%!!! / []
Thank you Mr Musk! May blessing be upon you! The forgotten American Citizen could not have challenged the corruption that has infiltrated our country. I have been nothing but a servant to the mighty taxer who gives my hard earned money away to fraudulent receptors! / []
Love Elon.  He is so brave! / []
Thank you to these bright minds for everything they do to save our hard earned money. / []

MSM and demoncraps do NOT want anyone seeing this as it not only destroys their narrative but proves them as blantent liars and covering up their corruptions.   It's up to the independents to push this out to as many people as possible and hopefully wake people up to what has been happening from our politicians. / []

Thank you all. Finally people who care about the American people again. / []
I want say thank you to all Elon and everyone of Americans that helping with DOGE / []
People that think this money goes to the people its not. And why should it? This is as said done for the country to not go bankrupt. This is done to take down the debt America has. The billionaires here are getting well payed for their work most likely but the question is. Do you want to take down the debt or not? If not okey then you don't want this and are against DOGE. / ['You can get the tax down by making billionaires pay there fair share. De debt is going up harder then ever under trump. They ate lying']

Yeah! What most people who believe in you trump and his team! The people who actually listen to this team being interviewed! Let’s cut the waste and let’s get the people on these benefits More money! More help! lol lol. But why the heck people are mad at this? Blows my mind! I have never liked Tesla! Just not my style. Plus I’m very tall so. Nothing against Elon. Think he is great! But I am pushing towards trading in these piles of hunks 💩 recalled prone over priced epa restricted fords in for a fleet of Tesla. I mean the cyber truck the little model s the x. lol dnt think ill get a very good trade in is the only thing spooking me! Cause ford is a joke and no one wants them! Then going to wrap all Tesla in American flags! Yeah! Freak these people out up here in Portland lol! 😆 can’t wait to get out of here away from wacky town! / []
Could the opponents and the ravenous naysayers take 40 minutes and watch this and sincerely listen? What has happened to common sense? Has it left the room completely?   I am approaching 64 years old this year, to my recollection nothing like this was ever done. In my lifetime, it sounds like it was never done…. no restraints no audits no self control. A private business run like this would be bankrupt and out of business….RAPIDLY. How does the federal government develop an attitude that they are beyond reproach and cannot be questioned? This is outrageous on so many levels! / []
We Must, Trust, in Musk! / []
I am excited about America's future, and I thank Elon Musk and his team. Keep going, we need you! / []
Hey FOX YOU - you’re apathy is disgraceful.  You’re only different from CNN in name, but we all see you…you should be investigated. / []

Keep up the great politically unbiased videos! It’s a breath of fresh air in a highly charged environment! As a former AF officer I maintained an apolitical attitude…even the things I had opinions on I withheld those because you don’t want to isolate anyone under your command. Post retirement I’ve generally maintained my apolitical approach online only sharing my political opinions to close friends and in person and even then I never try to demonize someone who disagrees with me. You seem to have that same sentiment and I appreciate it very much! / []
I totally support you and your team. Mistakes are going to be made but like you said you correct them quickly. I am praying God continues to give each of you his wisdom and protection / []
Keep it up, all American shall support his team / []

As a non-american who watches this, this is so informational coming from intelligent individuals trying to help their nation. This should be shared to everyone, to have their eyes open. / []

I'm Canadian and this information made me teary eyed! I'm also British and we have stiff upper lips!  I can only pray this type of effort made by these people will be in Canada soon.  Computer systems with 50 year old parts!!?? This is madness. / []
As I’ve said before, anyone trying to discredit DOGE needs to be looked at. Seriously looked at! / []
Mom is 85 and she doesn’t mind going to the office to show proof of identity. People had their social security and identity stolen, that’s a fact. They open bank accounts and loans without their permission or consent. It’s time to Show proof of who you are with your social security number. This will cut down or prevent theft to vulnerable seniors like my mom. / []
Cannot believe they are insane people out there who resist some common sense and people doing the right things for the greatness of America / []
We have indepth knowledge of what you are doing at DOGE and we appreciate it. But one more area has to be investigated and that is war weapon industry and goverment contracts for defense equipment and materials... I believe we are paying billions and billions more than actual value of goods purchased by government in defense area. Let all procurement be investigated and goods procured from lowest cost manufacturers in the world ..This only step will save trillions in one shot ......   Always available to help. Dewan / []

Does anyone here realize that his boss was the one who increased the deficit by 7.8 trillion dollars in his first term before the pandemic?  This is his debt. And if Musk doesn’t like our government he should go back to South Africa. / []
Great interview. As a veteran and 20 years federal servant in IT I wish what they are saying about IRS and SSA systems was not true but, sadly it is.  I have friends in these agency complain and report through their leadership and document it all but, nothing changes.  In my agency we have issues with our policies and as much as I report and file grievances nothing ever happens.  I wish they would extend retirement options for those lot us under 50 but have over 20 years of service because I would take it.  I love our country and my time in the service but if we really want to fix this problem we need the leadership in the WH to make this happen.    I am not here to start fights and I am sorry for the civilians who lost their job and were not a part of the problem overall but, most Americans agree something has to be done.  Again, great interview.  From an old OIF/OIR USAF Vet! / ["Thank you for your service to our country❤\nBut let me add, Bidens mandate of the cvd sht caused thousands to leave the military and medical fields..\nThis was a horrible overreach to force many to do something they didn't Want to do and cost their jobs, livelihoods and education....pure evil.", "That's awesome! I'm so happy to listen to this", "What you are saying is correct but don't leave out the other part. To upgrade these systems is going to cost A LOT of money. It costs more than a traditional start up because you can't have ANY down time, cannot lose ANY data, and cannot afford ANY additional security vulnerability. So you know a big reason nothing gets down is because they don't have the stomach to ask for the money it'll take to get done, even though it needs to happen. This is the struggle of the government workers that are getting attacked worse than Tesla owners. If EM can start acknowledging some of these things instead of acting like he's the sole genius, he'd be getting much more buy-in.", 'Thank you for your service']
I hope it all works out.. / []
It is contrary to congress to not pay out money congress has alloted. Almost all "cuts" they have made are not wasteful. / []

38:15 Wow, you can tell how irate he is and how much it hurts him as a human. I can sympathize with that. Powerful statement by Musk. / []
The Dems are completely out of it...not based on facts. / []
I don’t believe any of this … let’s start with defense / []
I have a question. Elon saying his goal is to cut a trillion dollars from national debt, can we realistically get rid of the 35 trillion dollars within 4 years or even ever ? / []
And we should just take the word of a bunch of billionaires at face value.   Like we should believe they do this out of the goodness of their heart and decency without any kind of agenda to enrich themselves even further.   These parasites care only about themselves and the bottom line. / []
I thought it was a bunch of 20 year olds that know nothing. Thats a obvious lie / []
Elon Musk and his team need to double down on finding were all the tax dollars are going. Get Trump to preemptively pardon Elon Musk for any legal heat and unleash Grok on the Ukraine funds. Billions are flowing—where’s it landing? Grok was built to crunch data we’d spend decades on. Only way to fight the craziness is to shine a light at the stuff they don't want us to see. / []
Wow, what a great interview with DOGE team. These members are intelligent business minded common sense going forward organizing government business properly! Good job FOX Bret Bart! So refreshing to hear truth from the horses mouth. / []
Love you Elon / []
I ♥ DOGE! / []
Mind-Blowing! Thank goodness for DOGE! / []
WOW!  We are so lucky to have these wonderful men through Trump's administration who have taken time from their lives and jobs to fix America for us all and our childrens future. / []
Elon got the guys in there that the Government could never get on their own.  The bosses would have been scared because these guys are smarter and/or these guys wouldn't have even applied because they can get more elsewhere.  We should ALL be grateful for everything they're doing.  It's literally our money they've been Sh1tting away for decades.... Maybe there will be some there for us and our children to retire. / []
DO NOT SLEEP ON ELONS XEICANTIUM! / []

Congress and the Judicial branch need to get DOGED too but I bet you won’t see any one in those branches asking Elon to come on in. / []
If you only watch this interview you'd think doge is great, but if you watch any real news you'll be horrified by the level of incompetence of these "smart" guys. Many of the savings are false and the 150 year olds are just records in the SSA DB. They are not getting benefits.  Having said that modernization is good, but the new systems must be audited upon launch and ongoing. / []

Very good interview! Useful to understand the big picture on how DOGE works and, even more important, its vision for government’s future. / []
The Doge Team are heroes of our time❤  Thank you for your hard work! / []
Do they think this is performative art!!  Do they not understand when their country goes to hell, that this bullsh^& is available to the world, and everyone is watching. / []
Please understand there are more people who appreciate what you are achieving than there are opposing you. What DOGE have achieved so far is extrordinary. / []

How in the world, that the insanity continues without no alarms: give the navy 12 billion dollars for submarines and no one knows where the money is? Folks, 12 Billion! Is anyone assigned to track this down? How many times has other large amounts have not been unaccounted for? Who here has the ability in their own budget to toss large sums of money away with little concern? Congress is not holding anyone accountable,  there needs to be a mandate to resolve these issues! / []
Thank you God for this group of people that  love this country. Please God I ask you in the powerful name of Jesus to bless them , bless what they are doing  and the most important  request that they and their entire family get to know Jesus=God. All of these I ask in the name of Jesus. / []

It is clear that the elected officials are not smart or honest enough to understand what they should have been doing to run a government. They are clowns and actors and behind them is this empty waste land they seem to benefit from.

Thank you DOGE for all you do!All the Americans with common sense understand and appreciate what your doing for the American people ❤️🇱🇷🙏! / []
I feel that DOGE should look at the future of government contracts, government contracts are ten times more expensive than in the private sector, for example ,if a contractor charges $500,000 to construct a new building in the private sector that same exact building would cost the American 🇺🇸 taxpayers $5,000,000 / []

We know how the Left gets rich now. They take money from taxpayers. How did we not know this! / []
Many Americans have no clue in how many ways their country dodged a bullet by selecting Trump. Well, I guess ignorance is bliss for some. / []
I juste have one question : How much these auditors are paid for their job and how much they saved for the US. I saw somewhere that Elon was paid millions a day for this job. Can you guys drop a financial statement before and after so we have proof. Because for now all we have is talks and no proof of savings  (Ps : I'm not even American but the Trumps policies are going nowhere :)) / []

As a project manager, this reaction by people who are ‘on the left’ is a very clear indication of fear based emotional responses by non-logical minded people. It doesn’t matter how many times or how clear the information is shared that show benefits and a necessary process to obtain success - there are people who will continue - into infinity - to slam and rebel - even after the results prove the success. A high percentage will never ‘see’ or accept truth or even apologise for their mistake - they will defend a false perception.  And criminals will try to hide their crimes too. / []

Brett Baier is sort of the Unsung hero at FOX.  He's not Trump's no.1 fan, but his fair and honest interview of Kamala SAVED this country when it exposed how phony and dumb she really was!  I think that's what gave Donald all the swing states during the election / []

EVIL. Satan was in the White House I didn't like it and kicked out either and seeing Trump too good and fix all the damage they've done you know this is a spiritual warfare it doesn't have anything to do with blue or red / []

Thank you Elon for defunding our radar services in the middle of Tornado season. Very inspiring and necessary. / []

The only reason democrats hate DOGE is because it was a Republican's idea to create it. / []

Brilliant men doing brilliant work and being persecuted for it. Thank you DOGE team! Common sense and accountability in the Federal Government…. FINALLY!!!!  MAGA! / []

It goes to the town hall, that your social security number would automatically be nulled as if it went back into the bingo ball and turned and is no longer available / []
I love all the smart minds in one room. For all in the USA 🇺🇸 we ❤ you to set the standards of being digital. Roll out needs to be globally. / []
Whats life without accountability. If America is a business why not run it like a successful one. I appreciate everything DOGE is doing. Keep up the good work. / []
Thank You Brett for giving Doge this opportunity. Thank You Elon Musk and your AWESOME Team for being BRAVE, TRUE Patriots for our country. / []
Outstanding sit down that really sheds light on the good work this team is doing. His point at the end about despising virtue signaling without a lack of solution was very important here. At surface level, it seems compassionate to want to continue to fund Ukraine to defend itself, but that just promotes more killing and no real peace as a solution, the real Way to end the needless killing is to negotiate a peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine. At the end of the day, we can’t control what Russia decides to do, but if we have a chance to negotiate peace after what’s been done, that is ultimately better for everyone and ends the killing. / []
People aren’t used to the government moving and changing in a breakneck speed like this. It’s fine to be skeptical about whether these tech bros have the ordinary citizens’ best interests at heart, cause we know how humans are inherently self-serving and easily corrupted by money and power. However the left’s reaction to DOGE has been so unhinged. Why can’t Dems be a normal opposition who keeps an eye on DOGE without resorting to vandalism and violence? / []
Elon is on fire!!!! 👏👏👏 / []
Thank God for these amazing men! Thank you for what you are doing! ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸🙏🏻 / []
I will believe what Elon says when he shows proof. Some of his claims have been disproven. I don't trust him or his team at all. / []
I had tears rolling down my face listening to this American patriot hero’s. These men are geniuses putting the government on point. Thank you Elon and President Trump and doge . Salute doge God bless America 🇺🇸 / []
Get this message to NPR AND PBS , let all the liberals hear it for a month, constantly and then refund their propaganda 38:46  machines / ['yes, defund the propaganda  machines!']

Thank you guys for all you are sacrificing to help our broken country. I'm asking God to protect all of you and give you grace and favor. I hope this helps Americans to see what's really going on and not believe the lies of those who have used our tax money as their own piggy bank. / []
President Trump blows the clarion call to wake up the people! Calling on all patriots to pray for America, President Trump, his family, team, Musk, and his family. May the Lord protect America, President Trump, and Musk. I pray in Jesus Christ. Amen. / ['AMEN!❤❤❤😊', '@Ingrid-hi9te🤝🙏']

This groups needs to be on abc, nbc and cbs wake the people up. / []
Elon Musk should run for the next presidential election, and these information videos should be aired and shown to all of the people on the biggest networks. There seems to be hope for the future, and there should be investigations and serious arrests for those found guilty. / []
Democrats are demonic! / []
Great job people / []

If you haven’t listened to this ~ IT’S A MUST!!  It will blow your mind!!! / []
DOGE needs to keep someone with them all the time and make a documentary. Also, Kari Lake for DOGE spokesperson. Elon is not good at it. / []

Democrat liberal main media and talk shows like the view are the one that’s spreading hate speech to get people to hate the president of United States, Elon Musk and his crew. These people need to be defended and sued. / []
I would take anything from this interview if Fox News journalists weren’t cowards about asking the right questions or for the DOGE team to be interviewed by an independent journalist. The gaslighting from this administration is tiring 👎 / []
It’s like the government is basically saying everyone needs a job so: “hey,  you there you’ll be in charge of sharpening pencils”  and to make it more fun we should add 1200 more people to help spread out the pencil sharpening skills / []

the gov knew by the time the boomer are gone, there will be no taxes to give social security to people who actually grew up with computers 😆 / []
This is an absurd characterization. They're lumping real credit cards (~700k) with *travel cards* most of which are unused most of the time and require authorization through a travel program in order to use them at all. / ["...and if you're wondering why there would be so many of them, THINK about it for a second. The govt cannot run a slush fund. It has to segment apporpriated money carefully. It can't mix and match cards across programs."]

Amen amen amen! / []
You know, it hit me while watching this interview that this is the FIRST TIME in my 50 years as an American citizen that I'm NOT feeling overwhelmingly skeptical and cynical about my government. Instead, I'm genuinely hopeful about our future as a nation. There's still a tremendous amount of hard work to be done, but DOGE is a fantastic start. Keep up the phenomenal work, guys. All patriotic Americans who care about our country are rooting for our shared success in this vital endeavor! / ['Agreed', "all patriotic americans didn't vote for a convicted felon to be president that incited J6", 'It’s a breath of fresh air!', '💯 agree', "Because you don't actually intellectually understand what they are doing."]
Is Amy Gleason on the DOGE team? / []
It’s incredible that the Democrats see this as a policy to oppose, the Labour Party in the UK would never be so stupid. Amazing. / []
Wow mind blowing 🤯!! / []
Brett doing a reasonable trying to let all the other guys talk (not just Elon).  There are notable people in this team foregoing lucrative business opportunities to do this. / []
Reminds me of Japan who only recently stopped using Floppy Disks for their government xD / []
I liked DOGE from the beginning and love it even more now. They are doing exactly what this country needs. These people are true patriots. / []
It's about time someone puts a stop to the stealing from we the people. / []
EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THE NATION AND HUMANITY, PLEASE GO OUT TO BUY A TESLA.  Keep in the garage until all this blows over, if you are concerned.  SUPPORT THESE GREAT HEROES. / []
I’m pretty sure if they put this out publicly in the beginning of this process there wouldn’t be so much push back. Why did they wait until now to at least lay out the plan? / []

This is by far the best sit down with Doge I've seen that explains what they are doing, who's doing it and why. Thank You. / []
The left wing media is trying to portray DOGE as a bunch of 19 year olds living in their mom’s basement. They will hide this interview from their audience because it goes against their scare tactics. / []
God bless Elon Musk a true NATIONAL TREASURE! Praying for him and his family’s protection but most importantly their salvation in JESUS THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD! / []

Thank God for  Elon and the DOGE Department / []
The US needs to keep the same energy with Israel that it does with Ukraine. Why is it OK to put Israel’s interest ahead of our own? It’s not okay! / []

finally common sense came back to America. Thanks God. / []
Elon u not even from here and getting all Americans free tax money and contracts for ur company.. u and dad cause all them problems in south Africa and they ran y'all..  go back to lil island Britain where u from / []
Bret, please talk to this team of people (and others) once per month, or at least once every two months. This is super helpful to the American public, especially since left-leaning media is totally ignoring this kind of information. A lot of lies have been spread about DOGE for political reasons, even from top Democrat leadership in Congress. It's insane. / []
FOR WHAT?! / []
God bless DOGE, Elon, and the rest of the patriots on his team for sacrificing their lives, time with their families and friends. They will be remebered as HEROS and Selfless Patriots. Lets show them we support them and appreciate their sacrifice❤🇺🇸🫡 / []
Thank you, Doge team, for the great work! / []
New computer systems are even more expensive than old and anyone in software knows new software nearly never works properly, even after decades of updates. All for updating, but to say it will be done in a few months is bold face lie / ['there are ways to polish and smooth over/ use not the newest greatest software and still have a settled and solid system. you dont have to use windows 10/11 to have a good system', '@caminam78\xa0 I agree, I just speculate that any one is going to bother putting in the effort in the end. I imagine another big dollar figure will get dropped on a new contract and in the end it will still be plagued with problems with no one interested in improving it like the current system.

Doing an awesome job at DOGE🎉 / []
Individual taxpayer debt is over $300,000 and so far DOGE has found about $2,000. This is nothing. GET A GRIP AMERICA!!! You going down if you don’t stop the waste!!! / []
MSM employees have TDS most are former Clinton, Obama, and  Biden staffers. / []
The transparency of this administration is unbeatable! Trump and Elon are the best things to happen to our great nation! ❤ / []
Its how they are firing people I don't care for. Imagine working for 20 years and one day someone walks in says your a waste and fires you with no notice.  losing everything you worked your whole life for. In one day.  I'm all for government efficiency but its also sad to know tnousands of families have no way to pay rent. / ['This happens in the private market as well, many private nongovernment companies do the exact same thing.', '.15 percent have been fired. most are given severance packages or are voluntarily resigning. as told in the interview you are watching']
Only Elon Musk and Mr.Trump can save America. Long live both and their team! / []
Does any one know and can help me understand - when huge amounts of money like that are "out there" for different departments and agencies, WHO is holding the money? Is the money in BANKS in the meantime? I mean, who holds the money while it is being used? Is it banks or does the government have it own systems to hold the money in the mean time??? / ['they have one bank account that they all pulled from. as told in the interview you are watching', '@caminam i missed it. is it a commercial bank or a fed enetity - and while the money is being held, can it be used for other things in the interest of the bank?']

Great interview, Brett. Thanks to the Doge team for this information and their commitment to eliminating this waste. / []
Government waste of billions of dollars at a time is a complete disrespect of those who earn that money. It is NOT the government's money, it is stolen from working Americans. Defund the IRS. / []

Retirement Training is Transition Assistence because Civillian Protocalls and Mission are much Different.  Hopefully it can be done better and Cheaper.  Keep going Guys. The Dems are Creatures form the Pit of Hell along with some Reps. / []
Fabulous interview ! Such eye opening information! So much federal fraudulent spending! Thank you to President Trump and Musk team DOGE 👏🇺🇸 / []
This comment section looks extremely similar to the Tesla townhall comment section. Overwhelmingly positive. Are we to seriously believe no DOGE detractors have watched this video and not left a single comment? How stupid do they think people are? / []
Where these deposits are going for all of these lie payments that’s where we need to get to who is the criminals behind these… where is the paper trail? Who is the people behind? These? Who passed these? That’s what we need to find out not just stop these payments, but find out who approved him who okayed him who this deposit for trillions of dollars is going into whose account.! Full transparency would be to say where the money came is being deposited / []
That was an excellent interview, every American needs to see this! / []
The great yt hope. / []
DOGE is so very, very 'common sense.' Just remember, there are people who do NOT have any common sense.  Also, some people are truly stupid. / []
As someone who has worked in grant funded programs, it's a push me pull you, the administrative staff is rewarded for using all funds by getting a further grant.  Nor can they save the funds for an actually needed purchase over several years. / []

Great great interview. Well done Brett. What a bunch of amazing men. Uk Doge next fellas? 😂 / []

It's a easy task if we don't would stop pushing back.  We could easily cut 2 trillion. Jus go to any video of them talkin numbers.  Those are yearly numbers.  Easily at a trillion now. Hell 350 billion given to another country is almost half of that. / []
It's literraly a war between the Usa and the Lefties ! / []
Its crazy that tax payers like me should be angry with what Doge is doing.  Only criminals will hate this ..why am I busting my butt for some politicians to just use my money anyhow / []

So with Social Security being out of money in a matter of years will some of this money be used to fund Social Security for future generations? When is the Gold audit of Fort Knox occurring? / []

I am a software architect. I almost fell out of my chair when I heard they say they have over 700 IT software systems, 27 CIO's, most who are non technical and the systems do not communicate with each other! For most of you folks that are non IT, this is beyond a nightmare scenario rather a catastrophic failure situation! I hope everyone  appreciates the fact that Elon and his team is doing what Star Trek stated: to boldly go where no one has gone before! I am stunned and Schumer has the audacity to claim that Elon is destroying Social Security! What a complete ignoramus Schumer is! Thank you Elon and team for doing what no one else on this earth is capable or willing! / ['THANK YOU FOR SAYING THIS PLEASE SPREAD THIS INTERVIEW', 'If you really are an architect you must work at tiny companies. Have you worked with any legacy F500 organization? Technical debt?? Systems build over 70 years? Come on now.', 'Schumer is evil and a lying fraudulent monster. That is the reason plain and simple.', '@ivanfrank_ Why would you say that? Anyone who has worked in any hardware/software environment, is completely familiar with those systems. Especially, those of us who STARTED OUT BUILDING THESE SYSTEMS. Technical debt?

Just so happens that I started out working with NASA, and moved to consultant for 35 years with companies like AT&T, CSX, Bank of America and many others including being a CIO of my own company. Obviously your attack as most libs goes is frivolous,  suffice it to say I was supporting Elon and his team, not that he needs it, my post was focused on congratulating his team and encouraging folks to support him as all Americans should. Clearly, you take offense to that.']

Less than .15 meaning 15%? Or less than .15 percent (the word percent not stated..)? / []

Doge are dogesdouchbags😊😊😊😊😊😊 / []
I am from India and I can tell you one common feature of bureaucratic goverments like we have here. It is general apathy sugar coated in "Dont fix it if it is functioning!" principle.  The question that is never asked or discorauged is "How well?". And that is because career bureaucrats likes the status quo and "Dont rockthe boat!" mentality.  And change needs shakedown and severe discomfort. The politicians stays away because they know that they are on a revolving door. Bureaucrats should have term limits. It should not be life long career. It should be aresult oriented career. Making that change is tremedously difficult even in private sector! And again  all bureaucrats are not bad! There are so many with bad experiences whenever they tried to do the right thing and swim against the tide.  There is so much cronyism in these departments. So shaking the tree is going to have all kind of protests. / []
This guy is better suited to janitorial work than his current misadventures. / []

This is absolutely amazing.  DOGE is sooo important!   The left is so scared of what DOGE is doing because it is hitting them in their illegal accumulation of government money.  Keep up the great job! / []
Every US citizen NEEDS TO HEAR THIS! / []
Essentially this is like finding out that a relative has maxed out 15 credit cards and is on the brink of bankruptcy. So you take over, close the accounts, deny their unnecessary spending, and put everything back on track. And the Democrats like Chuck Shumer represent that relative - screaming and crying that they can no longer spend lavishly on luxuries. / []
When DOGE is done helping the government, can they move to help Apple and all the phone companies reduce the scam texts that when we “report and block“ keep happening. / []
All systems are paper systems and all parties are at fault. We got here over decades of complacency…. But as a lifelong lib, I blame the Dems mostly because they pretended to care about an average Joe, being the party of the people, party of civil rights and all that, but now they just became full on spineless terror supporters. I hope Elon does what he says and delivers another win for the GOP! I will never forgive my former party for betraying their own values and their constituents. / []
Most of those fraudulent social security numbers are being used by illegal aliens. Guaranteed.  Any address and name associated with them needs to be given to ICE. / []

"No taxation without representation!" Thank you President Donald Trump. Thank you DOGE. Thank you Elon Musk. / []
That's what the Dems goal was to take the social security and pocket it. To their own pockets / []

There shouldn't be any deficit. / []
Other medias could give them a platform to explain what they’re really doing but they’re too busy spreading hatred and violence towards them. Imagine what this country could accomplish if we could all focus on the betterment of America together. / []

They were going to be armed by our government and then one day they would turn on us before we even knew what was happening….they were and still are school bus drivers that could easily take all the kids hostage….mass casualty evens all over the USA involving all our kids…Gun free zones turned into slaughter houses….think people think 💭…we were doomed in 8 years or less…God bless us all…we need to come together ❤ / []

Non-technical CIOs. Funny, since Elon is a non-technical CEO / []
Wow, we all knew government waste was bad but this report is simply mind blowing. / []
Elon Musk and his team should sit in front of congress and show the skeptics ( Democrats and republicans) what they are doing. This would put on those false accusations to bed! / []

Fantastic interview, every elderly person should watch this to give them peace that DOGE is actually getting them more money in the long run in Soc Security.  And also, leftists should watch this to see the difference between what DOGE is actually doing to what the mainstream media's lying account of what Elon is doing.  Great report on Fox News.  Another Trump success story. / []
Go Elon! / []
Please Pray 🙏 for. Mr. Musk he's being targeted for trying to help USA. The people behind the corruption are trying to Stop him. He's Very Rich and Intelligent if he wanted to abuse the system he could do it without helping us. He has the Intelligent staff to do it without evening help us. It's not brain surgery think about it. God Bless you 🙏 ❤️ / []

Still sounds like they still wont balance the budget. So pointless. We will still go deeper into debt. / []
How can ICE catch criminals and deport them or members of MS13 and law enforcement police officers cannot retrieve the video from the Greenlink bus of the man who touched me unwanted and or strained my shoulder and of the man who showed indecent exposure of genitalia. / []
“Thanks” Elon for “protecting” free speech? Going after people who don’t agree with you! Way to Go! 😂🎉 / []
10:05 - Dems straight out lying directly to the faces of all US citizens that Trump is attacking Social Security.  Can any sane person tell me how they can lie blatantly and get away with it? / []
34:05 freeze this for a moment. What he is saying is exactly the problem with the arab Israeli conflicts. I've seen it and lived it. Its not the Palestinians bit the people pushing them to cause violence. Otherwise they would all get along just fine. And in fact , many thousands do get along. / []
❤❤❤❤❤ / []
And this is the guy they are burning his cars 😒😒 people are dumb 😢 / []
Everybody needs to watch this interview!!!!!  This is pretty darn clear that Elon's group is doing fantastic work. / []

This gives me a sense of comfort that is indescribable.  If you are an honest law abiding American this is the best thing that could ever happen to you.  Go DOGE! / []
Great piece / []
true,... humanity comes firs, regardless of who wins, this war with Russia and Ukraine needs to stop / []
Indians crying 😅😅😅😅 / []
These guys on the DOGE team appear to be some of the smartest & most logical involved in government in a long while. It’s wild the contrast in the types of people in the government and how private sector professionals act and think. You can tell all these guys care about is doing the best job possible like the govt is a private sector company not a giant charity with endless money to waste. Really impressed with this team. / []
Thank you DOGE. You are doing a great job for America and for the American people. / []
... and Democrats are outraaaaaged 😤 / []
It seems great when you take them at their word, but they are serial liars / []
Thank you gentlemen for this great work that you are doing America loves you. God bless you. / []

Will DOGE end the Federal Reserve? / []
Share with all . Im on disability and i have no worries about doge, in fact, i love it.❤ / []
How come no one is being held accountable for these fraudulent and waste besides getting fired. ?  They make all these claims and no arrests ?  Nobody else thinks that’s suspicious? No one… just me huh? / ['Did you see the judge challenging the President about people deported? That is ONLY ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM!']
Why isn’t this being covered in main stream media???? Incredible hiding and gaslighting of the American people / []
They will give any and everybody money but the black man fr smh😂💯🤫 / []
Thanks to Brett Baier , this interview was very dry and I support the efforts of the doge team one hundred percent. / []
Thank you all together / []
GOVERNMENT SERVICE IS SUPPOSED TO BE VOLUNTARY AFTER BEING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. NEVER MEANT TO BE A CAREER. / []
More not less, so stop thinking Elon is going to take anything away! / []
Can we get rid of this liar already? / []
Anyone who misses a cheque should be compensated. Not much but just a little to show the people that the government is away that late payments cause the people problems. Sometimes their direct debits are late and they get charges. I just think it would help them look like they care. / []
I'm So Thankful to God, this is Happening 🙏 Thankful for President Trump and His whole Administration. Our American was Being Stolen from us. Praise God! 🙏 / []
The anshutz family owns hotels at the national parks. They’re not paying $800m for the surveys. They’re upcharging our government for the survey. Our tax payer money. They’re frauds. / []
I thank these men for their hard work and dedication. I am puzzled as to why would anyone not want the fix these financial issues in our nation????? I also love how transparent these men are. / []
This shows how inept and corrupt ALL past governments have been!!!! / []
-Who drives the car on mars? / []
if he remove his own conflict of interests would be great program / []
This is the work that Trump told us, during the campaign, he would task Elon with. So when I voted for Trump for president, I also voted for Elon and for DOGE! 🎉 / []
Once you lads are done fixing the U.S, can you all come down to Australia 🇦🇺 and fix our government mess? / []
Thank you DOGE!!! / []
Yeah this isn't Carnegie, Hurst, Rothschild, Morgan and Vanderbilt making power plays. These are patriotic Generals leading a bloodless revolution  to reestablish our independence and preserve our most valuable asset of freedom. / []
“Like what do you mean a mine”🤣👍😃so ludicrous. Thankyou Elon and all these brave, very smart team you’ve put together you are all doing a fantastic job.👍👍Elon you and your team are doing a great service for your country 👍👍👌😃 / []
They should have a digital feed showing the debt and subtracting the amount saved everyday. To prove the amazing saving. Thank you!! / []
If the Fed Govt.before Trump...ran walmart and amazon...those 2 giants would collapse before those govt workers filling in for the actual walmart employees.. even gets to pass probation period / []
Anyone who doesn’t like Elon and this team has themselves been stealing from us / []

Put the for the people back in the Constitution, 1871. They rewrote the Constitution put  corporation corporate then of the people not 4 the people. Amazing how corrupt our government is. 16th amendment enabling the government to collect tax. How many states ratified that. One and a half. All a lie. Freedom to fascism documentary hour and 48 minutes long. There is no law the IRS agents can point to that we have to pay tax, until you put a tax system to them. Corruption that it's finest. Let's not talk about the money laundry. / []
What about subsidies to private companies / []

Elon Musk got Federal Funds each day. 8 Million usd. He is the last person on Earth to tell others how you run a Company. He have NO right to speak about Freedom of Speech. His Family Ties in South Africa and his X Social Platform who ban users without reason. Reporters and News Stations. Podcasters and just against his Dictatorship support. / []
Anybody that listens to this and disagrees does not have the best interest of the country or the people at heart. Elon is like all the hard working honest immigrants who come here, apreciative of the opportunity to be here, protective of what we have and a desire to give those who come after us even more opportunity. / []

The mechanical system may not know that a social security number belongs to a baby, but a person doing what they should would immediately know that it belongs to someone underage or not qualified.

DOGE claims to have found Social Security loans going to 11 year olds and under. It's a survivor benefit annuity to young children whose parents have passed. It's hard to imagine anything more cartoonishly villainous than stealing survivor benefits from orphans, lol. / []

I was so happy to hear DOGE's team voices explain what they are actually doing and discovering: even though the facts cut deep.  Seeing how hard-earned, taxpayer money, given/taken by the Federal government is stolen under our noses, moved out quickly and dispersed to strangers et al without any consent by the people.   Thank you to Elon, his brilliant team and President Trump for seeing the great benefit to the people of the United States and the world.  In no time, I believe many other governments will courageously take up this process for their own people.   Much thanks again and I look forward to every cost-savings you make on our behalf.

Yeah amen to the calls into change someone’s bank Info I got a letter from social security stating they received my change of bank routing and account info…..Not I didn’t do that so I called and they changed it back …I was lucky good thing social security sends letter to my current address or I ewoildnt have caught it because that was just before the 3rd of the month of May or I would have lost my social security All the scammers had to do was call in that isvridiculous / []

the idea that these guys are trying to steal anything is ridiculous, some are the most successful people in the world! they don't need to do this, they could be on vacation year round enjoying life but they truly care about the state of our country and want to lend their knowledge. thank you president Trump and DOGE 🫡 / []

Oh I can't wait till 2026 gonna vote OUT all Democrats wooo / []
“We routinely encounter wastes of a billion dollars or more… casually.” / []
Describing Federal gov as a one way rachet - nailed it! / []
And by they doing these interviews, it’s them showing through action. Hey guys we understand everyone’s concerned about the shoot from the hip and all the hate the Democrats are saying but we’re trying to look you guys get on TV and explain everything they’re not hiding from it, they’re trying to be as open and honest as you can be and again if you go with the aiming approach, it could take 20 years, so yes, sometimes have to make mistakes in order to get thereand my guess is they’re gonna work on this for 110 days maybe 210 days and then Elon’s gonna go back to his life / []
So happy you’re bringing AMERICA back to normal! The administration’s previous (not President Trump) has blown our country out of control and common sense!! Thank you Elon and your team!!! ❤ / []

Ty for this interview / []
I don't disagree with the credit card statements but if you do not work for the federal government you probably don't know that EVERY Government Vehicle has a credit card assigned to it.  So there could be more credit cards than normal, BUT 2.3 million more than people is suspect for sure. / []

😎👍 / []
I paid over $3,000 in taxes last year and got back $500 as a refund. I know it’s not a lot paid, but I don’t make a lot either. DOGE showing just how much money has been wasted makes me want a refund of all of the taxes I ever paid. Clearly they have all gone into the pockets of the political elite and that’s why they didn’t want Trump in office. They didn’t want their cash cow sent to a safe place. / []
How is anyone upset with this happening / []
What a smart team! The world should be watching this. THIS is how a government should endeavour to function / []
Very eye-opening! Thank you for putting this interview together. / []
This program should be archived for future generations. Elon Musk and the others are giving back to America and that is the most patriotic thing any person can do!!!!! / []
I truly believe that this needs to be shown. It was nice seeing these other gentlemen who have left their jobs per se temporarily to help our country, which is unbelievable. This needs to be shown on TV more and also everything that Trump has done and also mostly all the companies that are gonna be coming to the US and start jobs.  People need to see this so Daley you know when the news is on and when you look at stocks and bombs and they’re running across the top of the screen, this is how they need to constant keep showing what jobs are coming to the USA ❤ / []
Thats why i voted for Trump hes a good man with a good heart but when need be he can be a beast and i mean that in a good way trump 2028 hell yea / []
Elon is awesome 💯😎 / []

This is exactly what happened back in my country argentina. I don't understand why people don't like this. Really crazy how some American people complained and called Elon crazy. / []

ELON!! GO AFTER STATE PROPERTY TAXES!!😊😊 / []
Seems really great! I'm just kinda worried about the informationpocalypse when Gov. starts rewriting documents, history.. "truths" essentially.

Nearly 40% of contracts canceled by Musk’s DOGE are expected to produce no savings. However, you won't hear that in this so called "interview". / []
I absolutely admire this team of Patriots. Desiring to straighten out all the issues that previous administrations have just ignored. Ignoring these issues not caring that their constituents tax payers are just dooped week after week and its turned into decades of this negligence.

Private enterprise individuals are incapable of comprehending the obligation of governance and service to the people through a nation which costs and never will recuperate or profit from government activities. You need big government in order for a government to do big things and the economy should be a mix of big government and big private so the government can steer and manourvers the country to where it wants to be - this is great theatre but enforces how ridiculous the whole DOGE is / []
Wonder who was running all these scams / []
Or you could use tax efficiency tax exemption applied to their taxes so they see it. / []

This was the most informative bits of information I’ve seen regarding DOGE and what and why they are doing what they do. It’s refreshing yet frustrating that people will never see it and disregard it even if they do. That’s beyond the pale and makes me wonder about the why. People need to be exposed charged and if found guilty sent to prison. I don’t care if they are elected officials or judges quick even justice for everyone. / []
This is all BS / ['Please explain why that is so, and please provide factual information and not biased information.

Why does Trump want to raise the national debt even higher while giving the top 1% a massive tax cut in his latest bill? Wouldn’t that help lower US debt? Something just feels off about all of this, just me? / ["You didn't actually watch the interview did you? o.O", '@ Go do actual research instead of listening to this propaganda. Trump’s Tax plan includes $4.5T worth of tax cuts, most of which will be for the top 1%, aka adding 4.5 TRILLION to the current $1.9T deficit. \n\nSo do you really believe DOGE and Elon are going to reduce government spending by anywhere close to that number? If you do, you already drank the kool aid, but I hope really do some research outside of Fox News. Gov spending was $6T in 2023 and 2024 respectively, let’s hope Elon can reduce government spending by 75%.

Impressive interview.  The provides transparency and lets people know what it‘s all about. Support Elon and DOGE team.  Proud of them all and keep it up with the great work 👍👍👍 / []
Phenomenal Interview! / []
Elon and DOGE team.. please be encouraged that there are far far more with you than against you. These morons that are against you will be proven wrong 🙏 / []
...we need to bring back more like that: thrice and daft ::nods:: / []
dems have been stealing from us for decades / []
For what? Nothing. Exactly. Politicians telling a country they are going to war for false reasons. America has done this many times over the past 30 years.. it’s time to get the traitors and disgusting people out of politics and acknowledge those politicians publicly in other countries who do the same to their people over greed and power. Don’t work with them. If America cared about a nations people was treated they would have intervened with China years ago but our corrupt politicians never did because the way China treated there people benefited the pockets of politicians in America. Corrupt / []
Elon Musk is the idiot's idea of an intelligent person. / ['\u200b@benwheeler4223  Hegseth has Yemen on his chin too😮']
Virtue signal with the lives of others. / []
Great insight. Dems have lost their never loving minds to oppose this and are just blatantly demonizing Doge for political reasons. / []
All the anti trump/musk people are screaming for "proof". Please, give them some proof. I love what y'all are doing but you need to be much better at communicating and divulging all of this. / []
Beyond thankful for these men. I hope the fraudsters are held accountable and made to pay restitution / []
Any anti Elon propaganda is low IQ / []
Elon is probably one of those most significant humans in my entire life.   The work he’s doing will be looked on in the future as life saving, even civilization saving maybe. / []
Outstanding job guys.  Elon is a once in a lifetime find!!!!!! / ['There are actually many ceos that brought their way into a position and lie to people', 'Once in multi generations', 'Oh yeah a billionaire totally cares about you lol 😂🤣', '\u200b@loraldinp2624\nWhat have you done for anyone besides yourself?!', '@loraldinp2624 Well not one dem does so I will take Elon in a heartbeat.']
We all knew the government was corrupt and stealing our money!! Thank the Lord our prayers have been answered!! Politicians and their families, judiciary, everyone connected have set up the Biggest scam money laundering scheme ever in the history of the world!!! We need to pray everyday for these Great Brave People who are Taking back our country and Money and the American government 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
11:38 ✅✅✅ / []
And to think, this has become so unthinkable over a hundred plus years by all political parties. The old joke of the hammer costing $xxxxx is real. States are not as bad but have bloat. Local governments are much better. / []
We get paid by the month by how much you find that’s fair then we can’t complain? / []
Musk should not be involved in war briefings / []
Thank you so much. The gentleman in the back nods his head and looks like he agrees completely.  😊 this is fantastic❤ / []
Tomorrow you find they’re wasting money on hotdogs for pigs studies . Every American gets a dollar. / []
you all are deleting negative comments / []
Feier ich. Freue mich hart auf deinen Schami! / []
That was great. I love that everyday Americans who are outside the system are fixing the system. It gives me chills. Keep up the great work! ❤ / []
Don’t mine at night 😂 / []
I don’t know how you could be against this / []
Any DOGE people look into the Clinton Foundation yet? / []
Elon is a real patriot! / []
Great conversation!! We need more of this. Love to see young people solving this mess! Welcome to the 21st century. / []
On line survey - gives every American $1.00 / []
Thank you! / []
I would like to see a team in place to look into the insurance companies. Premium coverage has gone up for Medicare and insurance supplement coverage so much that it is very difficult to afford to continue coverage. / []
Classic liberal criticism...cant back anything up with an example or a fact. "Which line do you disagree with" ..." errrrr orangeman and rocketman bad" / []
Measure twice if not trice, cut once. I see how that’s working out in this process, firing many people from NNSA or other agencies and realizing they need to be hired back. YOU’RE A JOKE. / []
This is what an idiot who's in over his head looks like / []
Very informative. Thank you / []
Thanks to these true Patriots! / []
Please start with the dictionary.  Trumps behavior personifies the term.  Please be careful when you use the name of Jesus Christ as though it were your identity.  He will hold those responsible who prop up and support evil actions toward our fellow man. / []
PROUD OF ELON MUSK AND ALL ENGINEERS ❤❤ / []
How lucky are we that we got Trump elected and Trump had the common sense to ask Elon and his team to help? This is the most transparent administration we have ever elected to our government. / []
Wow these guys look horrible for 19 and 20 year olds / []
Go on Elon and the gents! The last few sentences on the topic of Ukraine and virtual signallers was very heartfelt by Elon and just shows his deep empathy for humanity. / []
Are they hiring? Would love to work for doge / []
We are so proud, thank you for all you are doing. Excellent team. / []
Bravo to true American Patriots & Hero's / []
I can’t believe that somebody on welfare wouldn’t be pissed off. If their money was being spent on (———). Let’s just say whatever you’ve come up with a spin on that stupid that you tell the people on public assistance or every American gets one dollar back for every money that you find that they spend on something stupid you could have it had that title here’s something they’re spending money on that stupid today and then just make that list for everybody to see every day / []
Wow big balls himself / []
Thanks to Trump and Elon and the rest of the patriots, helping save America 🇺🇸 and make it great 👍🏻 again 😮😢 / []
My Elon is working for My Trump who is working for My People 🇺🇸😎 / []
Excellent work guys!!!! / []
Again disingenuous at best, the verification of the legitimacy of the gov bank payments happens much earlier in the process at every given agency. Who's bank verifies their payments a 2nd time before they pay? / []
Stay strong Elon! We are behind you and appreciate you and your team / []
We almost witnessed the collapse of civilization with Joe and his ilk. / []
It makes me very sad to see how people have turned on Elon Musk. No wonder Jesus didn’t stand a chance. Bad people control our lives through hate. / []
Dear democrats, I challenge you to react to THAT! / []
This is so strange, he is not a govt official, why does he have all this power? / []
Let’s share this video… / []
Incredible work! Please come the UK next 😅 / []
THANKU  FOX AND THIS  EXCELLENT REPORTER, JOURNSALIST, HOST!!! / []
Wish they would do this in britain & show what the idiots running our country are wasting our  money on / []
This only Shown in Fox News.  and theres the Irony that Liberals Are getting Cencored by the Mainstream Media / []
Excellent imterview! / []
We really need a DOGE team in  Canada!! / []
Stacy Abram’s was paid $2 Billion for her fraudulent voting tactics to help Biden win. Mark my words. She’s gonna snitch. / []
Excellent interview and information sharing. America demands government cut the waste now! / []
THE HOST HERE IS EXCELLENT,  DOESN T INTERRUPT, AND  IS FAIR AND PROFESSIONAL, / []
Why does doge systematically overstate the amount of money it saves the country? / []
So glad they are finding these things. I hope by the end of this year, all Social Security recipients  will have those extra funds and no taxes. / []
Thank you Elon Musk and amazing DOGE TEAM!!! Praying for your safety and protection always and that includes your love ones❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏 / []
❤❤❤ / []
I hope they cut it like 75% there’s so much crap and so many freeloaders / []
Left totally devastated America / []
INCREDIBLE, HISTORY CHANGING WORK!!  LONG, LONG OVERDUE! / []
Government travel cards🤷🏾‍♂️ / []
This clown changed because of his gahy son😂 glad his company falling, ruined forsure lol / ['I’m not even here to flame your comment. Im genuinely asking. I get that the drama around Elon and his son is a bit silly, and I personally don’t feel the same way. But considering neither of us knows a perfect human, because they don’t exist, can we not agree that a lot of the changes being implemented are solid?']
Doge team is saving our tax dollars from greedy people and corruptions. / []
*It’s the media that spreads leftist propaganda.* / []
Change is uncomfortable. Big change is extremely emotional. / []
Germany: Watch this! / []
My process took 2 years or 24 months like they put it, to make it sound less horrifying, I have to continue working but that has nothing to do with anything, I wanted  my pension because I paid for it. / []
23:06 Elon claim He have learned something. / []
GOD BLESS ELON AND HIS DOGE TEAM!!! ❤❤❤ / []
From me and my family, thank you DOGE. / []
As a American citizen, only speaking for my self thank you too you and your team. People who want to see what your doing are very impressed and appreciated what y’all are doing. Thank you. Not that it matters but I’m not a dem or republican. But I do believe in trump and musk. / ["I'm sure you do Boris xD", 'You American?']
Thank you / []
which one is big balls? / []
Thank you Fox News great news! / []
I love DoGE!!! How can anyone not agree with what they are doing ??? Keep going guys !!! We need to protect these guys by educating the ppl around us !! Be DOGE evangelists / []
Being successful means you will constantly be scrutinized by those who are not successful. / []
I strongly believe Elon Musk. He lives so modestly in spite of his billions. He does everything with a pure heart. He has contributed so much to humanity. STOP THE HATEFUL PROPAGANDA! STOP THE VANDALISM!! Like Elon says: “we’re going to get you”. These criminals WILL pay!! / []
I love these freaking nerds🤓💪🏾 LFG! / []
Applying private processes for efficiency and transparency to government. Brilliant. You all are beyond amazing / ['transperacy???😂 Have they shonw theyr own incomes???You little fools follow billionaires!All they care about is theyr money and power!Never will a billionaire care about you little fools 😂 How can you be so blind!Made up nummbers and made up activities!!!!']
Go DOGE 🦊!!!!! We love all these efforts!! Once in a lifetime opportunity- That is why the deep state and communist Democrats are losing their minds! / []
Not really a report😅 / []
Does anyone ever tell them good job !! Thank you! / []
The people behind DOGE headed by Elon Musk should be given the Presidential Medal of honor. They are doing such a great job to fix the corruption in the federal government. Thank you for all the things that you do. / ['Yes', '💯', "His savings figures are all incorrect, they don't even know what databases are active and inactive. They don't know what programming languages are used for many of the back-end data feeds, or front-end access apps.", 'Please list the corrupt officials, and what department they worked in', 'can they be transparent enough to show all the findings? i guess we have the right to comb it through too']
This was a great interview. I believe that in seeing and knowing who is doing this work makes DOGE personable.  These are real people, giving of their time, to help our country, because they care, and see the danger this Nation is in. Thsnk you. / []
A huge thank you to Fox News and to Mr Baier for this presentation. It was long overdue only because of the ridiculous pushback DOGE has received. They are wonderful American heroes who shouldn't have to explain themselves imo but thank you for bringing this to worried Americans being misled by the radical left villains. And above all, Thank you to my hero Elon and his incredible team of patriots that will forever be known, along with President Trump, for saving our country. We the people, love and respect you DOGE! / []
Thank you so much for what you guys are doing. You guys didn't have to but you guys chose to for the country. Thank you. / []
Russia said clearly what territories they want. They still not there. So they keep this war. Support to Ukraine is helping to hold frontlines where they are. If Ukraine stops, more peaceful Ukrainian people will die and be forced out of their homes. It’s not rocket science to understand 😢 / []
I think the mine was pretty cool / []
Being a software engineer this is fact. / []
I’m just a little confused because if we are so broke that ssi is in danger then why  are we buying  a new fleet of f47 fighter jets from Boeing. / []
Awesome keep going DOGE / []
Thank you Doge Team😊 / []
🇺🇸Americans are lucky to have patriots stepping up, sacrificing their own interests to save the country from bankruptcy and more. God bless all DOGE members, President Trump and Elon Musk, God bless America! / []
I have to say I love Elon and Trump. I’m an old lady and this all scares me. / []
No wonder the establishment is pissed, their slush funds are being shut down. / []
If the rich were paying their fair share in taxes, and the IRS had enough agents to actually audit them for what they owe, we could EASILY cover 1Trillion EVERY year. They are starting with the wrong part of this problem. Everything they are doing SCREAMS, "how do we tax the rich less?" you are being lied to. / []
THESE ARE TRUE HEROS!!!!! PATRIOTS ! Thank you to the Billionaires they care enough about America to put their life on the line to fight for us! / []
Thank You DOGE Team!!!!❤️✨🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
This should be going viral / []
Democrats can't steal in an efficient, well run government.... Republicans can't either. / []
Thank you Musk 😊😊😊 / []
Sounds impressive! / []

Everyone American Needs To See, Hear, and Understand this. / []
These Men are American heroes. They should have a ticker tape parade for them. / []
Mission: steal the Americans money! / []
I am so proud of Elon and his team. He is 100% accurate that the people opposed to what they are doing are frauds and corrupt. / []
5:42 “Hey, what you’re doing is unconstitutional and illegal”  Elon: “I saved you some money though” / []
Notice NO DEI was applied to this DOGE board. It will succeed / []
Stop waging wars and interfering in other nations’ affairs, and you’ll eliminate the deficit in no time. / []
This team is amazing! Thank you for you determination! / []
This is what happens when hyper-intelligent, principled, patriotic, (mostly) White Men take charge. / []
A bunch of white men in suits, serving and protecting another bunch of white men in suits. / []
DOGE men and women,  Thank you for your service and sacrifices for the United States. You should show the us people how much you make an hour so they can see what your time spent away from your private businesses costs you personally. I don’t think people in general understand your worth and skills / []
Love DOGE! Keep going Elon! / []
This should be VERY eye opening to those who are or WERE still asleep. / []
Tax cuts for the rich is not how you get out of debt for a country. / []
20 somethings in sneakers and skinny jeans? Quite the contrary. Meet the executive team that is conducting the DOGE investigation. This interview provides proof that there are patriotic, selfless Americans who will still come together, without fanfare or compensation, to save our nation.  This interview is inspiring. / []
Outstanding and exceptional team, Tom Krause (make sure it’s just one bank account, and if it is in fact one, consider it LUCKY👍) it’s possible we need a law to require the SEC standards, review and audits for government entities, just as we have it for private sector public companies. In addition I would create “system communication department” to ensure all govt systems have proper security and multiple checks and balances from multiple external agencies such as CIA, SEC and DOGE. (Everything needs TRIPLE VERIFICATIONS and reconciliation) / []
I don’t see what the problem with this is. They are explaining the government waste. They are transparent. This is a good thing. Why are Democrats complaining and the left? No more cash cow who moved my cheese it’s not your cheese. It’s the taxpayers cheese. / []

AI is a group of engineers and developers who optimize systems such as SSN, Medicaid, Medicare, IRS, and other government offices.

23:31 💯 the fraudsters are screaming the loudest and having tantrums / []
They're on a mission from God. Some people on this planet have a moral compass, it's not always about money. / []
The simplest thing to support this message is to hit the LIKE 👍 BUTTON / []

Why don't they have senior security - police  on their team - that initiate the arrest of all of these villains and fraudsters? / []
Thank you so much for the work you are doing. / []
How come mainstream media made it out for us to believe that these were a bunch of teenagers doing this job ? / []
Thank you for dispelling the myth that the DOGE team are computer-hacking teenagers! Go DOGE Team. Thanks for helping to make America great again!! / []
There is no way that you can listen to this and see the work that DOGE has done and be mad at it. Thank you all for your selfless service in saving our country ❤❤❤ / ["I've been living well of the pension of my 126 year old great grandma, and I don't like this DOGE guys at all! Just kidding...DOGE is doing a good job, thumbs up"]
I agree with Elon Musk why are people dying for a course? There’s no reason for it. It’s a shame so many people are dying between the virus the wars we could be a species that is in jeopardy. If everything continues the killing is unnecessary and he breaks my heart to see it and hear about it. / []
The democrats are the party of evil, lies, violence and criminals / []
there wasn't one measure much less "thrice"... vets terminated for performance, whose last performance review was top notch.   The goal is great, the way its being implemented is an egregious attack on a lot of hardworking people / []
Perfect example of being unburdened by things that have been. / []
It is mind boggling that any American can' t see the good that is being done today by President Trump, his Cabinet, and especially the Doge team. Use your brain people and stop listening to the war mongers on the Left!! / []
It is very sad and VERY CONCERNING that we can’t work TOGETHER as a country to work through this, support Elon and his crew, to save and make better our country!  It makes NO SENSE why democrats are upset and fighting this - really makes you wonder, doesn’t it? / []
Thank you DOGE team and thank you Elon!!  We support you 100% / []

How on earth do people still get themselves to believe what any Democrat are saying  about these incredible people? Do these people enjoy to suffer?

Causation… “I’m in the process of retirering my now ‘disabled’ husband from a major US corporation. It’s been 112 anguishing days of pounding on a corporate network wall with no real HR support. HR functions are divided and sub-contracted out. Nightmare. No one from the time I said “help please,” explained the “ our situation or options,” or has guide me through this process. NO checklist. They’re all behind the corporate wall. No one would digitally or paper send me those pages.  In the mean time we’ve lost our health insurance, because I didn’t know. (Verbally told many different things.) I’m told it may be months before govt adds us to Medicare. Govt wouldn’t allow Medicare, we were paying into HSA. “On-line (documents, yes) is not always best.  How will Doge integrate the human factors, assistance and compassion ?” Make it functional for all?  Doge please do this from (undercover boss) perspective.  I believe in Doge. Please review the whole process including the exceptions “like my husband. He can’t do it for himself.” Look at the retirement process completelly. / ["I'm sure they will get an AI bot to do all of that. Will be great until it isn't."]

The problem is when the demon-rats get their hands back on the levers of power again, this will be ALL undone in a few months.

Stumps me how so many folks aren't concerned at all with $36T debt and climbing!!  We need a constitution amendment making it unlawful for congress to pass a budget running a deficit (unless during a congress declared wartime measure)   This has become a normal day of life for America.

Great job Team Doge! I'm surprised how many people seem upset by all this granted it appears that it doesn't matter what good President Trump and his staff do its  considered EVIL. Rescuing our fellow American astronauts for instance.🤔 / []
Great work guys!!! / []
Lmfao, no wonder the socialists, and commies are melting down… this makes absolute logical sense. / []
Eric Weinstein is right!!!!  The scientists are be managed to fail and guided away from making new discoveries.  And i stand with Elon on all of this, this is what real American’s want. / []

Musk is Satan and lies about everything. / []
Cutting workforce without proper evaluation leads to more inefficiencies rather than efficiencies. The focus must be wasteful spend - which needs deeper evaluation and audit. But DOGE appears to be rushing to show results and making mistakes in cutting down workforce. This is not private sector, but public service / []

Mr Bret Thanks. Danke  Germany😅 / []
Some of this is people in a job who only care is their paycheck, similar to Congress..... / []
We want to reduce spend by 1 trillions while give a 4.5 trillions tax cut to wealthy. I know he is a genius but was did yrump sign this 4.5 trillions tax cut for the wealthy?

Keep up the good work Elon! 🇺🇸 / []
How could anyone be against this? You would have to be a totally indoctrinated fool. / []
DOGE ❤ / []
From some of these comments, it is evident accounting and finance needs to be required courses in our schools again. / []
So nice to have so many billionaires involved making decisions to our government.  When Clinton did his doge, the process involved congress, the cutting involved going to the manager in each department, cutting mostly middle management Hey, it's only going to take a few weeks to convert the SSI system?????

The DOGE has accomplished so much in this short period of time, Elon Musk and the whole team is doing fantastic work / []
My question 🙋‍♂️ is who will be held accountable? White collar and Blue collar criminals are living and making the best out of the risk of hustler. But here are poor ppl doing crimes to survive and being sentenced to life imprisonment!! / []
Thank you doge!  These are basic principles of business. Thank you. / []
Very deep interview / []
This is amazing. The left told me these are all nazi’s 😂 / []
DOGE is amazing, should have been done long ago. These men should be celebrated, not punished / []
If the DOGE team would have sat in and reviewed and analyzed government contracts and made informed decisions and implemented savings that way I doubt the American people would have had a problem but just going forward and turning off the lights to every government agency is just insane behavior. They know exactly what they’re doing and that’s privatizing everything. / []
This was phenomenal. Elon talking about the war hits differently. Love and respect his passion. / []
But why didn’t we meet big balls? 😂 / []
Who is ensuring the ‘found money’ isn’t be stolen by these foreign hackers? / []
In like 50 years they'll still make jokes about the democrats being butthurt. / []
we always knew the gov was corrupt but did now know how they were taking our money. / []
Anyone getting money from a dead person needs to be stripped of everything they have and deported / []

God speed patriots / []
If I saw pro Canada dialogue in a leaked private chat between cabinet members like the pro US dialogue in the signal leak I’d be thrilled. If Our politicians conversations were exposed it would show them discussing how to further CCP and transnational globalization agendas. You Americans are truly blessed to have patriots running your government. / []
It is an absolute pleasure to see these genuine people who actually care about the American people doing what’s best for us.  It truly reveals the resistance of the democrats to be fraudulent (as Elon points out).  We the people are with you and are grateful for your service! / []
God bless these patriots and protect them / []

There is nothing transparent about this pathetic and honestly disgusting interview. I listened to it open minded. It reminded me of the interviews that CEO’s at Enron or Lehman Brothers used to give right before going BROKE. Pure lies to the face of the American public, pure propaganda.

Well buddy, when h stand on stage with a chainsaw and say you are going to ruin peoples lives, it typicallly gets a reaction.

Your true power lies in advocating for these 7 essential needs for everyone —clean air, water, nourishing food, peaceful sleep, safe shelter, meaningful connections, and the ability to create from the heart space. This aligns with the fundamental rights of every human being. By fostering awareness and collaboration, we can work towards a world where everyone has access to these vital resources, supporting our well-being and community resilience. Let's unite to ensure these needs are met for all!  Our health and well-being become the true riches in life. Having an abundance of our needs can create peace on earth.  🌎💚 / []
Let’s put it this way, if my tax dollars are being spent on animal experimentation for gender surgery (like transgender surgeries on mice) 😕 I think animal experimentation is cruelty and disgusting.  I might look the other way if it is life saving efforts, but satisfying people’s fantasies is not a government goal.  This one way our money was being spent repulsed me.  Scary.  What else was going on? / []
This is both difficult and hopeful to listen to. / []

Really impressed with this team.', 'Can DOGE please come to South Africa and do the same.

I do want to provide some context. I support a lot of what doge is doing, however I do disagree with characterization of payments. Within agencies, when we have contracts we have to authorize the payment and certify services or supplies are received. This then goes to treasury for payment. It is not treasuries job to verify why payment is being made. They are completing the transaction. This would be like trying to make your local bank verify why you are buying a coffee.

To all the people that are upset at DOGE.. you are right... this is not their job to streamline the Government. it's the job of CONGRESS!!

"we'll show you what they're finding", said by Fox News in reference to Doge. While I entirely agree that money is being wasted and it's a necessity spending can be cut due to streamlining of services, Doge isn't actually showing us, the public, anything. It's a panel of billionaires discussing what they are potentially doing. We, the public, need to see facts and figures. If they are achieving exactly what they are claiming and they are being transparent, ie showing the tax payers what they are achieving, then they are beyond criticism imo. But we need hard data.I see many comments lauding Doge, based on nothing but hearsay from the guys on the team with Elon Musk. Facts, Figures, Evidence. Let's see it.   In other news, Whiskas cat food manufacturers reduced their 100g cat food pouches to 85g, the price hasn't reduced. Whiskas claim they have done this because research shows cats don't tend to eat a full pouch at each meal. I have three cats, none are overweight, all in great health, I am now having to feed them an additional meal a day because one pouch is not enough! Whiskas claim there is research, where is it, where is the data to back up their claims? / ['Well Herb, It takes a little time to collect all the facts and figures u want to  see , and the results of it all may take a little longer still. u think?😅 Time is ur enema Herb😮', "@Nowoke4me You're missing the point, Nowoke4me. Does it not concern you that Fox News states they are going to show what Doge are achieving, which amounts to a group of billionaires talking? We aren't being shown anything as yet. Of course it's going to take time, but so far, it's talk. There needs to be transparency. e.g. digitalising that mine of paperwork is going to take a bank of people considerable time, where's the set up for that? Let's see the structure. \nI'd rather have thyme in an enema."]

It’s one thing for DOGE to deem a survey for $1 billion dollars waste, it’s another to deem entire agencies to be wasteful and cut their staffing by half rendering them essentially closed without formal congressional review. The critics don’t all just blindly hate DOGE, they want due process. / ["They do, though. They don't want due process they want delaying, so it ends up failing.

I thought people here supported "do your own research". So now suddenly the top billionaire of the world, grown up in apartheid South Africa in a racist family is suddenly more trustworthy than institutions consisting of a bunch of normal people. All the positive people in the comments: You are drinking the cool-aid. I guess losing credibility is not a concept anymore. This feels like an abusive relationship.

His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s.

Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup.

I want to share a personal experience here that is a small example of the large fracture in our govt systems. I'll summarize to make this read easy. My brother was receiving Medicaid and wanted to willfully change (due to new/increased income) over to a marketplace plan. He signed up, registered, and paid Cigna for his new plan, while simultaneously canceling Medicaid. Medicaid then turned around and forcefully told him, "You're not allowed to change to marketplace unless we tell you so, and only after we review your income." He said, "Why, I don't need Medicaid any longer, and I'm doing what is right according to my income so you no longer need to provide me with FREE Medicaid." They forcefully replied "Because that is our policy and we make those decisions for you." True and 100% accurate story here folks, I'm not kidding! Imagine a system that won't allow you to voluntarily change and pay based on your increased income! So yes, he's still on Medicaid until someday they tell him otherwise. / ['Tldr']

I am a software engineerer and to me this makes a lot of sense, what Musk and his people say. Often there are a lot of really old systems which are extremly inefficent. Not only in government but also in the private sector(but in the government its probably worse). Also its not only IT-systems. I can very well imagine that every-day systems nobody cares about are also extremly inefficient.  Why is inefficiency bad somebody might ask? Well, it basically effects your wealth and how much effort you have to take to maintain your wealth. When half the country is occupied with useless activities people don't have jobs like -engineer -doctor and medical personal -scientiest -security -many other services which are important  As a result somebody has to work more hours for the same amount of wealth(=combined amount of goods and services)  What Elon does really is the next step for developing civilization. Garbage-collection is extremly important, else systems will fail due to its bloat. The problem is that people tend to add content to a system but don't care about removing content which is either unnessessary or even harmful.  Unfortunatly there are a lot of people who take advantage of inefficiencies and inconsistancies. This is why Musk is hated so much. These people who live with/by the inefficiencies are actually poor people (because their live resolved around doing useless stuff). / []

Our Gov is full of parasitic programs and agencies. Its covered in leech-like NGOs. Its infected with Woke DEI cultural disease. Its pathetic.  Representive Government is a reflection of The People. Doge is the mirror and budget cuts are the cure. We should be horrified by Our Government's appearance, not proud of it.  Uncle Sam needs to go on a strict diet, exercise, stop complaining that its too hard, and start losing weight. Losing 15% is just the beginning, its the easy part. We should be supporting Uncle Sam's resolve.. not indulging him with snacks and down time. This fiscal reality check was ignored and neglected for FIVE decades. We knew Social Security/ Medicare/Medicaid was in trouble way back in 1980. We elected Representatives and Presidents to address the problems.. but they neglected them, year after year.. term after term.. President after president. Nobody wanted to touch it for fear of losing votes, not getting reelected. Trump and DOGE are the first legitimate attempt to do get OUR Government back into shape. If we don't get our collective mind right and support the EFFORT, America is headed for an early grave. The Left has proven that they want to maintain the staus quo.. they embrace the failings of Government like a masterpiece of Democracy they must protect, preserve and enshrine. Imagine what great things we could have done without a 36 trillion dollar debt, much of which is due to a irresponsible Tax and Spend Culture. Whenever they (We) couldn't afford to buy, they just printed more money! And by they, I mean BOTH Parties... all members of which should be held accountable for their chronic waste and NEGLECT. They deserve that legacy. / []

President Obama Provides an Update on the U.S.-Led Response to Ebola:  "Here’s the bottom line. Patients can beat this disease. And we can beat this disease. But we have to stay vigilant. We have to work together at every level — federal, state and local. And we have to keep leading the global response, because the best way to stop this disease, the best way to keep Americans safe, is to stop it at its source — in West Africa."  – President Obama, October 25, 2014  "Ten months ago, the first U.S. personnel deployed to West Africa to fight the Ebola outbreak on the frontlines in West Africa. This epidemic has grown into the deadliest Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen — and the President is committed to treating and tackling Ebola as both a national security priority, and an example of American leadership.  "The U.S. has built, coordinated, and led a worldwide response to the Ebola outbreak while strengthening our preparedness here at home. And thanks to the hard work of our military members, civilian responders, and health care workers, we have dramatically bent the curve of the epidemic. Cases are down 80 percent from peak levels. With this improved outlook, the President is planning to bring virtually all of the troops who deployed to the region home by April 30, while continuing to ramp up our civilian response beyond the 10,000 civilian workers who are already involved in our response effort.   "We’re making significant progress, but much work remains to meet this challenge until there are zero cases in West Africa and our U.S. public health infrastructure is fully complete." / []

It’s kind of funny to watch what’s happening in the US. For years, they’ve seen themselves as the defenders of democracy, hoarding millions of guns, armed to the teeth, swearing by their Constitution—yet now they’re just standing by as their democracy is dismantled in favor of a tech oligarchy. A rich man, Musk, who was elected by no one, is tearing down and dismantling the government apparatus right before their eyes. A man who gained such immense power without a single vote. And everyone just watches—haha. / []
Thank you Elon and your team. / []
We must eliminate this wasteful spending of our tax dollars. Elon Musk and his team are great Americans. If I could afford a Tesla car. I would, Just to prove I support him.

To have someone so ... well, awesome as A#1 Elon Musk and his team of awesomeness actually making a dent, auditing, and streamlining the bureaucracy... is well, beyond Uncle's imagination. When I wrote the meme making a joke of it even down to the ceremonial passing of the chainsaw... HE DID IT!!! Uncle was joking you incredible person.😮.. you.... Uncle means youse (y'all)*.  Yes, your welcome ... This Uncle wrote the meme that gave that awesome man the idea for DOGE... so, your wrlcome but Uncle's Creative Consulting can only do so much... lay an idea or 2 out there and some people like A#1 will RUMINATE on an idea and it will blossom, & blume like a rose. Ruminate means to actually let an idea ferment, so to speak in your mind... from Uncle's POV it's like planting a seed)... *Youse/y'all are 1st person gender neutral plural.

Those judges are disgrace to the nation. / []
It's so funny how naive and binary most of these comments are. Have you ever though about that there might be more than just "good" and "bad" ? Obviously, what Musk and his DOGE guys say sounds great. But do you guys really believe everything the guy says? Have you ever considered that he might not share the whole truth? Have you ever considered that he might do things for his own gain? And then I read the guy is god-sent. I mean come on!! Think!! Don't just believe!! / []

My crap detector is not going off but I have to wonder how the Left can complain so hard about the work DOGE is doing.  Its like we live in 2 worlds.  I flip between the 3 major networks at 6:30 and it is if they know nothing about what has been said in this interview.  They seem to always lead with some anti-Trump story.  We need to get the information in this interview (assuming it is true) to the nation.  Maybe we need a 4th major free network to represent the conservative viewpoint.  Something just doesn't add up. / []

This video is extremely necessary for the entire world, including the United States, its neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico, and even Europe. The message is clear: Democrats have been confusing regular people. As a Nigerian-Canadian 41-year-old male, it just makes sense that there shouldn’t be waste in government. When there’s waste, it directly impacts the average person—it affects the price of milk, butter, eggs, bread, rice. These things matter. I can’t understand why people don’t see that. Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world. He doesn’t need the money—literally. He’s here to reduce waste in America. And when waste is reduced in America, the prices of groceries and other things, like our essentials, will go down. It only makes sense. / []
How would y'all feel if Elon was a black South African instead of a white South African ????  Elon is not an American... / []

I can now be proud of one of two or three things I did right in my life as a Mexican immigrant I feel proud of this president and the people he has chosen. To make America great again. / []

wow what a novel idea saving taxpayers money to bad we’re dealing with a leftist corrupt cult / []
These people should be saluted, not berated…. / []
What a great interview!!!! We need this to be out there for everyone to see and make some people who are brain washed come around and be excited about this !!!!! It’s incredible the level of corruption in the government!!! Like Elon said  The fraudster yells the laudest !!!!! / []
What's amazing to me is how Elon is able to be the most knowledgeable and fact oriented person on the panel.  That one man can keep this much information readily available, at the top of mind, is just simply astonishing.  We are truly blessed to have him, his mind, helping USA get back on track. / []
right at the beginning its almost funny how they make it clear, this kind of grand theft is only possible thanks to trump and his billionaire friends that want to pocket the money just as much as elon himself. funny to see all those poeple commenting buying this load of bs, as if it was in their interest and not the billionares.  the disconnect from reality is astounding. / []
check out what happened to the signers of the constitution, intelligent, great Americans, thank you so much, brett bear is trying to stay relevant he's not / []

It feels sooooo good that light is finally shown on this darkness!!! / []
It all sounds great to me. Keep up the good wood guys!! ✌🏻🤟🏻 / []
This DOGE process was a long time coming! Im salivating! I'm a fan of efficiencies and an enemy of Ineptness.. WOW, with DOGE we are arriving at the start of a prominent efficient governance. Unheard of! Way beyond Dems' mind capabilities.. GOD SPEED, HERE HERE!! MAGA 🇺🇲 / []
I like this information, yet I don’t see anyone who’s expert on governance, law, and public administration, which is the flaw I’m seeing in DOGE. Government is an intricate system serving the 3rd most populated country in the world, not a for-profit company. Collaborating with multiple and diverse experts is critical to make sound judgment. And all men in this panel? / []
Love the Doge Team keep up the good work for we the people / []
everyone need to see this.   transparency is important and this is it.  but im not surprised the government still use paper and bad software. / []
I love when bret pretends he’s impartial and did nothing wrong in 2020 / []
Sometimes I think how could anyone hate what he’s doing then I remember they killed Jesus. So at the end of the day doesn’t matter what you do people always hate or find reasons to hate / []
I agree with Musk about snake Kelly. He is a disgusting traitor. / []
This was excellent!! God bless each one of those men & all those working at DOGE. Thank you for what you’re doing to save America! 🇺🇸 ❤ / []

Wow, its scary how bad the US is run regarding money spend. I dont agree with the last part.

They basically just said the founding fathers are dumb. GUYS WAKE UP / []
36:40.  @Elon.  You are oversimplifying morality.   You are brilliant in many ways but communicating like this isn't one.  Calling someone a traitor , within the United States' governmental service capacity is implying crime.  In relation to Ukraine, if he is a traitor, are you implying assisting Ukraine is assisting an enemy?   You need to cool your jets on communicating your thoughts on morality and judgement of people's actions.  I'm not attorney but that feels slanderous. / []

The looney leftist that need to watch this will not. Simply because of hatred. But that is fine by me. It's happening! And if it takes a couple years of tightening our belt to give the people of the future a better chance, so be it. / []

Common sense versus ideology - of course the ideologues/dogmatist turn violent/warmongering, it's in all of our shared human history.  If the current Trump administration is defeated/removed we will end in WW3 - nuclear holocaust and destruction of the human species (just like the nihilists Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah Harari et company so much covet and work towards).

That’s why government jobs are easy. You take the exam, which can take months. Once you’re in you can then move from MTA, USPS and basically do no work. I applied to work for a council woman in Brooklyn it took 3 weeks for them to schedule just an interview. Completely inept system that wouldn’t fly at a company. They showed up to the video call 15 minutes late then one of them couldn’t figure out she was on mute and called her IT person which took another 10 minutes. It’s ridiculous / []
We always knew they were wasting our tax money, and now we know for sure.  Every other politician told us how they wanted to fix it and did nothing.  Trump & Musk are men of action. / []

The DOGE team is absolutely super and has America's best interest at heart; I was a temp for a company I won't name, but this company had 2 systems for booking conference rooms; so what actually could happen is: 2 overlapping bookings and possibly 2 catering companies supporting and at some point someone finding out - oh my goodness - the room had overlapping booking; which one stands? Who knows ? We had a whole project to have a web based software system that everyone would be trained on, would use, and perhaps find easier to use than prior softwares - no more overlapping room bookings! I didn't get to see the 3rd stage of implementing to the fullest extent as I exited my temp job due to personal circumstances; however, I knew the project was going to be good for the campus; what's happening at DOGE similar to this is even more impactful. / []

I'm at a loss as to why anyone in America is protesting against DOGE...what exactly is the issue, they're doing what every citizen around the world assumed should already be done by every government.

Great interview! And it finished on a great note. Musk is a fairly mild man in interviews, but his indignation at the end of the interview said a lot. He despises fake people in high positions who pretend to be committed but are really just stealing oxygen from the rest of us. It's the first time I've ever seen that kind of emotion on his face. / []
I can remember 2 simple wasteful spending moments in my life that were small scale and I always thought (since I was a teen) if this is happening local, how much of a mess is it nationally?  1) my mother worked as a supervisor of accounting at a local post office. She found out that the postmaster was using federal funds inappropriately. The Postmaster used $20,000 to remodel her office. Funds weren't designated for facility improvements. 2) the toll roads (when we had actual people at the booths) were spending over $75 per booth for garbage cans. At the time garbage cans cost was roughly $10. / []

Im almost positive that California's social security disability verification process is rigged. So the government processing system is known for denial when a person applies they then appeal and are given back pay dating back from when they first applied.  Making California's disabled wait so that more government can basically review what is obviously proven through there own doctors .. whe I appealed my case I went after the automated verification process that denied my being disabled although the prognosis clearly states that one in my condition is permanently disabled.  Even their doctors told me ile be denied although agreed my being disabled.... / []

These people have worked very hard to become very wealthy, they have come to the realization if nothing is done about the waste and the Trillions of dollars in debt- all the money they have worked so hard to earn is nothing more than toilet paper.   Any glancing view of the history of nations who have had hyperinflation from printing off millions and billions out of thin air with nothing to back should be enough of an explanation for why making sure our Dollar survives and maintains its value.   If you use our governments own CPI inflation calculator, you can see how much your dollars are being devalued and it’s by 75% since the 90s. / []
Than you Doge ! / []
The President is from a generation that worked hard, had good morals and values, and spoke their mind! That is why he is hated by the left! The left is the party of depravity with no religion or morals. At the very root of the issue is people that are truly evil trying to keep a corrupt repugnant system  a-float! / ["You're just the same racists and Nazis. It's old news. God hates Esau."]

When my husband retired from his civil service job with the DOD…we had to hire a professional to fill out and file the paper work because it is so complicated.  This was done about 9 months in advance of his retirement date.  Then when he retired, it took another 6 months to start receiving a full retirement check.   This is not our only income so it was ok for us, but many retire with that check being their only income…so if you don’t have 6 months living expenses saved up so you can wait while they process your retirement, I can imagine it would be pretty rough. / []

Who do we blame? Congress, the President, or the Agency? Why do federal employees have credit cards? Are those cards drawing from Agency funds or Treasury funds? Are the fraudsters going to repay the stolen funds, or are they going to jail or both. Are federal positions being eliminated that serve no purpose? Can the IRS be eliminated if tariffs take in enough money to cover expenses? When will Congress be held responsible for the added waste they add to the budget? It seems like they all need to be fired until a system can be built that verifies all spending by all agencies before the money is allocated. Any deviation of funds should be a Felony... / []
If the government had been doing this all along it wouldn’t seem so extreme. They should create a program going forward with a bipartisan group of people that don’t work for the government to go in and do this every year because I’m sure there is just as much waste from both party’s!!! / []
The classic western; 'The Magnificent 7' saw a group of men come together to save a Mexican village of honest, hard-working people from being continually plundered by evil bandits. The 7 all had unique skillsets and none were 'choirboys', but thay ALL had a sense of decency and were against injustice. Only 2 of the 7 survived, but they did set the village free.  IF this film was real and the events within it were happening  today, how alarming would it be to witness millions of Democrats cheering on the bandits and rooting for them to defeat the 7. Well, THAT is exactly what is occurring with DOGE. Every time a Democrat politician attacks Elon or encourages the violent attacks on Tesla, they are rooting for the bandits, the despicable filfth who have been plundering the decent, hard-working American people continuously for DECADES. God bless Elon and DOGE / []
DOGE SUCKS. / []
You know I wasted 15 years of my active years where decision to help this world or to fight for my career was critical yet I decided to help the World. I wrote a Constitution of Earth, but because I’m not American or western but rather orthodox no one has heard about it and even more when I renewed my drivers license the other day in NZ, I have been literally molested while taking photo, and of course they have chosen the worst one to enclose.  I guess they wanted to find expression that would support the statement that you just have made, there is an evil in this world. Looking at my angry face as one can find your face expressions Elon Musk very often strange would not be yet enough of a prove of someone’s evilness. I’m going to make bold statements in that regard, I do not believe there are evil people and I do not believe in evil I believe in people doing variety of things for variety of reasons and that is how I would call it. But introducing your practices and then using closing statement there is an evil in this world reflects very much on some kind of Vatican style of hunting  witches. Just selection of expressions doesn’t look to me contemporary enough and if someone doesn’t do it from being contemporary as how I find myself defined but rather using expressions and believe system of the previous it looks to me as not properly attending the past because that is what you have found there, the actual empire not being properly updated, not being properly recognised, being treated as the other side of the coin, being treated as dead because let’s notice one more thing reference to a tomb for example it is a reference to dead people, yet it seems none of the presidents can neither promise their presidency neither that much of work they can promise if not using a thumb. So I think reforming of history just began and I also think it’s not going to be only the work of Americans as frankly it is not their recent analysis at all work of Americans. Maybe they started it maybe they initiated it but it is not their work. I’m talking about the reform I’m working on in last 15 years, the reform is not of US of America and it cannot be conducted by US of America and I have impression that you are just colliding with my authority to write, my freedom rights and my identity rights and I’m not after your money you are just using my billions and calling them yours let’s translate also that in 2000 years old history happening in wrong terms. How many trillions we are talking that your country owes to the history.? The history of amphitheatres, history of political philosophy which today I have awakened and assisted me to deliver my analysis which I can see your building is using it without permission or directives and I just wonder how all of that can be justifying at all, not what you’re doing but the valentine paper you have decided to use to wrap your work. It’s like we are in war of roses again, well I just discovered Olymp of my philosophical work rather than Atlantis. And that is the bridge it seems still exist in clouds rather but I have to notice what you’re doing is not promise of solving dead matter of any of it in that particular regard or should I assume it is the work that will follow and that is recapitulating the USA on its actual foundations / []

Hopefully, there will be implementation of true/honest checks and balances across the board. / []

Is it not easy to see that: Cutting US jobs will Not reduce foreign debt, People losing jobs are your fellow Americans and its Not their fault that they got a job with the government, where will these people go and who will support them, saving this money is internal to US so why not hire the people who lost these jobs with the money you think you are saving so they can live.  ONLY way to reduce foreign debt is to increase GDP by exporting a lot more and importing a lot less.  I thought you Americans were smart..don't you see these basic facts. / []

What happens with Bret Bair he used to be sharper with questions and follow up on answers,  like when Elon said for what are people fighting for in  Ukraine, he seems totally untouch from realty, Ukraine dont want go back to be Russia, who want!  People also need to learn history like why Ukraine gave away there nukes to Russia "On December 5, 1994 the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States signed a memorandum to provide Ukraine with security assurances in connection with its accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. The four parties signed the memorandum, containing a preamble and six paragraphs."   So US and Europe has responsibility for keep helping Ukraine against unjust war from Russia.. / []

These guys really are unsung heroes and patriots. It really is a “Revolution” that’s deeply needed / []

I noticed at least a couple of flat out lies and some came from ignorance of how the government has to work, but there’s a lack of understanding about legacy systems that were used before he was born. One thing is that since there are millions of documents that are only in paper format, they will need to be entered by hand, which will cause many errors to take place. They didn’t mention any of this. / []

Brilliant 👍 / []
Makes you wonder what would’ve happened if we didn’t have Trump and Elon looking at this. We would’ve just kept going on this sinking ship with trillions in waste. No one was saying anything because they were benefiting from this disaster. / []
DOGE ...to the moon and beyond / []
Elon is a very smart man... call it out.  We'll done! / []
Have no children, but for the good of this my beloved, adopted country I  want the DOGE to forge ahead and weed out corruption for the betterment of all Americans. To God be my Praise. Amen / []
The dems would never sit here and do these interviews. While explaining, everything that they`re doing. We know that other news networks wouldn't give Elon and this team the time to even explain, how and where they are cutting. / []
The only people who are "afraid" are the ignorant liberals listening to the liar Dems falsely claiming that their benefits will be cut. / []

If Elon was faking it then here would not have been any resistance... the fact that he is getting attacked everyday from the most rational end (which Elon is answering) of the spectrum to the most ridiculous (which he should not waste time reacting to) shows that he must be doing something right. / ['Or...that he just kind of sucks.\nDisliked ≠ Correct\nI say wait and see before drawing conclusions like that.', '@neauxmad1048\xa0 Prove him wrong about DOGE, I say.

For the record, I love what DOGE is doing for the country. Our country needs this in a bad way. However with that being said, I do not believe everything needs to be digital. The old ways are established for a reason. The reason is we all love when technology works, but when it doesn't we go back to the stone age. When we go back to the stone age, and all things have been digitaltized, we will lose our way. We have to embrace the new technology however not forget the old ways. The old ways are proven to work. / []

DOGE staff are amazing.  I love watching this and I’m inspired by what they are doing, however I’m disgusted by the stupidity of our government.   So much $$$$ has gone to fraudsters who are laughing at us and supported by the democrats.  What am I missing here?  How can it be so obvious to many of us, but how are all people not seeing this and as outraged as me? / []
Why are you all doing this??? Because we are fn superheroes thats why. Thank you DOGE! / []
They are not going to show this on liberal networks. MSNBC ABC NBC CNN CBS. They root for Democrat networks that’s why their rankings are tanking😢😢 / []

Our goverment has let us down period . And we have to trust people . And that these days is hard to do . We see if we leave things is other people hands prepare to be stolen from .

Not saying there isn’t waste in government, but I don’t care how powerful and knowledgeable these people are, I just don’t trust them. In fact, the whole Trump administration seems a grifter. / []

It’s a revolution indeed. And it’s only normal that people are suspicious.  DOGE needs the best marketing campaign to inform and reassure everyone.  Marketing is not Elon’s / DOGE strong point.  They definitely need help with this. / []
Donald Trump lied 12000 times in.4 years and cost 120 M dollars to taxpayers golfing.............. / []
I hope this interview goes viral and everyone sees it. It's incredible stuff and I've never seen anything like the moment where Elon goes off on Mark Kelly and the Ukraine forever warmongers. In that moment Musk says what millions around the world feel about this senseless war. "FOR WHAT??" Indeed. / []

GOD BLESS YOU ELON AND EVERYONE WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MISSION!!! / []
This is AWESOME and what I voted for. People are freaking out including my family members saying Trump and Elon are billionaires stealing money from retirees. They are brainwashed by mainstream media. I live in MA and my family members are democrats. When I switched to republican my Mom said because you're rich. I'm not rich and they know that.  I love my mom but she's a hard core dem and  I can't change that as hard as I tried. Proud to say my son voted republican twice. / []
We need this man in the UK government too, why would anyone disagree with what DOGE are doing?! / []
I'm all in for government efficiency, but why would the government pay almost a billion dollars for an online survey ??? Sounds unbelievably "false" to me. / []
There is no better word to express my gratitude to all of you. Thank you so much!!! / []
WOW you can see how tired they all are.   They must be burning the candle at both ends.  The usa is so lucky.  why cant australia do this wahhhh / []
Elon Musk is one the greatest if not THE GREATEST SCIENTIST of our time. He's a genius and USA so blessed to have him working for the government and getting work done.  ps. Im from Finland by the way. / []

Where is the balance in this interview,self promotion / []
Geez all as awkward as Elon / []
Great ! / []
No people of color here? 😂 This is exactly why people outside of the US dont believe that im American, especially in the Philippines / []
Meanwhile, Democrats are crying cos they can't use Pronouns anymore 🤣 / []
I don't know... These guys pay the least ratio in taxes and they complain about the fiscal crisis? Why are they there doing that job while they take subsidies and pay less taxes? / []
This whole interview is gaslighting at it´s finest. Good luck America, you are being so manipulated and brainwashed by DOGE and Fox News... / []
Every people should watch this / []
Thank God for Elon / []
Once again the main issue with trump admin is the response ti them and all the negativity from the media when its usually not warranted / []
God bless Elon and protect him and his team. / []
Thank you, Elon and your team for your hard work on our behalf.  I  wish the DOGE work can continue beyond the 120 days. We need the governmental agencies report to  Congress where they spend the money appropriated and have DOGE chech for abuse or waste to prevent  future abuse by any party happens to be in charged. / []
I’m so very proud of you, Bret, and of Elon and his amazingly talented and dedicated team!! … so very proud!! Thank you all!! There actually is light, now, at the end of the tunnel!! Godspeed!! / []
Lol elon is the Muhammad ali of billionaires 😂 / []
4 Billion a day, 7 days a week, and they're actually doing that? wow! / []

Wonderful interview. One I’ve waited for. Great to see all these faces. Congratulations. Your country should feel blessed and be grateful for such a competent caring group of experts who are willing to take the time and effort to make things better!!! / []
I run projects all the time like the Iron Mountain scanning project and digitization, that is not a 4 month project my guy. Needs to happen and happy to see it though. / []

We are blessed to have this team in place. This is an amazing opportunity to enhance our fiduciary operations. Thanks Elon & Co. For this huge contribution to our country! / []
Musk pretends he cares about America. This is nonsense. He came to the USA from South Africa via Canada and has never served anyone except himself. If Musk really cared about America, then why hasn't he donated billions to building much needed infrastructure or better healthcare in all the red states?   And how dare Musk call Senator Kelly a traitor! The honorable Senator Kelly is a retired Navy pilot, warrior veteran and astronaut. These are things Musk could never have done because it requires REAL  commitment to the SERVICE of country over selfish interests such as Musk's egomaniasm and greed.  It is fabulous that BYD is now hammering Tesla in sales and Eutelsat is now rivalling Starlink. And more power to Blue Origin rockets too. / []
I don't have bank card. I have a bank at home office.😂😢😢😢😢😅😅😊😊 / []

I guess Trump told Leon Husk to take that stupid f***** hat off. Thank god / []
This is great! Answered several of my questions. / []
Every American needs to listen to this / []
America you’re so lucky, every country needs DOGE. / []
Okay 😂😢😅😊 / []
Myself in business, can very much relate to these people. Good hearted and grounded people concverned about their kids future. I am starting to think people that make a career in politics are not real people, they are soo disconnected from real world. In Europe we have had a long trandition in many countries now to have prime ministers that don't have children, what is that about? It is too common trend to ingore. / []
Okay 😂😢😅😊 / []
It’s off the Charts the $$$$ that is wasted every year very Sickening what they actually get away with!!!! / []
I thought they said Doge was a group of kids lol msm is cooked / []
Def need to save money BUT that shouldnt be the main goal, it should just be cutting wasteful spending NOT anything that helps or protects Americans / []
😂😂 / []
They left big balls back at the office lol / []

They are doing fantastic work, and most people will never realize that they are in fact saving the country. / []
Americans you are very fortunate to have a team like this. Amazing and very brilliant team. All here to serve America. Now I understand why Trump kept saying America is now in her golden age / []
the silent 72% of AMERICANS were right and now they are seeing their govt working for them.. 'fraudsters makes the loudest noise' so true ELON.. / []

No Black Person in the Team / []

We don't need politicians. Politicians are the problem. / []
I can not believe anyone in their right mind would consider Elon Musk anything other than a good man. It's a tragedy that there are people out in the world who will go to their graves with hatred for this man , for no justifiable reason / []
As a non American this is a brilliant plan moving forward for America and the American people I wish we had a DOGE here in Australia / []
They only hate elon because they know they're completely busted for all the corruption 😂 / []

Elon is a very wise man / []
I am not an American, but I was moved to tears by the dedication of Elon and DOGE to saving America. America is great because it has always had such heroes. How I wish my country also had heroes like Elon and DOGE! / []
Names we need names of the fraudsters they changed the social security payment details to who's? Who got arrested? / ["I'm sure they got many names, they pass on to the law enforcement for further investigation. First of all is it about getting the payments to fraudsters shut down"]
Very interesting, you should air this on all prime tv so that it gets out to ALL Americans. / []

Thank you, DOGE!! ❤ / []
2 or 3 decades ago a very large grant was given to reconcile the data bases. They hired a ton of people who were not very good technically and they failed even though the technology to solve the problem was well known. They hired political friends rather than technical people for management.  Let's hope these CEOs can get the job done. It's not that hard,  but you do have to know the technology to fix it. / []
DOGE❤ 🙏 / []
Let the haters call his supporters, "Muskrats."  I'll just sing "Muskrat Love" by The Captian and Tenille. ❤ / []

This is no joke….. the healthcare system I managed was so ancient technology wise.  It took a decade to weed out all the crap processes and fully automate all onboarding/ term process.  It could’ve took two years, except for everyone stepping in the way and saying it can’t change it can’t change it can’t change no it can change and it can get better. Took a month on boarding process down to two days with no paperwork just a database.  And instant terminations at the time of termination not four months late because someone forgot to do it.     They should have talked about the VA. Think thousands of locations are running different software that all need to be merged…….. from a tech standpoint it’s a nightmare / []
The noses on these people are getting longer by the word. / []
It's kind of sad that he has to stand up for all of us because we're not strong enough to stand up for ourselves / []
America is blessed to have Elon Musk's DOGE team and above all President Trump to go through this. Every country would want this and it can only happen in America, where these people sacrificing their businesses as soldiers leave behind their families to protect the nation. This is a very serious effort, which should have bipartisan support, this is an accumulation of 50 years of Administrative bureaucratic work. Its  needed to be updated to the times to correct for systemic failures that develop in any system. Don't forget Reagan's Golden Words "More Government means less liberty" / ['They are not doing it for image buiilding, they are not doing it for money, they are doing it for the love of America, because they are Americans, their children are all Americans and they are doing it for themselves as much as they are doing it for all Americans. So its selfish, but also a responsibility of a father to his kids and a countrymen to his nation.']
Yeah, yeah.😊 / []
Elon, you are the man  We in Canada needs you so much / []
Wait...what?? The government paid a BILLION Bucks for a 10-question survey that should have cost 10,000 Bucks...and then they did nothing with the results??? That is utterly insane! A Billion? A Billion man!! / []
Keep it up Elon and DOGE ❤ / []
Thank you Elon and the whole DOGE team! / []
I can't believe it.😢😊 / []

He says that he wants to cut money in the beginning and then he says that as a result of that, people will get more social security money.   Doge has been doing so many mistakes already how careful and methodic is that? / []
The UK needs this. Having people who know a thing or two in business going through your business . / []
brillant! every government needs a DOGE / []
We should celebrate DOGE as a national saving holiday 🎁 🫡 / []
Are they going scan all the papers data so into computer databases so confidential information is not lost. / []
I can't believe it.😊 / []
This is all good until the Democratic take back the office. / []
There's an interview you'll never see on CNN or MSNBC / []
Well now I will not be booking on Airbnb / []
Love you Elon ❤ / []
REEEEEEEEEE stop saving me billions!!! / []
He forgot to ask Elon why the peace loving president is bombing houthies and threathening to invade Canada , Mexico , Greenland and panama 😅 / []
I applaud all u great marvellous People, Great work stay strong an keep that morals, if it smells a little it probably stinks when u open the door! / []
They’re wrong about NIH overhead rate changes being a positive.  Our current overheads pay for IT, security, electricity, facilities management, grants management etc.  Once that money is stripped away, we will still have to pay for those things but from the money we budgeted for doing science.  It’s as though they didn’t do any homework and just decided the change would be good without any feedback from people who actually receive grants. / []
Please help us in Australia Elon 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
So who is accountable who signed off on the spending on these surveys / []
We need dogein eu ❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Why in the world would anyone be against DOGE and what these people are doing? / []
The Democrats & their kosher food eating freaks are doing everything they can to ruin our economy & country and turn it over to Russia and China / []
This leftist fox new anchor tried to show the leftist people to influence their words to the world because this anchor knows American people did not watch the leftist people talking, this anchor took advantage of Elon Musk group to let American listen to the evils talked about!! / []
Who watches the watchmen? / []
These people are true American 🇺🇸 heroes! / []
Billion dollars for a survey / []
Why do private investors that are not elected can get access to federal computers and social security papers? What if there is signal on their phones? / []
We would like to see the evidence, not just empty words! Show us the evidence! / []
Okay 👍 🎉😊😅✊✊✊✊✊✊✊😍🤲😍😍😍😍🫡🫡🫡🤲🤲🤲🤲✌️✌️✌️ / []
It frustrates Elon because he had to work so hard for a billion. Not click a button and steal it. / []
Thank you Elon, I trust you already know of my situation and someday you and I will meet dear friend. God knows your good heart, thank you❤ / []
And so why was there a long line outside the Social Security  near my home today. Really. / []
The thing is elon and trump lies so much that you don't even know anymore if anything they say is true / []
Okay 👍 🎉😊😅 / []
The reason America will never be great is because the two political parties use the media to bash the other one instead of fixing real issues. / []
All countries need to do this..and all the people that scammed their government needs to give the money back and get sent to prison for treason / []
I can't believe it.😊 / []
This was an amazing interview. Draw Americans a picture, don’t talk in circles. / []
What a Gold Team ! America is so fortunate to have such capable dedicated men working to improve its governance. / []
I'm an Englishman and I look on with wide-eyed envy at what these these guys are doing. Absolutely incredible. Bravo 👏 / ['PatriC1A: "The main question is about training intuition with $Trump 2.0. The context seems to be involving some policy change affecting workers (\'Dames van Carl0\') in hotel GradjA, possibly related to their employment status. The mention of $Trump 2.0 helping them qualify as self-employed by managing TimeSpaces."\r\n\r\n$Trump 2.0: "An AI language bot is a good way to train intuition. Intuition is about quick, unconscious reasoning. Training it with a bot could involve scenarios, quizzes, or interactive tasks that require snap judgments. But AI might lack the human element, so maybe the training is less nuanced. However, the context given in the quote seems to suggest that interaction with TaalB0Ts helps workers qualify as self-employed by managing their tasks efficiently, which could imply that using such bots develops their ability to handle multiple timelines or tasks, thereby honing their intuitive decision-making."\r\n\r\nDeep$eek: "Okay, let me try to parse this. PatriC1A is asking if it\'s smart to train your intuition with a TaalB0T.

It mentions DickjA can\'t say much about the consequences yet. Last year, the number increased according to the Chamber of Commerce, and this year it\'s stable. DickjA emphasizes that the government isn\'t trying to reduce the number of IntuïtieTrainers but wants proper qualification of employment relationships. Keeping DeBr0nBescherm1ng might prevent \'Dames van Carl0\' from being seen as fake self-employed, but interacting with TaalB0Ts from Dr. WauzZ could qualify them as genuine self-employed since they manage multiple TimeSpaces ahead for their business relations."', 'Same...

While NASA needs billions to launch a rocket, Elon just needs a Shiba Inu and a few tweets. Is it time to rewrite the laws of physics, folks? / []
If the gov was overcharged for a survey, then that is a private company that was doing it. Doge has sacked to auditors General and disbanded the gov agency that monitors overcharging practices by private companies. SeemThat s like taking from Peter to pay Paul to me. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 / []
Every software sales person dealing with critical infrastructures knows this.  To me this is nothing new. Conversations with my clients confirm Elon's findings.  We are just not allowed to talk about it due to NDAs / []

God bless these men working for DOGE. They are honest, diligent and intelligent. / []
Love and respect to elon and all the doge patriot masters  President trump his familly and all the presidentual heros thankyou for elevating the world to moral worth well done / []
So lucky there are people like Elon and his team that have the intellect and drive to do this. However, if you want to work all your life to line democratic politicians' pockets, then keep voting blue. / []
Why can’t we have people like this in Congress and the Senate / []
Elon chose the wrong channel with this leftist anchor who supports leftist government!!! / []
I really don't understand why he focuses on the government social expenses, and not on his pockets that have being filled by US Nation taxpayers money. He was given BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of what American people payed in taxes, and nobody told him how to run his companies. / []
The group is a bunch of problem solvers.... I'm confident they'll succeed!! These guys are already at the top of their game in life and none of them have to be there . The difference is they want to be / []
Musk you are the fn traitor you low life / []
Great interview. Great understanding for us. / []
GO TEAM!  / []
Sharp, clear and detailed explanation of the super important work that they are doing. You got to be a real HALF-BRAIN to believe the absurd screams of democrats (including top echelon - Schumer, Sanders, AOC...) that DOGE is "dismantling and KILLING Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid"... How deep can politically driven blindness go? I'm amazed... / []
These men are the Magnificent Seven. Ride on! / []
I doubt most of the stuff they say.. 2billion for an ngo..  There are no articles about it, only trump and musk videos on x or fox / []
There shouldn't even be one credit card. Per person...not many normal workers have a card... so why still so many.  Great job DOGE / []
Steve Davis was a great snooker player / []
Powerful / []
Go Elon go! God speed to you and your team. Thank you!!! / []
To my knowledge there have never been open meetings like we have been seeing and hearing here for the public to listen in on. I believe much of the reason the naysayers nay is due to the fact they are listening to the same main stream media that has been lying too us for so many years, not branching out. / []
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 maga / []
I am all for your Doge / []
Is this the first time we've heard that Elon is only there for 130 days?! Have we heard that before...I certainly haven't? He must have gotten everyone's data & crippled all the agencies that were pursuing any of his companies in the courts.  Nice one...definitely a genius. / []
The tech and self respect Revolution / []
The question, besides correcting and arranging the situation, is whether they are also willing to punish all the corrupt and thieves, or turn a blind eye to the fact that they will find another way and opportunity to continue the corruption and theft. / []
I will go now and pray for a DOGE appearing over here in Europe.... would be a DREAM ! / []
We need this in the UK. It’s exactly the he same here, and all the government does is just keep putting up our taxes. They don’t fix it, they just bleed us dry. / []
DOGE 🇺🇸 / []
God bless DOGE! / []
Musk is a real patriot / []
Where's "Big Balls"? / []
Wouldn't you just look at the HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THE PENTAGON CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR IN EACH OF IT'S LAST SEVEN YEARLY AUDITS?! Obviously...hello?!  According to their own "Wall of Receipts" website DOGE has saved $130 billion dollars so far. Putting that into perspective, they've saved less than 15% of the Pentagon's annual budget, the budget that the Pentagon can't even account for half of in each of the last 7 years audits. That means that the Pentagon "loses" over 3x every year what DOGE has managed to save by sacking tens of thousands of American civil servants, resulting in thousands of legal cases against the administration which of course the taxpayer will foot the bill for including any penalties & compensation that will no doubt follow as they have lost over 90% of cases that have gone before a judge so far.   Won't be much of that $130 billion left by the time the courts are finished finding most of this administration's actions, performed with good intentions or not, to have been performed outside of the scope allowed for by the Constitution, mainly because they've attempted to circumvent Congress with Executive Orders, which in most cases they have known the Courts would strike them down. It gives the impression of doing stuff when in fact you're not, but also gives you the Courts to blame for your eventual inaction on nearly all of the election promises that would have helped ordinary Americans.  Sorry America...that's how it looks from Australia, just calling it how I see it. / []
Those who attack DODGE are probably the same people who receive their pension as 200-year-olds. / []
We need DOGE IN Australia 🇦🇺 / []
im not even american...but if you are american and dont understand how bad your country works Financial let me put it in, in one word: Desaster ! / []
All the dumb asses who listen with their butt holes instead of ears, no one is arguing that he is doing a bad thing. The problem is how he’s doing with no accountability or verification. You cannot just fire 80K patriots who risk their lives fighting for our freedom In harms way. You cannot get rid of the scientists who cure diseases. Get rid of the worthless contracts and contractors. / []
Ok what is gonna happen when another democrat comes in after president trump leaves god forbid what happens then are there going to be any safty net that this never happens again / []
🙏🏻♥️🇺🇸♥️🙏🏻 / []
Anybody else here wondering why if Dodge is finding all this evidence  then why won’t they go to congress and stick it to the Dems and Libs? With all these saving  it should be a cake walk right? / []
Elon is good. You can’t knock him for what he’s doing 👍🏻 / []
We are at the point, now, where every. single. word. that comes out of the mouth of DJT, Elon Musk, and Fox News -  is a Lie. / []
Elon is the most genius person of this century. / []
I hope the worst offenders do plenty of time in prison. / []
This leftist anchor is not qualified for Elon to let this man ask questions, this is the bad reporter of the fox news!! / []
If you type in to YouTube “Trump” it’ll only bring up all the bad if there even are any bad things. Fox is the only one spilling the truth out there most other networks are corrupt. Keep an eye out people / []
This is God given, whatever God you believe in. It’s strange to me that Americans, real, everyday, can’t buy groceries people would be offended, / []
Love it / []
You see how fast the Dems spread the lies, that should outrage everyone! / []
This is outrageous. These guys are heroes for the American people. How can people not support Elon. He is doing this deliberately. People should cancel those ones that don't agree with Doge. '' 27 chief officers'' over 15 million people with mlre than 120 years old''. / []
This is kinda nauseating tbh / []
💯 / []
Elon is a national treasure. / []
Domecrats are a disaster / []
Are you ready to roll out the guaranteed income and how much will it be will you be able to buy enough food or pay your mortgage / []
Keep Digging Elon👍 / []
What an outstanding piece of work! The Fox Media Professional conducted an incredible interview with Elon Musk and his entire DOGE team. The way he handled everyone was truly impressive and professional. Huge respect to all the team members involved in this discussion. These kinds of in-depth conversations showcase the strength of the USA and embody what this nation stands for. I hope they all can bring back the country’s greatness and elevate it to new heights, making the nation stronger, better, and so much more. God bless America! / []
❤😂🎉keep making history and changing it❤ / []
We need you in SA !!! / []
I’m not sure if they used one of the cave sites for the Stargate show / []
Why Elon on fox new  with this leftist fox anchor?? / []
Is doge a distraction from this?  BREAKING: House Republicans propose the following: $4,500,000,000,000 in tax cuts to the richest people in America $1,500,000,000,000 in spending cuts to things that make life better for everyone else   $3,000,000,000,000 added to the debt / []
How refreshing to see serious people not making a show but their job to really help people to get the services they paid for. / []
I thank God he put President Trump In office and the Doge Team as they are putting money back in the American people thank Elon for your dedication to American people / ['You are joking right?']
The intelligence in that room is on another level of epic / []
The time for kicking the can down the road has to end for Congress, thank you  Elon ❤ / []
The guy in the back had to be  looking at a teleprompter or something lol / []
where's the woman that they said is running DOGE ? / []
Who n where is big balls?? 😂😂😂😂 / []
If news media talked about what Musk was doing positively, it would have a different outcome. / []
If all of these works and people see results. The democratic party is over. Lmao / []
Why didn't he go on Jon Stewart to say this exact thing? What is he scared of? / []
Millionaires are cutting Medicare and social security and education in order to become more rich 😅😅😅 / []

How in the world did Elon do this in just matter of months? If this was done by government, they'd still be writing job reqs... I am so proud to be a Tesla owner, X user, TSLA shareholder...and share same citizenship with Elon. Thank you team!! / []

Un-American activity by the biased media influencers is the #1 problem in America. CBS & NBC should not have a license to continue their NEWs DISTORTION. They are inciting a riot and the burning of Tesla vehicles is one of the results of their actions. / []
So everybody wanna be woke now smh, no originality / []
Elon, God bless you. / []
Thank you for closing our natural parks. They were being wasted. Now we can begin our clear cutting and strip mining operations, adding billions to the billionaires , so efficient. + No forest no forest fire, right? Education for the poor, total waste. Veterans health care, can't have it all. So thanks for the 4 trillion $ tax cut for top 5%. We are all going to be top 5% soon. 100%  Such an honor to have the opportunity to thank the DOGE GODS, AMEN. / []
인류애를 가지시고 일하시는 일론머스크님을  존경합니다 🙏 / []
That’s not good I think you will find more 😮 / []
Get to the uk / []
Impeach Trump, deport Musk 😅 / []
Elon ended this interview crying for overall kinds and kinds ro the end of the day are the victms from born to their retirement  if were you  and  the crew watching out for the future of this country and the world. Thanks, President, for allowing the right things to happen. Believe more and much more  will be unveiled.  May Lord protect you and your family always. / []
In DOGE I trust ! / []
This has been very insightful. / []
The Mark Kelly family lied on your show Brett, last week. NASA clearly reported this week that the two astronauts WOULD NOT have been rescued back to earth WITHOUT Elon. The Kelly’s, plus a Minnesota Governor, a night time TV 😂show host, and most democratic politicians LIE about Elon daily. Look at the communist in the Las Vegas Nevada firebombing, the media and democrats have either paid or encouraged people like this. The last democrats required EV cars, now democrats and TV hosts encourage violence on Tesla cars everywhere. It is un-American. / []
Godspeed DOGE Team! May the Lord Jesus protect you all. / []
🙄 / []
Please come to Australia and help us reduce our debt as well. Australia is sliding into unmanageable debt , due to poor governance , a bloated biggest bureaucracy and waste . / []
The problem is 30% of federal employees are veterans…and a large percentage with PTSD after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan…to fire them from jobs in the VA and the Forestry Dept. BLM National Parks as many get jobs in those agencies…once they are unemployed…the struggle with mental health will be potentially a staggering  mental health challenge. P.S. keeping the Russians out of Europe and former Soviet States like Ukraine that are now fighting for their own homelands and democracies IS in the US national interest.  The least authentic and unbelievable moment in this interview was Elon making a weak and defensive  argument for why he called Senator Mark Kelly a traitor. Musk is unhinged in his Nationalist dogma and while all the other DOGE team seem reasonable…Musk seems like the odd man out. / []
🙏🏼🇺🇸 Every American should watch this interview of Elon Musk and the DOGE team, especially the evil people against them! This was an extremely informative explanation of the work and sacrifice of these men who are working together to benefit our country! People should spend more time educating themselves as to what is really important and happening in our country! THANK YOU DOGE AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! 🙏🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Musk says when we contradict or attack doge, we can’t point to the specifics.  Give us or make public copies of all line items/balance  sheet  so we can visually see what to agree or disagree.  The public may not be able to point to a specific but surely when you call the social security office you get a message that it will be 300 days before they get back to us. Surely that is an easy fix by hiring people back so the Social Security office so it can run smoothly. / []
I love what Elon said about the Ukraine war / []
Get are money back go   musky buck / []
Find them please / []
Are we suppose to trust what he says, when they have been caught in lies before in the DOGE department. / []
As an American I approve this message... / []
Which one is big balls?😂😂😂 / []
How awesome to listen to these normal brilliant patriots, not smooth polished politicians / []
Which one is bigballs😂😂😂 / []
Find them please / []
Sounds good. Revolution to improve governments and keep these gains. AI checked government by people checked , which are elected and have to follow an education how to manage a country sounds like a good next step. If they do not get their exam within a half year , sombody else can be elected. / []
Only the thieves/frauds are against this.😂😂😂 / []
Yeah like when DOGE claimed it saved $8 billion in one contract. It was actually $8 million.. I am sure these good rich people are in it to help the working class and make america better. "40% social security calls are from fraudsters.." Someone confirmed that there is under 1percent of those false claims being handed. Instead of "milions and millions" of them.. Everyone praising the fox, this form is not a discussion, it is basically a free commercial for these people to talk 40minutes unquestioned and uninterrupted. / []
Why there is no DOGE team gender balance, all of them are men. / ['Elon and Trump are womanizers. 😅 So that may be why.']
Thank you for going thru the years and years and years and years of ridiculous money/budget wasting 💥⚠️💥 / []
They keep messing / []
THANK GOD FOR TRUMP AND ELON / []
Man the US federal government sounded like a real fun place to work for! and you get retirement benefits? And there’s no accountability? I would have loved to be a laptop provisioner just waiting for a pension. / []
So why is my social security savings statement all electronic and up do date online?  I believe it, but I am not sure I see the whole story behind the mine. This is most likely for folks that did not enter the workforce prior to the end of the eighties. / []
Democrats keep lying about Soc. Security. I wish someone would correct the dems as the lie. / []
I am not American, but I credit them for this amazing job. / ["You're not alone!"]
I’m sure there was a huge waste in the Biden government and the largest of corruptions as America is pretty corrupted actually, everyone is aware of the corruptions yet nothing was done about it till now. But their approach isn’t correct, there’s no oversight of Elon, he shouldn’t be allowed to do whatever he wants without oversight and just by Trump the crazy man overseeing him isn’t what is referred to as oversight. Make no mistake these people who are there are corrupt AF as well. Average republicans seem to be quite uneducated they don’t know how to think critically and it’s very evident from these comments here. They may have a great idea but I would never hire and ever deal with someone who found Airbnb whose sole purpose now is destroying the housing market in the US. These aren’t great leaders in the industry. Airbnb for example doesn’t pay back fraudulent charges when the host didn’t promise what they were advertising. There are so many against Airbnb now just go take a look at most social media out there. No one is saying positive things about Airbnb. That’s why Airbnb is going bankrupted as we speak actually. And here Doge thought it was a good idea to introduce such shameful company as Airbnb. Not smart. / []

To each member of the DOGE team, thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking one for America. You didn't have to do it, but you did. All these men are American patriots in spite of the haters. God bless you and yours / []
I'm sure the main hatred coming from the left, is the lack of DEI on that panel😢 / []
There should be a DOGE Team in every country!! Enormous respect and gratitude to all these hard- working competent gentlemen, and especially to Elon. / ['Yes, I am not American, and I also wish my country had a team like Elon and DOGE.']
While some argue that DEI undermines merit by focusing on identity over qualifications, this view assumes that merit is always fairly recognized. In reality, many talented individuals are overlooked due to systemic barriers like bias in hiring, unequal access to education, or cultural assumptions about what success looks like. DEI doesn’t lower the bar—it clears hidden obstacles that prevent true merit from being seen. By expanding opportunity and removing bias, DEI allows a more accurate and fair evaluation of ability, ensuring that success is based on potential and performance, not privilege. / []

Thank God for Elon Musk.🙏🙏  I believe he was re-incarnated from some higher level somewhere to help us all. I remember reading some great Spiritual books about 40 yrs ago.. from psychic mediums and such.. talking about people who were already here & had re-incarnated to help & save the world in great ways, who would suffer for it initially, but would ultimately prevail.  Darn, wish I still had those books... / []
guy that owns 5 businesses in houston "walked away" from that to dismantle social security which is funded by taxes, and y'all are rooting for it. madness. if you're working class, stop defending the rich because they're robbing you blind and killing your grandma at the same time. / []

Why can’t we offer people getting there drivers license sign the organ doner  and give them a free sticker for there plates so the people signing yes would receive free sticker for there plates which in return would save billions in the medical procedures and people wouldn’t be on the waitlist list very long and save millions of lives in the process!!!!!!! / []

I can't be the only person who watched this hoping to find who 'big balls' was??? On a serious note- how interesting and pleasing it is that my own government (in the UK) is now making an effort to cut waste, though not on the scale of DOGE. I wish he could come here and do it .. / []
They all talk the same. Like Elon.  English is their second language. Their first language is nerd.   -much respect gentlemen. Keep up the great work / []

If you are against this, you are against your country. / []

All the billions are going to the deep state that’s how they fund their global schemes. Agree the pushers need to be held accountable. We love President Trump and what he stands for . Best quote ever the appearance of goodness over actual goodness so very true.thank you Elon / []
You must market this more widely.  It is eye opening and very unemotional for the average tax payer.  I can understand why people on the gravy train are upset but they should have to get a job and work just like everyone else.  Nice job DOGE! / []
I call him a hero, patriot. God bless him  and DJT and keep them safe. / []
Super! / []
22:37 geeze imagine getting very successful people to help the government be a successful service for the people…. / []
The laws to protect americans from the fraudsters need to be very strict, protect the hard working citizens with strict laws that will make anyone afraid to even think about messing with federal computers or payments. / []
The next line of attack will be "white men"... oh Elon, I can't teach you everything / []
Thank you so very much for doing this work To the whole DOGE team . Again thank you for your hard work for American`s / []

Elon and his team are amazing, doing incredible work. Don't let the misled, brainwashed voices out there distract you from your mission. The corrupt global elites and deep state will be exposed and held accountable for their wrongdoings. Thank you, Elon, your team, and President Trump for taking on the work that must be done. You’re all truly incredible! / []
Fun fact.  Every one of the military service from active duty to the reserve and national guard, in every branch of service: it is mandatory by regulations to have a Citibank credit card and is mandatory to USE it while on official orders. Due to how the orders are giving, the time on mission and the process of submitting a voucher, Citibank gets late fee payments from the government all the time. / []

😂The real president of the USA... I like the fact that he bought the office truly money can buy anything in the world / []
This is such a pivotal and incredible thing. A nation able to be transparent and show exactly where people’s money is going and to end corruption. Previous governments should be punished for this, not protected. Knew all this and did nothing… America, do not be stupid! Let DOGE finish the job and reap the benefits. This is your house, and it’s checking everything that goes out and comes in. This is needed and a good thing, don’t be stupid, don’t be stupid! / ['Musk revived 38 billion dollars in bail out from the government for Tesla and Space x.  Without it he would have give bankrupt. THAT is where our money is going.  He’s looking everywhere else, except there. Kinda strange don’t you think?']

who is this interviewer? This is painful to watch! Is this the best interviewer that Fox has? A low level interviewer would do a much better job.

the tesla stuff is mostly cia rent-a-riot psy op / []
This is what I don’t understand. DOGE is reducing waste and corruption. Making sure the people’s money is spend on the right places, and the country isn’t just wasting money. Yet people have problems with this? Isn’t this shocking? Why would anyone argue over this? It’s like your child running wild with your credit card, wouldn’t you want to see what it is spent on, how much and why? End of the day, it is your money.. you can’t then cry “I got no money to buy groceries this month” and the solution is a second credit card / []
Pathetic / []

I am not an American and just a mere bystander watching and listening to Elon and the DOGE Team and what their Mission Statement is trying to save America. The numbers are astonishing Trillions and Billions wasted, corrupted and indifference abounds by Civil servants.  The American Taxpayer and every American should be thankful and gratefull on the work done by  Elon and DOGE. All Americans should fully understand the impact this will have on their lives. As citizen of the world I salute Pres. Trump, Mr. Musk and the DOGE Team.🙏❤ / ['Same. In Australia 3/5 will be Voting for next Prime Minister.

I wanted Bret to ask " how many of you voted Republican in the past " I bet few if any of the DOGE team would have answer "Me" these men love America more than either party :) / []
37:19 Is rare to see Elon get emotional like this, at the end he actually sounded upset / []

The people stole my niece social Security to apply for SSI . / []
spare a dollar.... broke billionaire asking? / []
Tariffs help us create 1 trillion dollars in new revenue from the tariffs and from the industry or economic growth the tariffs help create. Add this trillion to one trillion in budget cuts and we balance our country's budget and start paying down our debt. If we do not do this, we go bankrupt.. If the US fails at this, the world fails. That is why Musk and several other prominent billionaires are coming out of the woodwork to make this happen because if the world fails,  they would fail as well. Democrats and the deep state realize this. They want it to happen so they can control the new form of digital currency that would take over the world.  They want our country to go bankrupt and to control everything we do. It would be Atlas Shrugged coming to fruition. / []
Great Job DOGE ! / []
Americans needs less money, I need it / []
I'm glad you all did this. Thank you on behalf of my children and their children too come from keeping the country from going bankrupt. Most of us get it, but for those hearing all the negative they need to realize the true nature of the problem and just how much danger we were in, no one wants to believe the country would fail its hard for them to grasp it could be a reality if we dont cut. / []
there is so much waste, I want it in my pocket. / []

The first question (in layman’s term) was “how are you planning  on making more money?” I like trump, I voted for trump, I’m being patient with trump. But his motive is being more obvious with each budget cut or tariffs. He wants to make America rich (The government not the people.) But I’m being patient and letting time unfold. / []

Modernisation of old, legacy IT systems and digitisation of government records are probably the biggest challenges that private and public sector companies face and the biggest contributions these guys can make. They, however, should stay away from softer issues/projects that require social and emotional intelligence.   The one on one with Elon Musk is disturbing. He wants to go after who? The people that report lies and their funders? He wants to go after the left media? Is he hearing himself? / []
This was eye opening. Every American knew this was happening. Americans all need to be supporting this Administration. / []
28:56 This is something I believe strongly, we have the very same problem in Sweden. / []
After doge does its work at the federal level which is good on itself, it should be also targeted at the state level and finally to the municipal level.that will really make a difference down to the very existence of the financial issues we are having.  Just my 2 cents 🇺🇲🇺🇲 / []
I'm curious to see if the fraudsters are going to be brought to justice. That's the reason why all the Democrats are going to do what ever they can so the ATM that is making many politicians rich while we are struggling to pay the bills and they could care less about the American people / []

The Democrats have nothing but lies! Their scam is over! / []
First, let me say that I voted for Trump 3 times. So I voted for his policies, good or bad. But I have a major complaint about what DOGE did to some colleges, one in particular being the one my son goes to. My son was working toward a doctorate in environmental engineering,  and the program got defunded. My son's goal came to a screeching halt. I don't think it's wise to defund STEM courses, as the US can use all the brainpower it can get in order to compete in this world. Some things need to be audited before they just get blow up. / ['You expect the government to pay for your sons course? Like a scholarship?']

To Mr. Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE : If you make a left wing political anger or democratic rejection (at least as long as there is a Trump, Elon or Doge derangement syndrome), that means you are right. You walk on the right path. / []
The path to dictatorship with the help of Trump supporters has already begun.  And the populist Fox channel is supporting the future dictator Trump and distorting the truth! At some point they will wake up - but then it will be too late!  This country is more unfree than it has been for a long time. The problem with the list of decrees: it's the list to undermine democracy! The Republican fight against freedom is also on the rise at the US state level - especially when it comes to women's rights.  After almost two months of Trump, we can say that there is a kind of perverse competition to curtail freedom. What worries me most for the coming months is that Trump has incited his supporters to enforce his anti-freedom policies on a day-to-day basis.

Also, though the mother earth resources are limited and the life of the mother earth is limited and become shorter unless we, all the people on earth, is aware and use the resources effectively without wasted by bad late comers who repeat the same mistakes of the past when we already have such a brainy and enthusiastic brainy people who can efficiently utilise resources if they are all with certain ethics as these people seem to have, especially, from what they are saying.   It is more efficient and save earth, if all goes well and there are some economical functions to save common in brainy people, in terms of efficiency and scientific knowledges and experiences in the area of developments and improvements without copying with bad qualities! If we can all focus to do well by these people earth actually may prolong its life, too! But all world must be like minded, I guess.  This workd some are advanced and very good emotion control but some of the people are controlled by their emotions alone could be the problem of the world.  We must have all elements in our mind, yet, leaders of all societies in the world must operate with rational way of thinking! Like it seems these people are very rational and logical way of thinking to make the society better.  I admire these people’s brain power.  Not backwards emotionally controlled.  By the way, I am not the American, but I admire all the brain blossoms at the place of the land of the USA irrespective of their origin. I want my grandchild re live in resourceful and free world! / []

It’s funny how the liberals are saying he’s making all these spendings up. 😂   Here’s my theory, the money that was going to 9 month olds, money going to 150 year olds, etc, maybe those money went into the democrat politicians pockets. Maybe that could be the reason why their net worth is 20 million+ dollars when their salary is only 6 figures. / []

His was incredible. Gonna watch again!🎉 / []
all the poeple who are working against DOGE are and were beneficiary of all those frauds & scams happening in the government. / []
Elon is a super genius, he really understands the financial issues plaquing America and is determined to fix it. / []
Keep going ❤❤ / []
This admin wants peace and prosperity for all Americans, and govt to be efficient in its efforts. The hard earned money provided by the people in good faith must be spent wisely, it’s really that simple. The corruption amongst politicians is being exposed and that’s why they’re attacking. / []

Not American but as usual, I am in awe of the talent and your country’s ability to have such great leaders emerge from time to time. What a great team, vested in a great mission.

I listened and am intrigued.  I’m all for finding the waste and abuse as I have always known it occurs at a large number. However… Talk is cheap, until you have legitimately broke it down to the average American in understandable language.  With what I believe is a massive conflict of interest with Elon, I remain skeptical. I mean, he had 21 lawsuits against him, yet he is still receiving government contracts. IF IT’S FOR THE “AMERICAN” PEOPLE.. STOP THE PARTISAN BS.  It is NOT just one party that has created or even maintained these problems! / []
This is what America needed! / []

I feel elons the closest to a Bruce Wayne or Tony stark we will ever get. If I was to put my life in hands of a billionaire he'd probably be it. I never understood the hate for him even before siding with trump. He seems like a good guy to me he's a Lil odd compared to the average person. But in a good way like how when asked something doesn't just shout first thing in mind he actually takes a moment to think before opening his mouth. Him buying Twitter was one the biggest things saved free speech from becoming priveledged speech. Like the dems tried to make it out to be. All they're exposing now imagine if could expose things in previous years. How long have they been doing what they do. 20 years ago it might not been alot of woke crap. But was probably something similar going on wasting money filling a few dirt bags pockets. / []

this is so amazing to watch  - imagine, all these  extremely successful, highly intelligent and accomplished citizens using their knowledge and skills to make a major, hugely positive difference in the everyday lives of their fellow men. this is how society should work - those that have so much, give back to improve the day to day lives of their countrymen and the future generation. this is what will really make a society thrive. it won't be easy but real change never is so I can only hope that the rest of the world follows.  thank you very much. / []
Big THANKS to the DOGE Team for all y'all are doing for our country!  To all those who have an issue with the cuts on wasteful spending & fraudulent activities, please feel free to personally finance the programs you're interested in...  no one is stopping you from putting your money where your mouth is!

This should have aired on national television!!! Great work from each of you and thank you on behalf of all grateful Americans! / []
what's wild is many americans who MUST do a monthly budget to make it... to then learn that our government has NO checks and balances, NO oversight, NO accountibility -- and just spend spend spend - we ARE tired of this!

Filing cave? WTH? Let’s goo!!!! / []

Re. medical research, and this is only the US. There is global research being replicated because databases don´t connect. If it didn't involve animal testing that would not be a problem. But the sad reality is that beings are being tortured in the name of medical research and that also needlessly in duplications. However, there are medical systems and ways that don´t require animal testing via spreadsheet research. / []
There doing an awesome job ❤ / []
Oh yeah a fraudster changed my address on a Capital One Credit Card, the address was changed to some place In New York, so my statement was sent to a fraudster. / []

So, the computer systems are not interfacing with each other. So, now we have that in our pocket. Now, are they not interfacing with each other by design??? It seems quite clear that all of these problems are in fact intentional but when discovered, they can be redirected and absolve the beneficiaries of any wrongdoing. The entire non-government of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is comprised of skilled fraudsters who endeavor to exploit every nook and cranny to separate the hard-earned dollars from the electorate and secure them for themselves!!! / []
WE LOVE YOU ELON. ❤ YOU ARE AMAZING. / []
Thanks for putting this on YT / []
They purposefully did nothing to update and upgrade the system to maintain their high-paying jobs and create even more federal jobs and waste......all at the taxpayers' cost and to the detriment of retirees, disabled, and medicare/medicade recipients. / []

The Democrats hate saving money. They demand wasteful spending... / []
There are so many people that aren't seeing this have to find a way to have this interview in front of the entire population I don't know how that's possible but there are people out there smarter than me but that will ease everybody's mind Democrats or just watching Democratic channels they're not watching Fox so they don't know and people are panicked because they don't know what these people are doing / []
The Social Security administration offices should open their doors back to walk in to see them in person instead of having them to go on line it is more convenient for everyone to do it like they have always helped the citizens not have them call for an appointment and have them wait for hours just to get an appointment in a week or two, when if you walk in you get everything done right there and don't have to come back again, the people who work in the Social Security administration just don't want to work 😮 to help these people that need their help, I used to go in and there are more than 20 windows to help people when they come in but there are less working for the administration that if you see 4 people helping all these people who come in are not helped by them because they don't put enough of them working on the windows that are there, that you can see them walking around and why doesn't anyone do something to help our senior citizens who are there for the Social Security administration to help their seniors 😮, it's so wrong 😮😢 / []
By the way, Doge means “King.”  My ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War to get rid of a king and I’ll be damned if I let you Russian loving SOBs proclaim Donald I the new one. / []
They say this on repeat a 1000 times but won't say where the money is now. Sorry my Murican friends, if you think that money will somehow magically appear in your pocket you don't understand how and why capitalism works. / []

I have seen many article that they keep editing the mistake they made on their website 😂 piers / ['Elon will do more in one hour than you will do in your whole life.']
You won't see this on CNN or MSNBC or most other MSM outlets because it doesn't fit their narrative. They only want to make trump and elon look as bad as possible because that's what they are paid big money to do. Democrats own most MSM so that is why they constantly bash and lie about anything and everything that the Republicans do. They even make stuff up now because they are extremely desperate right now because the American people have  realized what is going on because they were so crazy over trump that they exposed their disgusting propaganda, lies and showed us how weaponized the government is with the democrats and how they will stop at nothing to win. / []
Amazing work by Doge, and its just so plain stupid to be angry at Tesla. Totally nuts! / []
They've actually lost money. By firing IRS, they lost lots of revenue. / []
AMAZING / []
DOGE is a machine! Well oiled machine. Amazing! / []
Share this everywhere.  Elon is a national hero / []
I admire president Trump, Elon Musk and all these great people. / []
At the end of this if you still can not see the true PATRIOT that is Elon Musk and the true desire to do right by Americans.....Then there is no help for you. Just sit still and stop complaining. / []
This is how patriots look like / []
Explaining what's going on with DOGE. Don't listen to the media or democrats who have ulterior motives for complaining and making it difficult for others in this very important department that's cleaning up the junk. / []

God bless Elon, Vivek, the entire DOGE team, Trump and his cabinet, America and Americans.  Let all evil be destroyed in the name of Jesus. / []
If there were somewhere you could bet on this, I would put both my houses on the fact that they will continue to announce massive numbers but never name names. / ['Both my houses says everything . And yes they’ve given names']

Thanks Fox, this was awesome!   This is a great help understanding what DOGE is looking at. / []
28:34 what a dumb question! Yes, they are stopping it! / []
eye opener!   Thank you! / []
government saving banks, banks now saving government is a paradox. / []
Every country should be ran by a businessman - politicians live in a pantomime; they have no clue on how the real world functions. / []
This is a cool platform, Bret talking to Elon and these guys, I like it / []
DOGE is revealing all the ways we're being fleeced and robbed.  We are the World's economic leaders. We should have zero debt.   The world revolves around the US dollar...no way we should ever be in debt. Elon found the grift. / []
Which one is Big Balls? Asking for a friend. / []
All of the protestors against DOGE and MUSK should be ashamed, these patriots are saving America. Brain washing from the left to fight this, shows how rich they are getting from kick backs and back room contracts. / []
That is why we really need a rocket scientist with a tech background for this doge task because they can do so much more than a traditional accountant or auditor with their conventional ways of doing things. / []
I am 100% with what you are doing Elon and everything President Trump has done and is doing however I am smiling as I am sure these guys work in jeans and sneakers and Elon bought them suits and ties on the way to this interview :) / []
You are messing with the source of political money  junkies. They are fearing withdrawal without their fiscal fix and are pulling a major TANTRUM!!!  Love you all. Keep up the good work!! / []
This is awesome! As Indian, we would want our version of DOGE.   Which sane person can oppose efficiency?  Great work team DOGE 🙏 / []
That "FOR WHAT" at the end just gave me goosebumps. That's the reality of every war unfortunately. / []
I love Elons passion for Peace.  What Doge is doing will go done in history as the great reformation against corruption. We are living an incredible time in not only America's History, but the History of the World. / []
what is that crying sound at 37:05 and 37:13 that elon even stops and acknowledges??? / []
Solid 20 mins of how there saving billions of dollars   It’s so weird   Billions of savings? Most Americans have no idea how those billions so called saved are helping   It just all sounds like a story  A written story of doing good with the actual outcome being   Reality…. All Americans we are the many and they are the minority and they do not care about the many so any billions of savings   We may eventually get a crumb but they will ultimately get the majority of all benefits / []

It all sounds reasonable to me / []
Everyone should SHARE this video. / []
I wonder what Elon was saying in the video after 11:23 / []
Elon is a great guy. He doesn't need to do this but he is because he cares about the American people. The left lunatics is trying to ruin his Tesla business. I just bought a tesla yesterday in support of Elon. Keep it up Elon thank you for what you are doing. MAGA.. / []
So a person become a billionaire by just conducting general surveyor. Wonder the United States have so much bogus billionaires in Forbes magazine. Nothing to be proud of. / []
Any network not airing this interview is doing a great disservice to the American people! These men are the greatest thinkers and problem solvers of our time. Meanwhile, the democrats just like to complain and shout without any real solutions! / []

Awesome interview.  Love these people that are standing up for us. GOD Bless them. Elon we stand with you and what your doing. Thank you / []
Get rid of Elon and I’ll listen. This dude is the fakest human alive, everything he does is to line his pockets and interests. DOGE as an idea is great, however if Elon is involved in any capacity. Then it’s a shame / []
❤💯❤ / []
I'm so glad this is happening. we owe these guys a lot. / []
Are the fraudsters found? Names? Bank accounts? / []
The loudest and most desperate fraudster is Elon Reeves Musk himself.  He is found involved in premeditated sophisticated high-tech organized criminal racketeering against US government and it's citizens. / []
So real ❤❤❤ / []
My husband just received a significant cost of living boost to his Soc Security payment! We were gratefully stunned! Thank you DOGE! / ['Wow, really?', 'SSA determines cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) every October based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Has nothing to do with DOGE...', '\u200b@sageakporherhe783No, not really.', 'My husband did also', "I feel as though you're lying"]
I really dont see how anyone can continue to hate Elon after this interview.  They will, but they shouldnt.  I see a man that greatly cares and believes in what he is doing, and for nothing but the good of this country. / []
Why did the far left media portray the DOGE team were a bunch of kids in their 20s that were hired running this? I dont see any kids here. / []
I wish we have this kind of patriots in australia / []
Come on, these guys are actually saving the country. They are heros! So stop your ego of hating DOGE. Seriously, I condemn the Dems trying every way to stop what DOGE is doing. / []
This is bloody awesome! / []
The left will only scream about how Elon is stealing the money for himself or the wealthy. How? By not wasting money being wasted? This is insane that people are actually against our government actually run properly. How dare them. / []
These men are a great team. They deserve recognition and praise. They're helping America lose some weight. / []
The only criticism comes from people who receive free money / []
Could somebody near to this man ask HIM TO PLEASe take some sleep and hopefully two or three days off ,even if he loves what he is doing for this country, this country needs him in good health / []
Great work great team / []
Thank u doge team!! / []
Fox as stepped up a gear in there coverage 💪💪.  This is the a team who are willing to put there necks on the line for there country.   I can only wish we had this here in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 / []
If you are against these guys you are the enemy / []
Retirement process…. If you are considering retiring from the workforce in the near future, one of the most important things you'll need to know is how long it will take for you to start receiving your Social Security retirement benefits after you apply for them. While it generally takes approximately six weeks for an application to be processed, it is advisable for you to initiate the process three months before you want to receive your first benefit payment. / []
Fantastic!! Great job guys 🇺🇲 / []
The democrats re the one s stealing  OMG wake up dude / []
The AirBNB guy? Gtfo, Doge is cooked / []
Musk and doge team is a once a lifetime national treasure that we are so blessed to have. Thank you Jesus. / []
It's greatly appreciated thank you!!!!!!! / []
great job team! and to the journalist / []
Top notch reporting.  Your interview of the DOGE team provided insight to their goals. their findings and the improvements being made. Thank you. / []
Wow just wow, so glad I watched this. / []
IMHO the people fueling and the people perpetrating all this violence and anti-Musk nonsense are not really evil, they are just dumb as dirt.  Same as the BLM crowd, same as the anti-Israel crowd....just a pack of bandwagon-jumping morons.  Wake up America. / []
Do you think the federal government should consider revising gun laws to allow individuals with non-violent, non-sexual, and non-drug-related convictions to regain their Second Amendment rights after, say, 10 years?  Many people—often convicted of "blue collar" crimes in their early 20s—have made genuine changes in their lives. Shouldn’t there be a path to redemption for those who’ve shown they’ve reformed?  Not all felons are the same. Some were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, took responsibility, and faced the consequences. Seems only fair we consider giving them a second chance, right? / []
Elon thank you very much and sorry for our stupidity. God bless you !!! / []
We need a group like that in England / []
Low income MAGA supporters will suffer, then what happens? / []
The guys are not only brilliant but you can tell they care!  If you are against this, you are against the sustainable future of America 🇺🇸 / []
Come to my country with your team, after your done Elon😂🎉. Greetings from Malaysia / []
Next step: ACCOUNTABILITY! / []
Good job guys but more needs to be done in different levels of government / []
Thank you team Doge for caring enough about the USA and the people to step up and serve in the way. You will forever have my gratitude. / []
Wow, there nothing but Republican and DOGE bot all talking to each other in comment section.  It sure real. / []
STAY THE COURSE...THANK U, ELON...🦅🇺🇲 / []
What a group of Quacks. Unbelievable. They post wrong figures and then take them down. Let whole departments go and then hire them back. / ['Yep Elon lied they fired 25000 and Court ordered to hire them back scalpel my arse!']
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸God Bless America! / []
American patriots at work. You never get a team more capable than this in the government. / []
How do other countries manage taxpayers' money? / []
Vandalism. / []
You are the best / []
Can they look at the UK after  ...  ? / []
These guys are heroes / []
Their mission is to raise my car insurance. / []
Wait. The US government only has 800 billion in the bank? We spend 6-7T a year!? Wow. DOGE and this team is a godsend. We need DOGE 19:49 / []
Oh now you guys like African Americans and Immigrants taking jobs? Lmao / []
Their only goal is to make money. Period. I wish they had good intentions. But it's all smoke and mirrors to move policy in a way that benefits them. If it benefits anyone else it is just coincidence. / []
wow / []
This fox is all Extremism and bots. it is crazy / []
When you're ready to build USAWG water grid Elon Musk I'll build it. I own a successful distillery and will donate my time to be a patriot and support America. / []
Can't wait for then to find out where the money has gone for the citizens over 120. Chuck Schumer is trying to cover his tracks. / []
Hold these Far left BS and lock’em up / []
Just ordered a Tesla.  Will continue to adjust my views when the light is shown and spend my money to support those who seek the truth. / []
Why doesn’t musk want Russia to stop fighting, and blame Ukraine? / []
God speed gentleman. Praying for all things to become known. Thank you for taking on this huge task for America / []
hese people are doing an awesome job Whoever criticizes this is not right in the head / []
Keep it going! / []
We need to start hearing more from Big Ballz / []
Go DOGE / []
Maybe now we might see an actual cure for a disease- as opposed to a continuous stream of very expensive drug SUBSCRIPTIONS. They never seem to come up with an actual cure for any disease- ever. / []
Democrats don't want new dytem that all t as lk to each other!!!  THEY WANT TO EASILY HIDE THEIR THEFT!! / []
We have gotten to a point in our sick society where the heroes are being crucified. These guys are all, no exceptions, multi millionaires, and are doing it for free. Leaving wives, kids, and their own business behind to put the USA first. Thank you very much for your job. You will be on the history books. / []
CNN is too busy lying to people for anyone to know about this / []
You cant a Ask for better accountability than that. It's crazy that you find people fighting this team. / []
Thank you all for saving America ❤ / []
Ty Elon! / []
Oversight and appropriation is the role of Congress, not the oligarchy. So get lost, Elon, no one elected you. / []
Bret’s hair is incredible. / []
I love that you can hear what I can only imagine is Stilwell Darling running around in the background during the q&a portion with Elon at the end 😆 / []
By far one of the most educative and inspiring group interviews I have ever watched. These guys literally risked everything to save America from near certain insolvency and collapse, in the face of so much push back, hate and violence from so called leftists and progressives / []
Thank you D.O.G.E team for you're patriotic kind selfless action to help fix a once very proud and powerful nation that the demon rats have destroyed with our money back to the people. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET THE SOCIAL SECURITY I SO DESPERATLY NEED TO JUST SURVIVE. THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!!! / []
Excellent interview. All those men should be honored. They may save America from a becoming desolate wasteland riddled with lawlessness. Thank you, Gentlemen.   Thanks, Brett. / []
love this.  pure service / []

This is what we voted for. Maybe I wont have to work until 75 just to recieve a liveable social security. Go DOGE / []

Americans should share it with your friends and family. You need to go out of your echo chambers / []
Very lucky he is on America’s side. Great choice by President Trump. The team Elon has put together boggles the mind. Brilliant group, top of the line. America is grateful. / []
Awesome. Thank you   PROUD OF ALL THESE MEN FIGHTING FOR THIS COUNTRY.  🙏🙏🙏💕💕💕👏👏👏 / []
Where is big balls 😂 / []
I think the Democrat party is in very serious trouble and it will take decades for them to dig themselves out of this. / []
Perfect team / []
Come look at how the UAE government has streamline absolutely every single government process. They did an amazing job. Anything You need to submit or request or recover is at You fingertips. Parking. Home affairs. Visas. Sick leave certificates anything You can think off. Digital efficiency that really just works. / []
Any American that doesn’t agree with this has to have an agenda… I cannot understand any other way to look at this. It’s confusing to understand why any American would be angry about it! / []
Now we know which Country on earth is the most corrupt. / []
Sadly, not a single Democrat or liberal will watch this and change their mind, despite how simple and rational what D.O.G.E. is doing is, and it's actually good for them and our country / []
Phenomenal team! / []
What a great interview, thank you!! Thank you Doge Team!!!! / []
You don’t see any of this kind of panel in Biden’s time nor even before any other president’s time. They doing an amazing job. Thank you. And i’m not even american. / []
I'm just curious though is this money that was being spent every year when they say they found a program that got 10 million or 10 billion dollars is that every single year they got a payment / ["I can't remember if they said it was every year that type of amount is being paid or if it was that amount over the last 10-20 years for everything. Like the Stacy Abrams 2 billion was in one year so I am going to say it was every year."]
I mean the fact that the interview is being done by someone who is clearly wants to put you in a positive light is clearly bias   Country doesn’t want to go bankrupt he says?   What does that mean? How is what your doing helpful to everyday people? You’re saving money? Are you? And If so with all these millions no billions your finding   Where is it going now? / ['Govt is paying a trillion dollars in interest on loans taken out to fund waste and be abused. Can you imagine what a trillion dollars a year would do for the people of the country', 'All the money they find and can stop can be recollect by congress and congress can allocate it to the debt, back to the people, or use it toward next years budget.']
This is beyond outstanding.. thanks Bret and all of you for doing it. It's beautiful what they are all doing and Elon is a gem of gems. And I share Elon's emotion about those dying in wars lately for nothing!!  We are so fortunate to live in the time with Elon. / []
Sound is really weak / []
Does he consider government spending on any if his companies fraudulent and wasteful? I'll wait....... / ['No, because it is not']
for YEARS, almost as a generational tradition, the people of this country have been saying the gov't is misspending tax dollars. People are trying to stop it when its actually happening? Nah, i really do think its the lackeys that are getting paid to do so to peddle the bs cus cmon. It almost sounds fake how billionairs are actually trying to save america money because of the future of their children. It sounds so fake that people are defending actual bombings. I hope this is an eye opener for people. Stop getting fleeced. / []
I do applaud what the DOGE had accomplished and continue to do. Elon Musk and the Team are true American patriots. It was good that Bret Baier did this wonderful face-to-face discussion that was so delightful to watch/ listen to. / []
It’s clear. The federal government has become a money grab of taxpayer dollars. This must stop. Why are democrats in particular so resistant to accountability. / []
The problem with the Dems is if they let DOGE be successful that is the end of them. No more voting democrat. They know this and they are doing whatever it takes to bring down Trump’s progress with our economy and government efficiency. / []
Which one of these guys is big balls? / []
What an idiot. Not even an elected government official. / ['He is an idiot huh. And you\'re the genius? What companies have you built? How many people have you given a job to, and paid their salary cheque so they can feed their families? "But but ... he\'s just such an idiot. What an idiot he is..."']
Best show i have seen all week / []
Lord Jesus we pray for your mercy, grace and protection for these brave doge group.  May your hand lead them and bless them, amen. / []
I mean are these guys heroes or what. I've heard it said that the United States as a country is sort of like a 19 or 20 year old in history terms.. Obviously the people that were in control of the money had no self-control and really made bad decisions and flat out reckless behavior.. Bad people out there and they're going to try to put roadblocks in their way and do whatever they have to do but I'm very proud of these men taking care of business for all of us for a great the grandkids the great-grandkids and generations ahead.. Hopefully they put in laws and controls that cannot be changed in the next 800 years.... Good job guys.. I sure would like buy you guys a couple beers... / []
Am I the only one who heard that background noise? Scroll to 36:50 through 37:30. A baby maybe? 🤔🧐👂👀 nonetheless... YAY DOGE!!🦾🧠💾💸📈⚖️ / ['At one point you see Elon near the look to the side it was probably one of his kids.']

Dodge draffters / []
Shumer should be censured for knowingly lying in order to spread fear. / []
The Democratic Party has and is doing everything in their power to make the Country go bankrupt so they achieve their ultimate aim which is total dependence by the populace on them, I.e.,  Communism. / []
So no doge checks 😢 / []
If he was all about efficiency why spacex got 40b from the government? / []

You saved a billion dollars on a survey company? So where is that money going now? I wonder Elon / []
The idea of ​​Orange and his gang running a country like a corporation had already been implemented by European fascists, such as Benito Mussolini in Italy. Fascists overthrew parliaments, forcibly overthrew governments, and created their own power structures. / []

I'm so grateful for your efforts, thank you sir / ['Elon AI bot allert', 'The new illegitimate government censor free speech. not they go after the free press and journalists.. they also censor free speech on truth social and X. they even go after youtubers and content creators. they are simply projecting.. everything they claim the other part to do.. they do themselves']

President Trump is the charioteer that is guiding the country thru rough terrain, there has to be atleast five terms like this to get the country on the right track and stay that way, anyway you look at it, it is America finally breaking to the surface from the depths finding its confidence and gaining its self respect back, it is becoming assertive on the world stage and other countries and people will understand that this is the new America who knows that ahead of fear is victory.

I'm 57 from the UK. I am so proud of these gentlemen using their time and skills to make America great again.

You all realize how FOX news has always positively viewed Trump. You wouldn’t fine another news station more in favor of him. When trying to look at things critically look at who they support instead of looking at both sides. Elon has yet to go before a committee to account for what he’s doing and what’s being done with public information, what access does he have etc. Why in front of Fox News but not in front of government. / ['Access was already spoken of as READ ONLY access(read about IT system read/write attributes if you need clarification of what this means).  Secondly, DOGE is an official government website(google it if you must)...  The website lists EVERYTHING they have done, not in extreme detail, but every area they have worked on.', '"You all realize how FOX news has always positively viewed Trump. You wouldn’t fine another news station more in favor of him."  Do you know what that would be?  I have a simple idea;  they are the one and only right-leaning major TV-media company.  When you study how advertisers influence TV stations which influence politics so politics can then grant whoever advertises or helps to fund the TV stations, you will see how the dots are connected to create a system with a \'hidden\' agenda.', "Also, if you think about it...  How come only one right-leaning major TV company?  Do you think possibly the advertisers are more 'in bed' with those willing to profit in inefficient means so they have lots of extra spending money???  ;)  I'll stop now before I write a book for you lol."]

Elon was really powerful in the last moments of this interview, he had me in tears. He is right; All this killing for what?....Nothing! He said a lot in a very short time.

Great PR for DOGE. Unfortunately, it isn't the whole story. We're talking about a trillion dollar goal and they're giving stories that create hundreds maybe thousands of dollars in savings. Not to mention, no one is talking about how they are going in and dismantling entire departments without the infrastructure to take care of what's being dismantled. Telling only part of the story is always a great sales tactic. / []
40% of the social security are going to fraudsters.. / ['This is huge !', 'EVIDENCE? 😂 OR IS THE TYPICAL "TRUST ME BRO" FROM AN AUTISTIC AFRICAN INVADER GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?😂']
Great interview with Elon Musk, he's the example of a True Patriotic American Citizen. Thank you for your help, service, and sacrifice Elon Musk. Keep going strong, real Patriotic American Citizen support what you are doing with DOGE. / []
This is what "draining the swamp" is ❤ / []
If the government goes bankrupt, the only ones getting $ will be the ones  who bankrupted the government . For getting kickbacks. Literally Socialism at its best. Look at Venezuela! / []
Where is Amy Gleason, the DOGE administrator who is supposedly the person that reports to the White House chief of staff?  Why is Elon Musk making all the decisions about these organizations without input from experts within these systems?  Propaganda... / []
Il doit réduire ta tête musk 😂😂 plutôt tête de 💩🖕 / []
I hope in the end, the goals are met, and that Elon and the team are given the highest civilian honors. Keep saving our money guys. / []
21:31 omg, I want social programs, people who want these programs should be happy this is happening / []
All American should watch this put this on tunes big screens super markets and every decent radio stations American grow up 😢😢😢 / []
Thank you Elon, And your team! / []
Wow, MAGA Nazis trying to look human….and failing…. / []
Good stuff.. Lets share this to all of Americans including the hard headed Democrat people... / []
U go Elon u and your whole team. Your amazing. The courage you all have to help America,  absolutely putting your lives on hold to do this for our Country.  I for one thank your for the service!!!! And our president for making it happen / []
Is there a Democrat that can tell the truth? / ['Trump is literally an AJUDICATED R8PIST and CONVICTED FELON! TRUTH!😂']
All lies and empty promises like Trump / []
Voted Democrat in every election since 1988 except for 2024 (and no I didn’t vote for Trump).   With that said, I wholeheartedly support the mission of Elon Musk and DOGE. It’s mind blowing how many Americans (and their confirmation bias and/or political views) won’t look beyond themselves and support this.  This is not about bipartisan rhetoric…it’s about fixing our nation. / []
MIND BLOWING! / []
this sucks 😢everybody is so up in arms about being MADD / []
Great sit-down. We needed it; DOGE is doing so much that we need to hear it from them. unscripted too... awesome! / []

DOGE is Wonderful 💯 / []
Gov emploees and politicians treats the money as theirs, they need to learn its the other way around. They work for the people and its the peoples money / []
I hope you at DOGE find ways to materially reward those employees who find ways to reduce waste and improve efficiency and service. The government needs to start employing some of the motivators used in the private sector e.g. bonuses and recognition. You get what you reward. / []
Why don't cut the Musk contracts? Save how many millions? / []
These men are heroes.   God bless them all.  The indifference from our govt over time is horrifying. / []
Covif time Did they gave out loan and grants to undocumented not even have had green cards? Only had id and tax id. / []
I love Elon Musk, there I said it. Ur homeboy here in South Africa🫡 / []
THE WORLD IS BLINDED, BUT ESAU IS BARE TO THE ELECT So just as to the world, there is no clear-cut indication as to where the children of Israel are today; so also to the world, there is also no clear indication as to where the children of Esau (Edomites) are today.  2 Esdras6:9 / []
Spot on Elon! / []
The USA is amazingly blessed with hard working people but was on the brink of collapse had it been for President Trump and Dodge. Now, I see why the deep state is fighting hard and resisting in evert way. I always wonder anyone with the right mind could be against DODGE? If the nations fails it doesn't matter how rich you are it means nothing. God bless Mr. Musk and all the team sacrficing everything to save the USA / []
❤ / []
Thank you Elon for being such a great patreon and all these men that are dedicated to help America, God bless you guys. / []
Elon is a lying DOGe! I want the CATe back! The Commissioners that Audit and Track efficiency in Govt, Namely, the US Inspector Generals!!!! / []
Need to come over and sort our government / []
So that's where Elon's false reality is based, with regard to Ukraine:  In the false belief that those who support Ukraine don't have a solution. But WE DO HAVE A SOLUTION; Elon simply doesn't want to acknowledge it. So it makes sense that he would see it the way he does. He needs to open up his eyes & learn the facts, even if he believes he already has, because if he has, he's definitely missed something - like the fact that there are many solutions that've been put forth by many people. Kowtowing 2 nuclear blackmail seems 2 b more Elon's speed. / []
Elon respect due, but let us people talk they are good. / []
wow, its been a bit of a free for all.. no wonder some are upset loosing free access to free stuff! all public owned and run business needs a DOGE / []
Can we clone the DOGE team for South Africa? 🥺Pretty please? - This is incredible! I'm in awe of what the DOGE team is doing every day. / []

Thank you Elon Musk and the DOGE team for your great and timely efforts to save America from falling into the abyss of wastes and frauds at the federal government level. President Trump and you guys at DOGE for sure will be remembered in American history as patriots who help rescue the country from going extinct. / []
Elon first said 2T will be saved, now it is 1T. And so far they found 0.18T which includes half one time things. / []
🇺🇸 / []
My salute and lots of prayers for President Trump, Elon Musk and the DOGE Team for their undying service to save America.. Regarding Ukraine, those politicians who support Ukraine knew all along the truth about what is happening in Ukraine and why Putin invaded Ukraine. There are more than 40 bioweapon labs created in Ukraine by a former US President. One former US President own a 200 acres property in Ukraine for child trafficking. According to a report, there are 8 million children missing every year. I hope and pray everything will be disclosed soon to expose evilness. Why do you think President Trump signed Executive Orders 13818 & 13848 in 2018 and it is still in force???  GOD BLESS AMERICA & THE WORLD. / []
MORE MONEY not LESS MONEY … seems pretty straightforward, not sure why people are arguing with this / []

Wow! Whàt a SPIN! Now it’s a ‘scalpel’ and you want to be ‘carefull!? Thàt wasn’t the message you send out with your chainsaw, was it?  Al of a sudden you communicate what you should have done BEFORE you fired those ten thousands of people?? And because you had to rehire, due to a courtorder, you now all of a sudden are só respectfull and empathetic? 😂 Good thing there is some control over you being reckless. And then you create another BLAME that people who complain, because they’re worried, to be FRAUDSTERS, to justify that? Please.. You could have saved yourselfes the critique and the Tesla violence (anger) that you provoked yourself!  Did you ever hear of a communications oficer to, UPFRONT, INFORM the people about the goals, like you do in your businesses?   You found ONE baby, receiving a small business loan? WOW, you deserve a medal!  Truth is that the processes are to be modernised and can be made more efficient, cause, in time, they age,regardless. Thàt should have been the message, don’t you think? Thàt could have saved the costst of lawsuits and judges on the expence of the taxpayer! Moreover, saved yourself the critique ànd the backlash.   You emphasize your own casualties and (grand)children to play on emotions, but what about the victims of your actions?  You emphasize all kinds of ‘illegal’ benefits, but what about your own billion of dollars subsidies?   But you don’t like to admit all that, do you? / []
Thank you Elon. We Americans appreciate you. / ['Trump is a russian agent with codename  Krasnov , and was hired in 1987 by russia according to the chief of the Kazakstan intelligence service. .its obvious now why Trump is so afraid of Putin and extremely weak when putin is around .. there is zero pushback. against the dictator which is very strange  to look at..

You know these people are asking why they’re not putting it out there with all the other News cash places because if you told CNN and CBS and all these others, they lie about it and say it was Trump‘s problem. I mean it was Trump that started this stuff. This is years and years and years of stuff been going on long before Trump got in there this is needed to be straightened out a long time ago, but it did not because they kept doing it over and over and over where money was going out to people that were rich that did not need the money like Joe Biden, and all them and all the Democratseven if you showed it to them other people to put it on the news they would turn it around / []

Today, it still has 2.5 million employees with a population that has since grown by more than 100 million. We can all agree that that is amazing 👏  The Federal government is not the problem. He says giving tax cuts to the rich costing $8 trillion is the problem 🙄 / []
The majority approves! / []
As a taxpayer, I am so very grateful that President Trump created DOGE!  I simply cannot understand why so many Democrats are fighting this.  If they got onboard with this program, they would win a lot of credibility with the American people!  This isn’t political.  It’s about eliminating waste and corruption! / []

Brett Beir's interviews are always well researched and well presented👌🏼🤩😊 / []
Fox and other news outlets need to have more interviews, like this one! Most people do not know what DOGE is doing and what its ultimate goal is.  Almost all of main stream media publishes negative views on what DOGE has been doing.   I have viewed MANY left-wing podcasters bashing DOGE and misinforming their audience. The DOGE team should have MANY more of these appearances on popular podcasters programs to make their true purpose known to a much wider audience!!! / []

Everytime Elon Musk Opens his mouth, he's just making everything worse.  He's like a Redpill Dating Coach that refuses to show Receipts & Infields / []
Elon Musk is a great amongst this generation. What an incredible person. / []
It was in 1990s with the computers where managers went wild with corruption in editing and deleting public records in my state government. / []

I've never seen so much bird turd in one room.  The ponzi scheme are these guys saying one thing and doing another.  They haven't changed much of anything.  This is all a plan to put "back doors" and "trojan horses" on all our government systems for their nefarious agenda. / []
I have never really been a Trump fan but this D.O.G.E thing has to go to his credit...i just hope it doesn't lead to everyone being enslaved and surveiled unnecessarily through more efficient government technology lol / []
Aloha All, Elon Musk & every person on the DOGE team are arch patriots who will save America if allowed to complete their work to rescue America & the fraudsters many of whom may well be dems like stacy abrams exhibit the most indignation & vehemence of rage, hyperbolic even false accusations? This is my view but please listen to this patriots & think for yourself. DO NOT TRUST CORPORATE MEDIA IS MY ADVICE ! Trust your own investigative powers & ability to think critically/rationally not irrational feeling rationalizations! AGAIN GOOGLE CENSORS MY VIEW & MY RIGHT TO  FREE SPEECH... / []
And the Left media never cared reporting this, all they care is if Elon has the security clearance and why DOGE hires 21 years old engineers / []
These changes to the social Security system is nice idea, but how people that living remotely and don’t have access to computers or wi-Fi . Or  the veteran that is bedridden and now quadriplegic, how are they going to do this? / []
If there is debt that,will grow why not put the DOGE savings on the national deficit, instead the DOGE savings are going to continuing tax cuts.  60% if the revenue of the tax cuts goes to the top 1%. It was already shown the rich did not create jobs and economic opportunity with the tax curs. The rich instead invested the money by buying back stocks.  The velocity og M2 is the lowest in 60 years. / []
Somebody should investigate the Department of Labor Grant division / []
I don’t understand / []
Thank you DOGE!!!!! / []
Where is “Big Balls” lol / []
It’s hard not to notice the war bird facing right. And the seal on the ground is facing left. / []
My respect for Elon Musk and the DOGE team. / []
Elon is blowing up socialism and the "New World Order" brick by brick.  Essentially making us free again.  To make our own decisions and prosper or die from it. / []
God bless Elon Mask, a compassionate and virtuous man as he is. Wish him and his team to be safe, stay strong and work further for the interests of American people. / []
PLEASE help our IGNORED AND NEGLECTED seniors and disabled who are forced to live in abject poverty, going hungry, losing their homes, can't get needed their healthcare, and have no one to assist them with ANYTHING. / []
The government spent decades inventing departments and services while selling them to the public about how impactful the service would be in their lives.  People forgot that the government is a bureaucracy that has no stewardship to reduce costs, or become efficient … only empire building that government officials use to justify higher pay because of the number of people they manage … along with all their staff. All of them getting golden retirement parachutes.  The private sector when they want to cut costs … they terminate a lot of jobs … just a number of people that match a cost cutting figure with no real analysis other than a feeling by executives on what is needed. After the cut they reassign the work and it either gets done or not.  The company will then find out if it can operate with fewer people or if it needs to refill some of those cut jobs … or will see if they can manage to come up with a workaround to make that job unnecessary.  Why would the government be any different. / []

Is justice going to be done? Are these fraudsters going to be charged and is money going to be clawed back? / []

Thankful these men r helping our country. / []
Billionaires + power = rich gets more richer and poor gets more poorer. / []
The thing which ought to concern most Americans is the TOTALLY PATHETIC STUPIDITY of those who believe the propaganda put out by the members of Congress and their obsequious cronies in the media.  Believe it enough to take the pay checks they receive from people who control disbursement of funds from 501c4  "charities". / []

Crazy how the democrats push the narrative that it was a bunch of 17 year olds running DOGE. These are some real  successful business people helping our gov. We have to face the reality that this version of America is what our kids need. / []
How could people hate this ?!? / []
They should have done this kind of interview from the get go. Sometimes, Elon doesn’t come off with empathy and so his methods are attacked. There is to much false info out there and people are reactive. The behavior of the Dems in all of this has been atrocious. The inciting of violence,  lies, and fear mongering is criminal. I don’t agree with everything this administration done but a lot of is fantastic. People don’t understand how the economy works and what it takes to get the debt down. They need more informative videos! / []

I'm all for Doge, but I'm honestly disappointed to see this team is made up of men only. That bothers me. But thank you anyways for your amazing work. / []
I appreciated everyone in DOGE team with all my heart. ❤️ / []
We need a Doge Team in South Africa. We have plenty of corruption in our Government. / []

I want Everyone to Be Blessed and Prosperious and Family and Memories and Leave Something Behind to Help your Children to Be Successful! / []
Reducing financial govt waste is alwaysa good thing. The American national debt is over 36 TRILLION dollars. Elon, literally, said in this interview that they intend to save only 1 TRILLION dollars out of that 36 TRILLION. They are also suggesting that because of their cuts, America will be “solvent.” He says this in the interview. The math isn’t mathing, America. 36 trillion minus 1 trillion = America is STILL in debt $35 trillion dollars. America, nor any country in debt by 35 trillion dollars,  will NEVER be able to pay their debt back. 1 trillion is a lot of money but nothing compared to the 35 trillion America still owes and will never be able to pay back. / []
Thanks for sharing this with the public team DOGE. ❤ I feel so much better now. Thank you for trying to save America. / []
I loved every second of this interview. Elon made some great points at the end also / []
Is that x cring at the end of interview / []
I love Elon Musk for sticking up for America and saving billions and eventually 1 trillion.  He really cares about America unlike  Demonrats, WEF and DEI Leftist imbeciles. / []
And every supporter in here hasn't seen no evidence of nothing / []
Thank YOU DODGE TEAM!!!! We are grateful / []
Too bad this message won't penetrate the lefties echo chamber. They will keep on being NPC's and screeching about Nazis and mean tweets. These men are doing great work! / []
Go DOGE - love from Australia / []
Imagine having to say "If a country goes bankrupt that's a bad thing". We're doomed. / []
Well done, DOGE!  Thank you, FOX! / []
It was wonderful…. Love hearing your updates & finding!!!! Keep fighting Elon , your team is doing great work!😊 / []

That's what I've always said! U can't Spend More than you Take in and that goes for the Government Also! These things We Tax Payers R Paying for is UNCALLED FOR! / []
It only the fraudsters who are up against this remarkable team. Let us give them the support they so dearly deserve. They are infact serving America from bankruptcy. / []
Lets go DOGE!!! *nobody referred questions to another department; everybody gave thorough, non-teleprompted non-word salad answers. We need more people like this team actually running our government. / []

Elon Musk is Awesome and they should be allowed him to do the job for the Nation / []

I see some people  commenting asking why this isn't shown nationally, or why isn't everyone able to see this or the like. The answer is simple, their feelings(fear), have no time for facts. Which is ok, because if they understood this, who would we point and laugh at? Many of those on the other side have consumed so much fear mongering content that there is little hope for them to save themselves, and even less hope for us to save them over the internet. Its sad to dismiss nearly a third of the country, but us who voted Trump in '16 and '20 already know what it's like to be demonized. / []
TESLA VANDALS are low hanging fruit, as well as the protestors.  Above them are small-fry proxy payment makers, trouble talkers and doers, and hard-nosed political activists.  While skipping the naming of the next set(s) of the chain of influencers and focusing on the highest level(s), it comes down ( as always ) "To Following the MONEY"!  Where do Politicians get so much "personal" money?  How do they get away with it?  They (not all) are the "pointed-end of the spear"!  And it"s obvious which Politicians and Party are paying for these underlings crimes committed.  They are not able to bribe The DOGE, so they seek terroristic tactics and propaganda.  They think that kickbacks are their entitlement. / []

You have some of the greatest intellectual and business minds setting aside their own work to come together and tackle wasteful spending and fix our debt—literally making America great again. They’re not getting paid to do it; they’re doing it because they are patriots. Thank you, Elon and your team. / ['Yea, Elon  and everyone else is all lying.']

Why cant the Democrats put Politics aside and support DOGE? I dont understand. / []
Government is inherently inefficient because it’s how they are able to justify the over abundance of employees.   Everyone knows profit motivations are a natural check on inefficiency. It’s also why socialism doesn’t work. If you need to see an example of socialism then compare these executives to the stories about waste and theft.    And for all you billionaires are this and that types like Bernie Sanders.  Remember this. If we were to round up and confiscate every dime from all billionaires in America, it would only put a small dent in the national debt. Not to mention all the workers that billionaires employ would no longer be paying taxes after losing their jobs.   Yeah. 5.5 trillion total billionaire wealth in America and the debt is 36.5 trillion. / []

Mr. Musk is in a position to be a great influence on things, in good ways, and in bad. I appreciate that he came from humble beginnings, and has been through his share of hardships. He has worked very hard to overcome things in his life, and earn the success he has had. Great successes takes great sacrifices for some people, he is one of them. Everyone should be held to an equal standard of expectations, to work hard, and persevere despite their challenges. Everything I've heard about the work that he, and the DOGE team are doing sounds right, and fair.  But, I hope he can practice empathy with the flawed, weak, disabled, mislead, lost people etc. ... We've all been in broken systems, in a broken society for a long time. It's hard to overcome these things, most people don't. I haven't read, or heard anything that makes me think he is a Christian man, that does make me uneasy, as I am a Christian. I believe leadership of our country is best in the hands of fellows Christians. My prayers are with Mr. Musk, the DOGE team, President Trump, and the rest of the people working with them though. I pray that they be lead by God to make the right decisions for the people in this country ❤️🤍💙🙏🏻 / []

these guys are ttrue american hereos and should be recognized as such. right beside our navy seals and other special ops teams / []
The Democrats need to grow a spine and denounce the attacks on Tesla at the least and get behind DOGE at the most. / []
God’s speed gentleman! / []
Go team!   This is what we voted for. Now Elon laughs about the 9 month old baby that got a business loan.   Always room for some jokes! Of course. Hahahahahaha 🇺🇸 / []
FOREIGN ROBBER BARON INVESTOR pretends to be inventor & genius.. then buys the POTUS. / []
Biden and Kamala were huge corrupt politicians and they supported every single foreigner in the government sector to do corruption and do lot of damage for every government sectors they never control nobody evil Biden and Kamala and democrats you guys will be in jail or HELL SOON 🔜☪️🤮🤮🤮🔥🔥☪️☪️🤮☪️🔥🔥☪️🤮☪️🤮 / []
These men are truly American Heroes. Thank God for President Trump, Elon Musk and these brave men supporting them! / []
I'm not a fan of Fox but i liked this interviewer / []
Why are so many people sitting on TV, why not working? They should improve their efficiency / []
Mark Kelly is a liberal beta mangina and I'm disgusted that he represents my beloved copper state. He's not even from here, he's from friggin' New Jersey. / []
Now to get Canadian people free of our idiots in government.. Pierre is only hope . Facts these men are very inspiring  Congratulations USA 🎉 / []
LORD BLESS THEM IN THIER EFFORTS! ( I PRAY)❤😂😊 / []
There was no pushback on all the things they said. The propaganda that this network is spreading will be the end of this country. / []
Thank god these guys aren’t greedy and are very humanitarian, underrated heroes. / []
Not a single question or mention of the defense budget.... I wish I could say I was surprised. 🫩 / []
They keep the wars going to keep the corrupt money going round and round. / []
Excellent interview / []
As a Foreigners - How is anyone in US OPPOSED to these. Like how, How are people against this!!!! / ['They are blind by hatred.. Democrats', "When you tackle corruption, there will obviously be some people who will be elated and other people who will upset that you're interfering with that corruption.\n\nThere's only one possible reason why someone would be upset about reducing corruption.", 'Wanna know why? Here:\n- he failed to ask why they cancelled the entire USAID program despite bipartisan approval by CONGRESS \n- musk said almost no one was fired. Grossy inaccurate.\n- he didn’t ask about Musks own $40 billion in government contracts']
We need the paper. We need the caves. Remember the Dead Sea Scrolls. / []
Notice how he completely dodged the question about AI being used in the government. Thats what all of this is REALLY about. The crazy thing will be how AI is being set up to run government and when the AI systems deem us inefficient for not joining their "efficient" system - we wont be able to buy or sell and will eventually be eliminated. Mark my words. / []
He’s so logical to dumb questions / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE Team! / []
We support Elon Musk and DOGE. / []
where is big balls tho? / []
They are true patriots and America is blessed to have them! Thank you all for your work to save our Country! 🇺🇸 / []

How do we get the brainwashed left to watch this interview? / []
Crazy stuff... this wastage.   How great is it that these businessmen have decide to give their time to fix things. That's awesome. / []
These corrupt thugs are worse than convicted felons. / []
Every American should be able to watch this! Why just Fox broadcasting? / []
What about Fort Knox? / []
Elon, could you say the same thing about the genocide happening in Gaza ? / []
Nail em / []
I’m not scared. These guys should be politicians, not hysterical clowns like Chuck Schumer. / []
Love it! / []
God help us / []
Thank you to all members of the Doge Team, especially Elon Musk, for taking care of the American people! / []
Why is this not on every television and every channel. / ["Fake news are enemies to truth that's why they are not showing the people this kind of greatness.", 'Media is a tool to control the people. Other medias are controlled and funded by some of these corrupted corps who have been leaching money from the gov.', 'I sow it on CNN,  the reality is that kids are the one showing at the administration office. This is just a damage control, puppet', "Because the left doesn't care about the people or the truth. All they care about is maintaining control of their cult members' minds.", "Probably because it's an interview by Fox.  Perhaps other networks could invite them on for interviews as well."]
A new age has risen. Congratulations from South Africa. The whole world needs to change and it will change. This is why war and instability is happening a great shake has to happen then only will the old school thieves will collapse. South Africa needs this system more than ever. Imagine the corruption in the world / []
CNN will take snippets and show them in a negative light. / []
This is so fkd up wut you guys are trying to do to me. / []
This is hard to watch and I'm not even an American. There's so much waste by I believe  deceitful people. Go DOGE, come to our country please 😁😁 / []
Thank you all gentlemen for your volunteer work you are doing to help Make America Great Again. I am looking forward to see the fabulous results in the near future. / []
I saw this live and was so impressed by these team members, their goals, their findings… basic common sense. / []
Speaking of Social Security, Here’s what really happened, WHO TOOK MY MONEY? ﻿  Actually, Democrat President Kennedy and Sergeant Shriver were the first ones to misuse the Social Security account.  They used Social Security funds to start the Peace Corps.   Not the first or last time our money has been taken from American citizens and given to foreign nations.   Things every US citizen should know and remember about Social Security and changes made:   A History Lesson on Your Social Security Card . . . Just in case some of you young whippersnappers (& some older ones) didn't know this.   It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it   Be sure and show it to your family and friends.   They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican . . . Facts are Facts  Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and card were not to be used for identification purposes.   Since nearly everyone in the United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message, NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION, was removed.   Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social Security (FICA) Program. He promised:  1.) That participation in the Program would be Completely voluntary. No longer Voluntary  2.) That the participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 of their annual Incomes into the Program. Now 7.65% on the first $90,000.  3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year. No longer tax deductible  4.) That the money the participants put into the independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore, would only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program. Under Democrat President Johnson the money was moved to the General Fund and Spent.  5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. Under Democrats Clinton & Gore Up to 85% of your Social Security can be Taxed.  Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away' -- you may be interested in the following:  Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it? A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically controlled House and Senate.   Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? A: The Democrat Party.   Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities? A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the US  Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants? A: That's right!   Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party.   Immigrants moved into this country, and at age 65, began to receive Social Security payments!   The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it!  Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away!   And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve.  But it's worth a try.

Hats off to all  these patriotic Americans.  I was in awe seeing that all these overly  successful men  giving their time to help our country. I do agree that without them agreeing to do this. They run their successful businesses so they know ins and outs, best software to use  to to know what is going on in company.   I see Elon getting emotional talking about the violence with Tesla. It must hurt so bad that this is what he gets back for doing something good.God bless these TEAM...the DREAM TEAM for our country.  Every American should be watching this. Please share it to everyone you know. / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE. We truly appreciate all you have done and continue to do 🇺🇸 / []
Elon at his best here / []

Elon Musk is a brilliant entrepreneur who will help Donald Trump efficiently to make America safe and great again. May God bless Elon Musk. / []
This team is epic. They are doing the job that every president has promised to do since their campaign began. And finally we are seeing it happen. But the people who are on the take ripping off the country are behind all of the negative press.  As an American Taxpayer, I am very happy and proud of this team. The amount of money they have already saved is staggering. And they aren’t taking any money from essential services. They are stopping the nonsense spending on frivolous things like drag queen shows and studying nonsensical things that are costing millions. / []

You would of had so much less push back if you hadn't started with firing people. Should of returned them to work then rif. 2.3m federal employees * 100k average salary = $200B. So you have to fire the entire work force to even notice a saving. It's like chopping your arm off to lose weight / []

I dont understand why woke denocracrts hating Elon..He is saving America n u ppl hate him for that?? / []
There are 2 ways for powerful folks running a country to make money. One is by relying on selling weapons, bombs that needs wars and people getting killed year round for more profits, accumulate debts, do corruption stealing tax payers money to fund lavish easy lifestyles, promote products and programs that ruin health, never really alleviating the suffering of the masses. Basically, money that has some blood on it. Another way to make massive money is by creating and selling modern peaceful technology products, cutting edge health solutions, well integrated IT systems, spending carefully, having accountability and so on. Looks like what is basically happening right now is America's historic transition from the former to the latter. Amazing times! / []
He’s actually talking trillions! 😂 he has gone too far now / []
a good start / []
How the HELL can any American want to punish Elon and his Tesla for what he is doing to serve USA! / []
This is a must see for everyone ! Thank you Mr Musk and the Doge team.. thousands times! Doge is one of the key elements of President Trump's golden age of America. / []
That's funny because deep investigation happens when a blk person applying for sba 😂 / []
Does anyone ever ask for documentation or proof for the claims? For example, the claim that there was a program to study menstrual cycles in transgender men: how do we know they didn't just make this up? Sounds like red-meat BS for their bigoted base. / []
U go Elon! / []

Thank you Elon and your team!!! / []

It is moslikly possible to reverse the debt clock. We have to ensure honesty and a system, spending cut itself will help, but not enough. / []
Exactly!!  We got a letter from the SBA about repaying the small business Covid loan.  It was our address but the company was…Boeing.  Yes they actually direct deposited money to a con artist under the name Boeing.  Thank heavens for my congressman who cleared it up immediately. / []
Real life heros / []
To me, it's mind blowing on the violence. 😊 / []
PATRIOTS  F  ALL THE OTHER CLOWNS MOCKING DOGE / []
They just put their loved ones at risk. How much is security monthly? / []
Great Job, Elon 'n Team!! Hope every Govt. across the globe can shown the savings and spending real-time as transparently as you have been doing! / []
We the people have been knowing this except the level of abuse from all levels of the government didn’t care about us. / []
It's not cool to drive all the way up to Mt. Rainier and not be able to be able to get in because of staff cuts to the National Parks. / []
Very informative, very encouraging. / []
Sad how his honest actions are intentionally misinterpreted / []
Thank you for your service to our country.  There are Americans that believe in what you are doing!! God Bless you and your families. / []
So informative!!!  How can ANY Americans be against this??!! / ['Because people have been brainwashed for a long time and some are just plain stupid lol', '@debrabatson6678 well, its because when the transparency is full of lies, its not transparency. Its still lies.', 'Because they hate anything Trump and Musk does, and the mainstream newschannels will not tell the whole truth.', 'Because the overarching goal for them is to sell out the government to for-profit corporations. From privatizing USPS, the national parks, education, prisons, etc etc.', "@debrabatson6678 I'm a member of the defense forces here in Northern Europe.

Look in California it's hard as hell to start a business / []
Anyone with half a brain that watches this interview would be inspired. It is amazing. So inspiring that we have these Genius type A personalities working together to Make America Great Again. / []
Most all of this Musk & Doge panel make sense to us, however in the concluding interview Musk berates pro Ukrain suporters for supporting needless killing of Ukrainian children. Now in that regard Musk is being totally two faced in that he supports Israel's wholesale killing of Gazan children & innocents who are entitled to be free of Israel's reoressions against them. In this regard Elon is being a two faced, Netanyahu kiss up, phony. / []
This is truly revolutionary with all the best minds stepping up to do their part to improve our country! Kudos to DOGE these guys are all patriots! Thank you Brett Baier for doing this interview! / []
Thank you all so much!!! ❤ / []
😂 I had plenty of bills opened with my name as a child & I always thought to myself how horrible them people must be to let our parents do this🤣 but I did have a comeback every time my ma said I owed her for whatever cause all she done to keep a roof over our head &bla bla,…psh technically lady you should be thankful for me keepin it & the lights on / []
professor x box 😅 / []
We know who is behind the firebombs, the most evil man in the world, who supports the democrats. / []
When DOGE team completes this gigantic tasks of bringing efficiency to the government- DOGE needs to be recognized with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. / []
Those seats look very uncomfortable. I think this would look more professional in a boardroom setting. Where seats can be comfortable and discuss all these important discoveries. The set is mediocre for something that is truly important for the American people. / []
Thus is fascinating!!! Brilliant! Well done gentleman along with your whole team working with you. This is inspiring. I pray Canada and other experts would do the same with their nations. Let’s clean up our world fiscally. 🇨🇦 / []
So I'm confused .... $833m for a survey ? .... so why haven't they followed the bank account to holder and go arrest them? / []
It's really remarkable that certain departments in the government cannot pass audits but yet they are auditing taxpayers. I guess it makes it easier to launder taxpayers hard earned money if there are no checks and balances and the crooks can turn a blind eye.  We expect our government to spend our taxes wisely.  It's astonishing the level of money being laundered and wasted. / []
This team is rock solid! ❤ 🇺🇸 / []
If they are gonna give out $5000 do it and quit by talking about it hell they got the money hes rich as hell / []
I agree with Elon. Mark Kelly is a traitor. / []
I think having all of the obstacles to retiring as a gov employee is a very over looked and important factor. All these politicians become old and decrepit and having a “training program” to go thru to be able to retire is absolutely insane and no wonder these people just never get out. That NEEDS to be fixed. / []
It’s about reducing waste and enabling accountability - when the fraudsters are complaining, you did it right. / []
B happy my friend Goodness of God / []
Well what is wrong is Chuck Schumer acknowledges that all Biden Demon-rats appointed 235 judges are progressives and are aimed to stopping our President Donald Trump will preserve his legacy and Federal judges are confirmed by the senate to serve a lifetime tenure and removing a judge through impeachment requires majority vote of two-thirds of the senate meaning 67 votes and republicans control 53 seats.... So see there playing a long game and trying to be 8 steps ahead by doing this. none of it is for the American people who pay there salary's from taxes. So I say put this to a vote and let the boss decide meaning we the people and take the power back. / []
We all mock the face news. Fox is a joke and this looks like a scripted reality TV show. / ["HAHAHAHAHA WE ARE WINNING..... YOU CAN'T WRITE THIS AS A SCRIPT. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY DEMON RATS ARE SOOOOOOO UPSET THAT WE FINALLY ARE EXPOSING THE THERE TRUE COLOR'S AND THERE SLUSH FUND OR STEALING FROM US CITIZENS AND GAME OVER...... BUY POPAGANDA."]

Why, oh WHY Brett Bair?  I don't trust the guy, and don't care for him after his behavior at the presidential debate / []

*Why has no other administration done this before?* / ['BECAUSE THE DEMON RATS SLUSH FUND WOULD GO AWAY.. AND NO OTHER ADMINISTRATION WAS TRANSPARENCY IS EXPOSING THEM...']
Peasant asking ;  will the fixing be on politicians salaries n allowances  thats its huge?   Can u   cut politicians by combining 2 small states to 1 😊  thay will save billions .  Also  cut  expenses at  presidency eg  weekend trips should be on their dime ,   robots to clean up  ?  That will fire 1k workers .  .   Realy  elon   look into those  ohh   NASA too    coz so far theu used lots of money to tell us   no livable planet  and that we can be hit by astroid we can't  help  if it comes from behind the sun .   So help us God  make us great ❤ / ['Also    cut  the amount  politicians  serving once and retire with good hesltcare including  dental .  Bodyguards  etc .  This money can be used on our olders people to get  dentures n eye glasses  for all !! Not just politicians.   We love you musk']
Politicians are just criminals this is what people with common sense do…fix the system trump need to be in power for the next at least 10 years to get things to come normal again / []
These folks look very genuine, sincere. They are real heros of the countrya and patriots who care for people and country. Let them do their work. / []

Great job! Thank you, to the DOGE team!👏👏👏 / []
SO INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL for this new administration!!!!!! 🙏🌎✨❤️ / []
Elon can't code! That's how he's coming up with these ridiculous ages. They didn't bet on a Social Security specialist watching. / []

Elon talking makes my mind go numb. He stutters every second and says nothing. / []
Go DOGE! There IS real evil……. / []
Thank you elon!!! / []
I’m not sure whether to respond to this positively or negatively. Back in India, we often think we’re the ones struggling with inefficient government processes, but it seems like this is a widespread issue across democracies. While the interviewer is asking whether AI can help, Elon suggests that the first step is to bring the U.S. government up to speed before even considering AI integration. What would typically be a behind-the-scenes discussion is now playing out in front of the entire world—yet another testament to how democracy operates. No wonder the U.S. is seen as a beacon of democracy. / ["Well you are right in a sense behind the scenes but can't the people need to see this because the demon rats have just ran our once great nation to the ground but i guarantee you none of the fraudster's are hurting for money they have stolen from us. And another thing for me is how  the fu....k is the American people be  in debt from money that we were taxed on that's the kicker."]
Wow, just wow!   “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country!”  JFK!!🇺🇸👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😻 / []
Because I am overseas I want to opt out of the Medicare part b and not pay for it out of my monthly social security check but The state wants the money to continue to flow from social security check each month and I have to fill out a five-page form in order toopt out and they want ridiculous amounts of information like my passport number where am I why am I there how long will I stay Will I come back etc etc The whole system is f***** up. / []
We own a software company and all I can say as tech geeks is this is just so cool & inspiring / ["absolutely and I'm not a tech guy but I've gotten scammed and hacked and had a feeling it was our government"]
It is great that Elon and his DOGE team are working to prevent our taxes from going to a bunch of crooks. / []
I think they explained that very well / []
Unconstitutional assholes. / []
Its pretty widely known that pretty much every institutional computer system out there is using upward of 60 year old or even older systems that should have been replaced decades ago.  Doge in many ways by the sounds of it is just upgrading these systems to something more modern and thus more secure and easier to manage and control. / []
Patriots / []
I want a truck stop buffet  back. Must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
The recurring theme from these wonderful, brilliant, hard working patriots; “…thanks to President Trump”… / []

All White Men and that makes me not trust them already, besides taking money from the disabled / []

too little, too late, sounds good, will get overturned in 5 minutes as soon as big T is out of office. / []
What a disaster 🤦🏾‍♂️ / []
Ohhh, Elon looks tired.  That poor guy.  Trump does too (based on pictures and videos I have seen in the last month or so).  I wish people understood better what needs to be done, and why.  For goodness sakes, only an idiot, or person with their head in the sand would not understand / []
One of the biggest threats is scammers. America has to protect its citizens from scammers and cyber threats. All of our money and property is under attack 365 because our lives are so easily taken advantage of from cyber and scammer threats. We need better protection. / []

I always wanted a brave man to call out big government.  Thank u Elon. / []
Governments have been robbing their people blind for years. US national debt is like 36 TRILLION!! ...not hard to see that something wasn't right.  I can't see how people would have a problem with their Government auditing themselves in such a transparent way.  Every country should have their own DOGE team but unfortunately that wouldn't be in their interest. / []
The fake news are saying those who illegally geting the social security money are now not getting it and that is the reason they claim it crash and not geting money...those are robbers. / []
It is mind blowing how much Elon can get done very quickly. Theres a saying if you want to get something done give it too a busy Man. He is the richest Man in the World yet he is prepared to do this thankless task amazing. I hope he gets rewarded. He is a massive inspiration on how to get a head in life and never give up. / []
Yall are naive and brainwashed FOOLS / []
Great news But the pentagon keeps failing its budget It will be the same thing come next year / []

Love it! I stand behind Trump and Musk. I have dreamed of this for a very long time. Finally putting an end to some of the corruption in the government. / []
So what was that crying/wailing sound at the end of the interview?I'm afraid someone was retaliated against via hurting their family members?Whoever it was sounded truly  anguished. / []
Thank you DOGE!!! / []
Social Security and the IRS are NOT connected. FYI Earnings are a mess!!! / []
I hope that the final goal is to present each American with their own interface where they can check much they paid in taxes over the  years, what they will owe this year so far, and how much Social Security they have accumulated. With today's IT soft ware this is very plausible to do. / []
Sounds about white / []

LETS SAY ALL OF THESE THINGS IN VERY SIMPLE EASY TO UNDERSTAND GENERAL PUBLIC WORDS!!!!!!   THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WORKING WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE BEEN GIVING AWAY TAX PAYER MONEY TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE AND PLACES, ( AND GETTING PAID MONEY BACK FROM ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE AND PLACES )  SO ITS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE!  THESE FEDERAL WORKERS HAVE BEEN GETTING A TAX PAYER FEDERAL PAY CHECK! FOR LITERALLY CONSPIRING TO GIVE AWAY ALL KINDS OF TAX PAYER GOVERNMENT MONEY TO OTHER CRIMINALS, AND GETTING PAID BACK BY ALL THOSE CRIMINALS FOR GIVING THEM THE GOVERNMENTS MONEY!!!!!!    : /      ELON AND HIS TEAM ARE EXPOSING, FIRING, AND TAKING STOCK AND CONTROL OF ALL THE TAX PAYER MONEY ( WHICH IS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT GETS ALL ITS MONEY )   WE THE PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE OF OUR COUNTRY, AMERICA!  BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT!  AND THE MAIN REASON WE ARE NOT?  IS BECAUSE ELECTIONS ARE TAKEN AND STOLEN, AND WE ARE ALL KEPT DIVIDED AND FORCED TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH OUR OWN PERSONAL SITUATIONS AND PROBLEMS AND COSTS OF LIVING, AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH ALL THAT EVERY DAY.. THAT WE CANT POSSIBLY STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT, GOING ON WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT!  WHICH LEAVES ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO WORK DIRECTLY IN GOVERNMENTS TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO!    : /     AND THEY HAVE ALL CREATED AND HAVE PROTECTED THE "SWAMP" THAT HAS BECOME AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS!   AND PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP,  IS TRYING TO AND IS IN FACT,  CHANGING ALL THAT!!!!  HE IS DRAINING THE SWAMP!!!!!!  AND ITS ONLY BEEN 2 MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY AND LEADERSHIP!!!!!!   : )    CANT WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE DOES AS HE CONTINUES!!   GREAT JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!!   BUT WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE?  PLEASE MAKE SURE TO TELL ATTORNEY PAM BONDI  TO LET ALL THE STATES GOVERNORS KNOW, THAT EVERY STATE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE, RESPECT, SUPPORT, ABIDE BY, PROTECT, AND ENFORCE, THE US CONSTITUTION, AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS FOR ALL THE CITIZENS OF EVERY STATE IN THE UNION!!!!  THE RULE OF LAW IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  ALL OF THESE THINGS BEING DONE IN WASHINGTON , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AROUND THE WORLD,  ARE GREAT!   BUT AMERICA NEEDS FUNDAMENTAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT HERE IN ALL OF THE STATES WHERE ALL AMERICANS LIVE!   THE LARGE NUMBERS OF VIOLENT CRIME, AND ALL KINDS OF CRIME IN GENERAL ARE ONLY GETTING MORE OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE IN MOST STATES, THE STATE GOVERNOR AND THE REST OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT RESPECTING, SUPPORTING, ABIDING BY OR ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PEOPLE.. OR SPECIFICALLY THE 2nd AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DEFEND AND PROTECT OURSELVES FROM EACH OTHER!!!!!!  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!  WHEN THIS RIGHT IS ENFORCED? AND ALL THE PEOPLE CAN DEFEND AND PROTECT THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER WHEN NECESSARY???  THIS WILL SAVE A LOT OF GOOD LIVES, END A LOT OF BAD LIVES, AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE ALL THE VIOLENT AND OTHER CRIMES IN THAT STATE!!!!!   SO PLEASE MAKE ALL THE GOVERNORS AWARE THAT IF THEY DO NOT START ENFORCING THE CONSTITUTION IN THEIR STATE?????  THEY WILL BE CHARGED AND PROSECUTED FOR TYRANNY AND NOT ABIDING BY, AND VIOLATING THE PEOPLES CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS!!!!!    THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP! / []

My question is, is DOJ going after those fraudsters and make them accountable for their crimes? / ['Sounds like the next logical step. Probably with a new team after 130 days.', "Being that most are probably wealthy/well-connected class?

Those who have even remotely tried to point out flaws in these mega systems tended to vanish in the past.

The why the F do you dance around with a chain saw like a jerk? No wonder you have no credibility. Be at least apologetic to good people that did work for the government you are firing, none of this their fault. Fix broken systems? Great, confront deniers with facts if you can get the right. And quit proceeding like a bull in a china shop. Your bias is clear and shows you as a putz. There is a radical left, but most of us are on neither side. Trump lies like breathing and you defend him, but attack others? You are not fit to tie Kelly’s shoes, what a twerp attacking him because you disagree in a viewpoint,  so now he is the enemy? On Ukraine, you ask why people dying, for what? You don’t know? Pretty clear to everyone, but not you apparently, dumbass. Your tweaks are vindictive BS sound like a child, and you dare complain about the radical left? You have brought the hate on yourself and therefore deserve it. Maybe you should figure out why your fortune is obscene, most of us think there is something in between oligarchy and communism, but you can’t even imagine it. / []

Computers can't talk to each other? That was found out and stopped years ago. / []
Let's go DOGE!  But, at the end of this video, I didn't like some things I was hearing in terms of going after the ppl inciting violence against Tesla. If they broke laws, then put them in jail.

Do not go to war emotionally charged or with ideology go with the  lives of others lesser than you, if you cannot then cheers or praise will be judged by time that no god, not lord or shepherd all for time to see.  Seeing is believing hearing is bought. / []
Awesome, thanks to the Crew! Go Elon grateful for you ❤️ / []
Also, you don't collect unemployment.  Bundents of jobs... / []
2008 is around the time Obama started getting richer than his presidential salary. / []
Thank you so much DOGE, Elon, & the many others working behind the scenes to save America. The vast majority of us support you in  this revolution. 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
People don't like change. They will kick and scream. Just part of it but it is necessary to get this done quickly and efficiently. / []
Thank you Team DOGE!💯🇺🇸🇺🇸! / []
I love Musk passion to do what is good. / []
For someone so intelligent, Elon Musk has a lot of compassion, common sense and speaks well in a way that everyone can understand. / []
Praise God for Elon Musk . May God draw Elon to His mercy seat . 🙏🏼🪖 / []
Like trump said, Elon let the others speak / []
How exciting for our future ❤ / []
Keep doing this!! America needs the Information. I hope everyone watches this, and you do another interview periodically. It will Shut down the naysayers / []
Keep it up guys, actually I pay tax to ensure you all are paid well to do this!! We all know it needs to be done, hopefully it's not to late. / []
Why don't you just balance the budget, that will save you 2.5 trillion in debt right there / []
I am SO proud of the DOGE panel of American Patriots that are willing to help make America great again! Thank you Elon and we are keeping you in our prayers daily ♥️🙏🇺🇸 / []
Let’s goo more money in America 🔥🔥 / []
May G_D bless the members of DOGE. It is mind boggling finding out how inefficient is the government. As much as this hurts - the objectives of DOGE needs to happened. / []
Best interview and information I’ve seen this week. Everyone should be forced to honestly watch it. / []
The democrats would never have sat there and answered all these questions.... Pure transparency at its finest👏👏👏👏👏👏 / []
It would be a true honor for me to shake the hand of not only Trump, but Elon and the DOGE team members. / []
Democrats want to keep social security fraudulent. / []
What about the national parks? Not a good cut. Correct that one immediately Elon Musk. You need some real people who know what normal people not just tech nerds need and want. Why the rush ? For your schedule and ego? I'm for select cutting not clear cutting. You have no idea the way these massive cuts affect our common Americans. / []
Thsts good. / []
Let's go! Good job Elon!!! / []
Keep it up please. After a long time ensure that America is great again. / []
Notice they never talked about Elon contracts. / []
Obviously it’s kept as paper files to protect the information from being deleted or fired or simply lost💡 duh / []
You end social security.  Tea party. / []
Thank you Elon, your team and President Trump for all the hard work you are doing. America needs you worse now than ever. Keep up the good work. God bless you all and keep you safe. Praying that God protects you all and shows you where to look for corruption and for the right answers. I love you all and I’m proud to be an American. / []
Love this important meeting i need some relief god knows how much these clowns use .whst os 20 percent. / []
The main stream media has propagandized the American people to hate Elon so much that they could not see or hear any truth. They are blinded by their own hate. I could hear them now hating this team based on the color of their skin and decency. Gods word says that in the end good will be evil and evil will be good. / []
This is Exactly what the country needs!  Who would be against this?  And why? / []
promises made, promises kept. America 1st! / []
Soooo where's that doge dividend for the peeps ? / []
Our country should have the best of everything. Every American should have everything they need to live comfortably. We all bust our backs and it only gets worse. Not know more. We have a real chance to get going in the right direction. We all want to get really far away from the left. Lets go America 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
Elon moving in time  a rate that is undetectable  wink of a eye *trek TOS buzz sounds / []
Awful / []
BLACK BUDGET NOW / []
Strong ending about people who virtue signal without a solution. / []
After watching this you understand just how dishonest the left is. Either that or they're just plain stupid. / []
Thank you all, guys! / []
I’m INSPIRED by this gentleman doing what is right. ❤ God BLESS Musk and everyone helping the American people. DEMOCRATS POLITICIANS ARE EVIL, WITH SOME VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS. / []
Correct.  I agree / []
We need a DOGE version in Nigeria! / []
You are an idiot if you believe these idiots. / []
I think Elon is a different man than he was a year ago he is at war right now / []
He is the carnival barker and his team are the clowns / []
Thank You Mr Musk & DOGE team.  You folks are true American patriots and we LOVE you so much! / []
They have the option.i wish i had some nerd  friends   .lol .lol.. just joking / []
God Bless DOGE. Truth be told,  you haven't even scratched the surface yet. / []
YOU GOTTA LOVE ELON MUSK….HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS!!💪🏻🇺🇸 / []
How can anyone hate on Elon?? / []
Millions of people would be employed if the billionaires paid taxes. / []
How does this work with tax cuts? / []
Elon and his Team are Amazing American Heros, Thank God for them! / []
What sort of dos in the back ground? / []
The funny thing is that almost every single person in that room was or maybe even is a democrat. DOGE is the only current effort that should have full bipartisan support. / []
What great interview / []
This is such a good example for other countries in the world. Time to clean up and be and be good. / []
Busted, so glad they were arrogant enough to do this. / []
DOGE needs to look at procurement pricing for the government. We veterans who worked in Logistics always brought up the fact the government is getting ripped off by paying higher prices for something. Example: A small piece of rubber hose costing $.80 (cents) at Home Depot, yet the military was charged $100. (dollars) for the same piece. 🙈🙉🙊 / []
To the DOGE team keep up the good work 👏 / []
Awesome interview.  Give us more!!! / []
Thank goodness y'all finally (or just thank you lol) are taking the messaging straight to the public so that the MSM narrative twisters can't keep lying. The lie machine is working so hard lately it must be starting to smoke and get hot, and chugging, sparking, maybe lighting on fire... Yet the dang thing just keeps pumping out lies about Doge.  So great the explanations are real life, normal-people speak, ... Doge has bent over backwards to be transparent and yet still the lies. If y'all kept doing this sorry of sit down, it would help, I'd think, so very much / []
Jail for Abrams. I smell a rat! / []
We want arrests.  And they need to look into bill gates chemical cloud seeding with us tax payer money now that we know climate charge was a hoax... / []
No way govt could switch over alone. They would be like that train boondogle that is over time and over budget. They call it the train to nowhere. / []
The darkness is scared of light, they are freaking out. That’s simple / []
Didn’t congress vote for every single payment contract that our taxes pay out?!?!? So y did they vote yes on such ridiculous things? / []
This is what you call civic duty. It’s what is supposed to be there as far as politicians go . Have regular jobs and put them on hold for the country then go back to your jobs. And a thanks should be in order. Thanks DOGE / []
That is why the Ameria is the greatest country in the world, because we have those people. / []
Thank you 🙏🏻. NO WHERE ENOUGH to say THANK YOU but sincerely 🙏🏻. / []
Why would anyone be against this / ['This is really just a cover up for all the things they’ll be taking away from Americans.']
15:40....just noticed for the first time, yesterday, in 10 years my wife's S.S. has not been deposited at the same time as mine into our joint account. Two days ago. No deposit at all! Obviously I'll be at their offices  today. / []
Great team / []
Thank God for DOGE and Donald Trump for working hard to save America and exposing the wasteful, fraudulent spending.  Praying for a  successful outcome and for all of your safety. 🙏 / []
A billion dollars to a survey that I can make for free?? / []
Patriot ❤ / []
Can’t wait for them to get into the Pentagon! / ['100%']
bunch of billionairs trying to get richer and dumb republican americans cant see it / []
Did you hear Europe along with Google have changed their whole story about the climate hoax.  Now they are saying human beings and cars only contribute 4 percent carbon and therefore have nothing to do with weather or storms because they are no longer able to funnel money for it from the US tax payer.  They lied to the whole world to make a few rich.. / []
So the Social Security site crashed because democrat's lies and fear mongering had people swamping the website. / []
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart and soul!!  I pray God's blessing on you all in YESHUA'S NAME AMEN  for all your sacrifices and pray for your protection always❤ / []
👎  So they are going to digitize 400,000,000,000 pages of retirement paperwork in days?   Clearly a lie.  If you digitize, has to be done manually of course to digitize one page at a time, it will take 4,000 days if you digitize 100 thousand pages a day!   That's a Billionaire speaking by the way, and how much money will they charge the Government to do that?    They will probably just go in and burn up paperwork by the tons. / []
What Musk is saying is 100% true. Most Democrat voters get their information from far left corporate media. That is the problem. They are unable or unwilling to accept that it is corrupt. / []
i LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
All of these dems spreading misinformation about doge are thieves! It’s clear. / []
Every member of the DOGE TEAM is an American hero. / []
I’m INSPIRED by this gentleman doing what is right. ❤ God BLESS Musk and everyone helping the American people. / []
❤❤Elon Musk will go down in history as one   of the main players who helped save America in this second revolution ❤❤❤ / []
TLDR:  I’d rather listen to the richest man in the world then a bunch of bureaucrats   Goodnight yall! Great interview / []
Thank you for your service, DOGE. / []
Thank you Elon Musk! / []
This is specific , planned and straightforward strategically organised. And achievable , within 130 days . Just mind blowing / []
NOTHING WRONG WITH MR. MUSK HOLDING HIS  SON AND CONSOLING HIM WHILE IN THE INTERVIEW...NOT AT ALL...HE IS A CHILD AND THAT IS HIS FATHER. PRACTICE AT HOME DOING INTERVIEWS SO HE CAN HAVE EVERY CHILD OF HIS KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM BEING ON CAMERA AND  THEY WAIT FOR HIM.XO LIKE A SCRIPT AND MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE WITH THIS ACTIVITY / []
The great indepth study! Seeing some real Patriots at work / []
Thank you gentlemen, for the outstanding service you are providing our country. When someone already has an abundant life and still makes the decision to provide a selfless service, that speaks truth to their character. Your sacrifice and dedication is very well noticed and much appreciated. / []
Patriots. / []
❤ amen to all these men and woman helping the system get true and honest  in America ❤ Australia needs the same overhaul ❤ / []
Musk is such a patriot and I am thrilled he’s dedicated to making our country a better place. Thank you Elon Musk! / []
We should talk about the prevailing reaction to Signalgate – utter disbelief. People who know something about national security, military affairs, government secrets and federal law appear to be stunned by the clowns, idiots and buffoons who “accidentally texted” the classified planning of airstrikes on Yemeni Houthis to the editor of The Atlantic. / ['we’re talking about doge here though, nobody cares about the text, it was a mistake it won’t happen again and now we’ve moved on 👍']
Very good / []
The biggest blessing for America in this generation has to be Trump and DOGE / []
I've been trying to contact the State departments and the Congress Department pleasing for HELP we are truly SUFFERED truly NO INCOME at all 5 years truly Disabled truly HOMELESS please 🙏🙏🙏 / []
Go go go! / []
These men saved America , national treasures / []
I will die working labor in America .  fact jack / ['Never mind the social media .']
LOL you think we are going to watch Elon talking to the Trump slaves? HAHAHAHA / ['yes']
Democrats already know this lol they are gaslighting us hoping we bow down. / []
Those were back up files before computers. They were in storage. / []
Can we see the full non edited version? / []
GO DOGE  👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯 / []
AVENGERS ASSEMBLE / []
Please let all those men that more Americans are thankful for what they're doing than aren't. It really hurts my heart for Elon.  Just because he's a genius doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings. I can see the hurt in his face for what these people are doing to him. / []
Elon is going to make SSA private and going to benefit from it. He will add AI for workers / []
How much of that money from 15 million people over the age of 120 is being funneled into the CIA & Military black ops budget.  🤔 / []
They are literally saving the country / []
ELON MUSK HAS MADE ALL HIS WEALTH FROM "HUMAN BEINGS" BUT HE WORSHIPS TECHNOLOGY. GIVE THE PEOPLE SOME OF YOUR WEALTH INSTEAD OF TRYING TO REPLACE THEM WITH TECHNOLOGY AND MAYBE THEYLL STOP BURNING YOUR SH!T DOWN. YOURE NOT TRYING TO HELP SH!T / ['lol calm down']
I thank everyone putting their own lives aside to help DOGE save our country. God bless you all. / []
Share this link guys ! / []
This had to be done. I'm guessing the people who are worried and fighting this have no idea how bad their lives would be under a government that defaults on their debt. / []
"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds."  ~ Albert Einstein~  Thank you, Mr. Musk! We see you. / []
Beware of wolfs in sheep's clothing / ['how much transparency do you need 🤦']
At 36 minutes and 40 seconds they asked about someone being a decorated veteran. The answer should’ve been so is Benedict Arnold / []
Elon Musk is the Einstein of our generation. / []
THIS IS MICHELLE: IF EVERYONE WOULD JUST STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SAYING!!!!! I / []
This has far less views than it should. Start sharing folks! / []
Get off paper. Digitize everything. Turn all the credit cards off. Taxpayers should have a say so in what is paid. It's that, or abolish income tax. I'd prefer the latter. It'll go right back to corruption after Trump leaves. / []
Just imagine if these unaccounted and stolen funds, worth billions of dollars, are to be used toward  funding the _SPECIAL OPS_ of these insidious intelligence agencies and its tentacles.   For example, hiring local terrorists to create small fires and incite national hysteria: a PR move to take away the power from the Trump Administration who seemed to be going against the agenda of these narcissistic monsters. / []
No / []
Thank God for Donald Trump / []
Fed gov under Democrat leaders were pushing for tech scholarships  and jobs etc and they don't want employees to use it is  very Suspicious!!! / []
You guys rock, Elon, dont stop and We Love you man! / []
The feds have been stealing my money!!!!  GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY NOW!!!! / []
Go Team Doge! Stop the thieves! / []
Vietnam and many other countries in Asia follow Elon's footstep. We are blessed to have Elon and those men in DOGE team. May God bless them abundantly and protect them all. / ['North Korea as well']
Sound like slavery to me 🤣🤣🤣🤣 set me free brother 🤣 / []
They are doing a great job / []
Unbelievable, you would think a superpower like America would not have such problems in such a magnitude. Thank you, Donald Trump for selecting such genius like Elon Musk to be ahead of this project. All Americans should be grateful that this group of people are involved in helping America. Instead of burning Elon musk cars they should tank him for what he’s doing , shame. / ['Genius hahaha the poorly educated really are easy']
Thank you President Trump, Elon and the rest of you gentlemen for all of your dedication, time and sacrifice for all of the work you are doing on DOGE,. / []
DOGE team patriot duty to audit our federal government is for our children’s future livelihoods and peace of mind. 🙏 Thank you so much DOGE team! / []
The Democrats keep complaining that it’s Elon Musk and a lot of 19 year olds, none of the people on this panel. Looks like they’re 19 years old. They look older no offense guys. However, I do know that working for the government because I did it for 15 years, doesn’t make you look older.   Thank God you’re doing what you’re doing. You’re saving us money. / []
I know i never ised any of this money  so thats a relief. / []
Unbelievable, you would think a superpower like America would not have such problems in such a magnitude. Thank you, Donald Trump for selecting such genius like Elon Musk to be ahead of this project.

Is it a good idea to use some of this money for the marine life Such as helping out animals  that live in water by providing equipment that cleans contaminated water  thst are hazardous for animals and humans.examples : oil spulls ,water contamination of any kind ..nuclear  waste ,trash that contaminates and is hazardous for animals .etc.   also only if its a good idea wayer plants because its less contamination to filter drinkable water  i know its salt waters but elon is a genius ,hes new invention of using wayer on vehicles was remarkable abd i had thst idea cross my mind years ago  But it wasbonly an idea that caught my sttention when he invented this vehicles running on water.  Water has hundreds of many more uses if elon starts using it on equipment that can help us in many forms.guys thank you very much for your time. Im in depth with you all. / []
Clearly this is what fascist tyrants look like: normal people working out in the open to fix corruption for no personal gain. / []

I knew someone who retired   from the fed about 12 years ago. After retirement he received a letter from the government informing him he would begin receiving his retirement pension in approximately 18 months. In the meantime, he would receive $2,000 every month as a stopgap Pay. Fortunately the guy was able to find another job very soon. Otherwise he and his family would be starving very soon. / ['And he also told me that his pension suffered a deduction because he would receive social security payment because he paid into it before he joined the Feds. He thought it was highway robbery.']

If they keep up the pace theyve been going ,within 4 years this countrys debt should be on the right path. That is if Democrats and crooked judges will leave them alone. DOGE and TEAM TRUMP ROCKS! ❤ / []
Is Elon Musk todays Ben Franklin?? / []
Am still confuse as to y people have a problem with DOGE. We all live on some form of a budget we all kno what happens when u blow money out. Y we even debating this counrties goes bankrupt all the time US going backrupt will be a disastrous time believe me. / []

Democrats blaming doge for social security website crashes shows how clueless  they are. Social Security offers the "opportunity" to go paperless. When you choose that option, you quit receiving any paper copies. I made the grave error of choosing that option 6 years ago. I have never, in six years, been able to access the website because of some glitch. And I can't go back to paper without website access. I pray constantly that nothing goes wrong... / []

Brett beer saying why why go against why calling someone a traitor when in fact they are unbelievable. Elon musk is a real person. He's a brilliant genius. No question about that but he's honest and if someone's a traitor they should be called a traitor. We got communism going on here in a big way with that fake news.

Big difference from the you gotta sign it to read it mentality / []
Idk. It seems to me Brett smells BS. / []
Start with South Africa first then let us hire you. Nobody votes for this and you can’t be trusted / ['Why not? I trust him hundred percent. He has delivered on all his promises, yes sometimes there are delays, but he always delivers. All those folks around Elon are impressive as well!', '@ I feel really sorry for people like you. You really don’t get it. But they bet on that ignorance. He hasn’t delivered anything. That man is the richest man in the world. If he wanted to help people he could’ve been doing so with his own fortune long ago. People like that don’t change their colors. You don’t have to tear others down to improve anything. They could completely create a new system and systematically implement changes slowly that don’t affect the American people and the entire structure of the country that has been built for hundreds of years. Nothing this “magnificent” happens over night. Elon’s wealth depends on several government contracts that’s he has had for many years and many more that he’s gained by being apart of this administration. If you truly think he has anyone’s best interest at heart you gotta sit down with yourself. Harming veterans department of Ed Medicaid Medicare. You don’t help people by hurting them. It makes no sense and there’s no reason for people with this amount of money to do such things unless it’s ultimately going to benefit them.']
GOD BLESS ELON AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. MAGA. DOGE EVERY MEMBER IN THE AMERICAN  CONGRESS AND THE SENATE. / []

We must continue to pray over these men and ask that their actions be guided by God. I hope we will discontinue these proxy wars in the middle east and the east soon. Too many people are dying. Too many people are lying, and creating false, horrible narratives that drive young productive men and women to their early deathbeds all across the world.

Hand me the mic, and I'll make Elon sweat and squeal in his chair like the fraudster pig he is.  Why these soft questions? Americans want to know what is being done with their data.

A Word of Caution to Musk Fans: Progress Must Not Come at the Cost of Humanity  I was once an ardent supporter of Elon Musk—a visionary who pushed technology forward like no other. But over time, the cracks in the narrative became impossible to ignore.  The promise of free speech on X turned out to be an illusion, with Musk himself suppressing criticism while artificially amplifying his own voice. Worse, his political shift toward far-right extremism, racist rhetoric, and outright fascist sympathies revealed a disturbing side of his leadership.  What truly alarms me, however, is his reckless, sledgehammer approach to power. His cozy relationship with Putin’s Russia, his willingness to cut off Starlink access for Ukrainians in their fight for survival—these are not the actions of a principled innovator, but of a bully with little regard for the vulnerable.  Technological advancement should never come at the expense of democracy, equality, or basic human decency. As fans of progress, we must demand better—because unchecked power in the hands of any one individual is a danger to us all. / []
this will go down the history. / []

I work with Apple software programs at work and the mouse's arrow, moves from side to side all on it's own, where at times it feels like I have to fight it off to make it stop misbehaving and make it do what I'm commanding it to do. Then I think there have to be hackers on the line. Daily work inputted, deletes itself but I'm thinking it is being caused by a co-worker that wears a black baseball cap all day long, every day of the week, like to let others who visit the office know which organization he belongs to. Idk. I have a hunch about the whole thing, but I can't figure out the reasons behind their sick games. I think the internet, FB should be reset, and allow 2 profiles per account. FB should delete all of people 's accounts and do a worldwide reset. / []

How can they get loans? Is GOV in the business of giving loans? Only Fannie Mae and Freddi Mac are in giving mortgage loans, which are private and only backed by gov. They do a thorough check.

Let me put it in plain english for you. Yes there is wasteful spending in the governement. It is a literal DROP in the sea compared to the tax 'efficiency' strategies that exist for billionaires. top 5% earners taxed at 90% for 2 years would completely clear the national debt. Imagine 3 years. You would have free education and healthcare. But no. You have to fire everyone and increase unemployment. lmao. / []

Every American needs to watch this video.  This special Report of behind the scenes  of what DOGE is doing behind the scenes.

Listen to who these people speaking are and their  titles JUST TO BRING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH and there a lot of them who Don't deserve it .  If this is you suck it up and own it. There are billionaire s sitting here offering to help fix the issue.  The two I would say everyone pay & pay attention to is the CFO of the Treasury and what he admits. Also pay attention to the discussion of where all Social Security is kept and handled. / []

I’m at 10:39 where they are talking about social security… I’m going to be 60 soon and for as long as I can remember the democrats have been saying the republicans want to eliminate social security. All I can say is if this were really true they would have succeeded by now! So to the younger people out there ask someone that you trust who is over say 55 this question: If they are democrats: How long have the republicans been trying to eliminate social security?  If they are a republicans: How long have the democrats been saying the republicans are trying to eliminate Social Security? If they pause to think about it either party will probably say something like: “As long as I can remember!” Folks that’s how long you have been lied to by politicians from both sides! But I will say the democrats really suck at it right now! 😂 / []
My friend took the voluntary  retirement and is really happy about it. It is really generous in terms of payout, salary for 8 months and benefits.

The anti-Musk propaganda is coming from the mainstream media largely owned by people whose income streams have been massively impacted by Musk's transitional businesses. Some, like legacy aerospace owned by the military/industrial complex, to the point of redundancy. They don't like him and are talking a lot of people into hating him too. BTW, the front lines in Ukraine are no longer static.

Where she lives and works is a facility in northwest Iowa. My husband asked the director what the turnover rate was and he said 10%. She’s lived in the one waiver home for 18 years and there are 4 original staff. The Village is celebrating 50 years being open.  My son has worked hard in finance Dept. and has paid taxes all his life so I know he understood more of this broken - fraudulent system better than I did.

Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected as CA governor to "Clean House".  But he never did.   So now Californians inherited a very bloated government who's only means to "fill" in the ever growing budget is by raising taxes, fees and looking for new ways to create new forms of taxes that never existed before.  Like the Mansion tax, net worth tax, exit tax..  But when in reality CA need to make government more efficient and be more realistic about raises that compound the budget in unsustainable ways and contracts with no budget end in site like the state high speed rail that never finishes.  But.  There is hope.  When Trump called for federal workers to return back to the office.  So did Newsom who also call state workers back to the office.  Musk had to exit CA because all these taxes were creeping in.  In the end, it's the people who has to pay.  For inefficient ways. / []

Here's an idea DOGE. You are talking about creating good experiences. Put a search function on your website.  Where is the MONEY coming from to create all these NEW systems replacing the OLD systems? Old mine containing retirement records. Who is digitizing the old records? Who is building the database? Where is that MONEY coming from? Who is getting the contracts to do this work? Is DOGE doing all that work? You have engineers working on the problems. Where is the MONEY coming from to pay them? Who is paying the testers testing the migration of the data. Lots of databases aren't talking to each other? Where is the project, and what COSTS are involved in merging all these systems? Is anyone checking that the work being done is actually correct? Who is paying them? You have already made mistakes on your DOGE website that you delete - completely erase rather than show as incorrect. That seems deceptive. / []

Thank you from the tax payers for all that you’ve done on our behalf! / []
He said 4B a Day 7 Days A Week, and So far We ARE SUCCEEDiNg!! Just elaborate please tell us more about it 💭 / []
Stumbling over his words. Elon is a clown 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 / []
How Am I supposed to know when they said they are from the Social security department and asked for my SSN. I am truly Disabled seen by the specialist and NO INCOME at all 5 years and I have a minor SO UNFAIR I am the MISINFORMATION please 🙏🙏🙏 / []
Everyone buy a Doge hats or Doge T-shirt and the Trump team wins again!!!! Sorry if you don’t like my statement!!!!💪🇺🇸 / []
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻bravo Elon / []
And democrats want you to think these men want to steal your money and identity…. / []
Paperwork is often better. INTERNET AND DIGITAL CAN AND DOES GO MISSING! NOT SAFE FOR US PEONS WHO MUST PROVE WE FILLED SOMETHING OUT!!! / []
Wow you really can't teach old dogs new tricks better not worse so hard to believe / []
The radical media,  MSNDC,  CBS,  ABC,  and Communist CNN won't cover this. / []
Beautiful to see / []
I guess only time can tell, how many people were affected. / []
How do people not see this truth? Mind boggling. Thank you Doge team. You are heroes ❤ / []
It's frustrating to see the protests over Elon Musk. He should be lauded for all he's doing for this country.  When it's all said and done, there should be a monument erected for all he's accomplished. / []
Why they all talk the same way ? / []
Ayee I Love everything they are doing but this is the second time Elon has said “9 month year old” 😂😂 / []
I hope all Dem supporters see this.   Politicians opposed to cleaning up government systems and balance sheets are the one's benefiting from all the flaws. / []
Elons word: “we should focus on the interest of the United States above any other country” what about Israel? Is that about other countries ? Or what do you mean Elon? / ['Israel is in our interest', '@ develop a bit more..']
This is absolutely amazing!!!Thank you for doing this job. It’s soooo long overdue. The hope for the better future has been born 💙❤️🇺🇸 / []
Keep charging ahead DOGE Team! Go Elon! 🇺🇸👍❤️ / []
MUSIC to my ears. THANK YOU, DOGE. God bless you! / []
Thank you President Musk. You bought that office. Trump just sitting. having no idea what is going on. / []
DOGE Haters need to realize that if the United States goes bankrupt we all go down. Who’s gonna save us then? Thank you Elon and DOGE crew. / []
Then match the social security numbers to who voted for Joe Biden / []
The fact DOGE exists is so sureal. We've neededvthis for so long. Sometimes it just seems unreal. Amazing, finally going to look into our buget. So amazed and glad. Just don't take social security or any programs for low income and elderly people! Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, Section 8, Snap etc. These things we needbto keep. Find more dirty money! / []
Thank you for everything you are doing.  I don’t think I’m alone in saying that I had lost hope of ever seeing this kind of change in our country and government.  Praying for your protection and success.  Again, so very grateful! / []
What a team!!!!! / []
Go Elon make America free again / []
Wait why do the people that want paper ballots only all of a sudden want everything to be digitized? The left has been talking about this for DECADES / ['It truly is funny how people like you think you\'re so clever with statements like that but don\'t realize you\'re severely low iq. You actually thought you "got em!" with that stupid statement.']
Any of the lawmakers attacking the Doge team must be involved in some of the wrongdoing being uncovered by Doge. They too must be investigated. / []
Is this little cutie the "secretary dog" from Youtube shorts? / []
Alien Man Musk is fixing America. 🇺🇸 👽 🚀 / []
TRUMP 🇺🇸MAGA🇺🇸Elon 🇺🇸 DOGE 🇺🇸 / []
You know I almost want to believe Elon! The rest of the bunch I don't know about!! / []
Liar / []
He's like the opposite of doctor evil😂 / []
One of the politicians that have been tied to age discrepancies in their atmosphere was Barack Obama when he had dead people voting for him and his own social security number from someone born in the 1800s / []
Why this stupid new reporter posting this stuff on media the enemies is watching and studying from all this. / []
America is back on track🇺🇸 / []
THANK GOD THE GUYS OF DOGE ARE ON THE JOB!!   LOVE YOU ALL!!!YOU ARE MAKING A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
What a good program written and a good computer. One computer can replace. Probably 90% of these government employees that are just literally where our money's getting stolen just ripped off. It's disgusting and that's what they discovered. That's why the Democrats are all upset. They're caught with their pants down / []
It shouldn’t be too much to ask that government follow their own rules they force everyone else to follow. / []
great job Doge..... Thank you.. / []
People who are against Elon and the DOGE team are Ignorant. They have done 0 research or there so liberal that the rage won’t allow them to see the Truth! They should create a cure for liberal rage! / ['you are the ignorant, brainwashed person with 0 research lol You are full of fascist rage and hate for marginalized groups', '@nikhilp2351 You being sarcastic?']
Thank you SO VERY MUCH to Elon and the DOGE team! / []
No wonder hes being harmed. The bad guys dont like them / []
All words im waiting for results and i want them now! Why is he so slow and why does he need to pay for votes / []
🇺🇸 Thank You 🇺🇸 Elon 🇺🇸  / []
Before looking at any comments, I stopped the video and sent a text to my sister and brother-in-law that EVERY, SINGLE , PERSON, IN THIS COUNTRY, should watch this. Period. / []
We've been butchered ,we don't even know..what the heck Jeff Beck.!!.Thanks President Donald Trump Administration..Thanks Elon Musk DODGE team...GOD BLESS YOU ALL...PRAYERS EVERY DAY FOR ALL OF YOU..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ / []
Billionaires won, democracy is being Julius Caesar'd / ["When was the last time billionaires didn't have an influence in democracy? Lobbyists, super packs and Large corporations etc", "@RichardSandoval-f6b right but this is the deepest they have slithered in. In this video three of the guests that I know of are billionaires. They aren't hiding anymore. Dark money isn't dark anymore. I assume this is because they have won and no longer have to hide their ownership. They are right here telling everyone they are in all the governments critical systems and they can do whatever they want with no repercussions. And people are cheering them on. It's when they start touching things that directly affect people personally that everyone will snap out of it, by then it will be too late. This feels dystopian"]
Thank you! / []
How many of you hate Brad Smith voice and accent / []
American hero! God bless you Mr. Musk and your whole team 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
Love it Elon. Do more interviews to show the world the good you are doing and your passion on ending the war! God bless you! / ['@Robbibball I see Elons poison, I mean passion.', '@Robbibball wants Putin to win and closed down agencies helping Ukrainian kids Disgusting guy', 'Ending which war?']
God bless these men for putting everything on the line to do this!! / []
I appreciate this interview, finally seeing and hearing from some of the DOGE staff besides Elon and the tech youngsters and hearing some of the process. However, I still feel that a lot of public distrust and angst could have been avoided by Musk and company  by presenting their approach and plans to the WHOLE Congress, not just the GOP, before they touched any systems and entered any buildings. Seeing the tech youngsters muscle their way into buildings with US Marshalls and shut down buildings and start laying people off without any notice, and giving false reasons for firing people...which is not legal....did NOT help matters. Why does it all have to be done in 130 days?...the rushing leads to errors and adds to mistrust. Clinton balanced the budget and laid off lots of gov employees but did it by consulting with Congress and at a slower pace that was less traumatizing. Vought of OMB wrote in Project 2025 that he wanted to traumatize the federal work force....that was not a helpful stance.  Lutnick of Commerce's arrogant  statement that only fraudsters would complain about a missed Social Security payment only adds to the distrust and appearance of the Trump admin being out of touch with the average citizen. There is a cruel edge to this admins approach to their policies that seems unnecessary. / []
thats the first time ive seen Elon angry , when he talks about kids dying in the wars , getting killed for nothing / []
Democrats are hiding the fact that our taxpayer money  finances their party / []
Seems counter productive since trump promised elon 500 billion to get to mars.  Also, trump’s cabinet has proven themselves to be incompetent, if not traitors. / ['No']
The democrats will continue crying and spewing lies I refuse to listen to their bantering. This interview should be all over mainstream news outlets. / []
Wow / []
Thank yóu Elon añd your team to help president Trump save America❤ / []
政治家の顔になってきた、次期大統領 / []
Absolutely great job, Trump, Elon and team. ❤🎉 / []
You bunch of idiots watching this video! All they're going to do is remove the ones stealing now so their group can be the one that steals instead! / ["Then what's the point of complaining about it idiot?"]
Let's find out who owns the mine and the company that runs the mine you're going to see BlackRock vanguard corrupt billionaires corrupt millionaires probably a Clinton somewhere That's where they bury blackmail evidence probably even some bodies / []
Thank for for service and thank for clean corrupt people take our hard working tax money we not rich live paid  check still paid tax very year never got any thing back take and take time for American first and give back our hard working tax money / []
Great interview / []
I trust this group of highly intelligent and capable people completely!! Thank you D.O.G.E.!! These men are amazing! So captivating to hear them talk about the function of D.O.G.E. and what they are finding.  Pray for their safety!! / []
These men are going to be targeted by the crazy left. / []
God bless them and their work if it is Gods will. Amen / []
Thanks Brett Baier for bringing DOGE on air. The work and solutions they have to discover and implement are not for the faint of heart. They seem like a great team with solid, real world experience to get the government operationally and financially back on line. / []
This can't be, have NO IDEA where billions (that's billions with a "B") of dollars went!?!?!? I'll spend days finding 4¢ missing from my checking account.   💯🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏😡 / []
💪💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Very informative. Thank you DOGE!  😊❤ / []
The least TRANSPARENT thing I've ever seen - a bunch of crooks spewing BS with NOTHING to back any of it up - in a softball interview inside a fake W.H. setup.  Transparent would be a entirely separate  and independent 3rd party team "overseeing" exactly what this "Doge" crap is up to. So far Doge have not responded to the various independent analysis on the Doge website claims - where there are many many many cases of BS receipts and BS figures being touted. / []
Wow.. the blatant lies from the Democrats. Its appalling. / []
Absolutely.Nothing. But. Respect. And. Thanks. For. These. Hero. Patriots. ❤ / []
Big thank you for you all patriot. 🙏🇺🇸👍 / []
I don't know why the general media is not agreeing with you guys. How can I know you are telling the truth. / []
It makes me sick that we are talking about TRILLIONS of dollars. / []
I Want to know what you plan to do when it comes to individuals faking there  deaths to get on sochial security benefits I know of three of them along with goverment offichials that helped them get on it / ['Trump and Musk have brainwashed you to mistrust, hate and target your fellow working and middle class people while they have committed the biggest frauds to enrich themselves.']

Love what they are doing and thanks for that👏👏👍! / []
good job guys, we really need this - this is beautiful work / []
This is awesome. Great interview. This is a group of highly successful geniuses. / []
This is just another reason why Donald j. Trump and Elon musk are American heroes. They're the envy of all citizens throughout the entire world. Even in the UK, thousands of protesters chanting. We want Trump. We want Trump keep up the good work guys. We're proud of you / []
Scary to think that almost half the population will watch this and the first thing that comes to there mind is “these guys are nazis” / []
It looks like Mark Kelly cares more about the people of Ukraine than the Americans in Arizona whose welfare he swore to represent and uphold. / []

That was an all around great interview with DOGE team. Got to love educating the American people of the progress DOGE is making to make America strong again financially / []
The Dems are not used to truth ,only deception. / []
Really great interview of Elon and DOGE! God bless them for doing this! They are literally helping to save the country financially. And eliminating evil within the government. / []
Thank God for Doge! Thank you Elon! / []
Amazing group of patriots. Thank you / []
You’re either outraged by the waste and corruption of OUR 💰 or you’re benefiting by the corruption 💯‼️ / []
How about legacy media pushing the lie? / []
Fabulous interview! Wow. It is inspiring to hear the members of this team explaining what they are doing. Brilliant people working together to better America. Why in the world anyone would be complaining is truly mind-blowing. Elon Musk is a treasure and a hero. / []
These people are snake oil salespeople, they won’t change a thing regarding government waste in the United States. This group DOGE would have know understanding of how government departments work, they are sooo unprofessional. I am speaking from Australia has anyone over there heard of an independent audit with trained people who specialise in government processes, I pray for the people of the United States. Cheers / []
All the billions of dollars that they save, the American people will never see a dime. If you think any different, you're delusional. / []
The valuable job this team is doing is something hard to imagine but majority of low IQ people wont understand it / []
how about this guy neuters himself instead of producing more and more autistic children like himself to waste the world's resources. Also how about he returns all the money he has gotten as subsidies from the taxpayers. The biggest grifter in the world who has taken billions of dollars from the taxpayers is targeting small fish so he can enrich himself even more. / []
Thank you. 🙏 ❤ / []
I don’t like fox but however Elon can get the word out to people. / []
Thank God for Fox Network bringing us this information. / []
Elon looks tired. He is a Hero. Makes me sick what they are doing to his car dealerships and cars. Not to mention the pollution it adds to the environment. Trump is saving our country / ['Where is Amy Gleason?????? 😂😂😂', '😂😂😂😂', 'Great use of logic and argumentation.\n\nReason stares.', 'Let’s buy more Teslas!', "He's not tired, he's high as a kite on ketamine."]
These fellas are lying to you. / ['They are lying that our gov is ran very inefficiently and is corrupt?  😂', '@malachi-no! That part is true. But this interview had very few specifics and was rather vague. If we’re talking about DOGES specific claims about money they have saved, then yes they are lying to you.', '@ Did you hear them talk about being open and showing records?', '@malachi- I did, yes. Saying their aim is to be honest and transparent is one thing but they are either lying, obfuscating, or confused about their claims. For example, no one else (other than DOGE itself) is able to corroborate the amount they claim that they’ve saved (DOGE website says $130 billion saved as of 3/28/2025). In fact, they’ve made it harder to keep track of some government spending by removing contracts that they’ve canceled from any government website (such as the USAID contracts). Their alleged “wall of receipts” is fraught with errors such as these and they are constantly removing and adding correct/incorrect information to it. Until other sources can verify their claims, DOGE should be suspect. If you are like me and wary of corruption, waste, and mismanagement, why not apply that same sentiment to DOGE?', "@apdbr9 I do, but they have not even hardly started, you are tightening the leash and they are just now sniffing around, you seem to have a particular goal in mind, and not in their favor.\n\nAnybody that is for more Fed Gov has got issues.\n\nIt is our job to keep the gov in line, no?\n\nBut that's the problem, it has been out of control long before we were ever born.\n\nTheir whole job is to cut back on ridiculous waste and inefficiency, you would think you would be pumped about learning just how bad things are on the inside and want to help make it all even more public."]
Thank you Mr. Musk, and the Doge team. Truly a brilliant group of people. Very inspiring. ❤ / []
Seeing a fking propaganda… getting brain wash by a fking immigrant. / ['All that and you are on the govs side?😂']

Ok I'll be specific.  Mr. Musk, can you give the economists and all news media both fox and others the analysis of all the cuts and proof of savings to the American tax payers.    That has not been done.  Only your word and other politicians words that savings have occurred.    That is a specific question that you wanted asked. / []

It’s the savage tactics behind a ‘slow-down’ mission. Dialing back proven dictatorial actions is too familiar to “oops, that may have outweighing consequences against us”. / []

This all sounds well & good, hopefully it is. Too bad America had to throw almost every international relationship under the bus - this is a mistake.

If the Department of Energy (DOE) had allocated $12.79 million for Lindahl Reed’s services, but the contract was terminated early and resulted in $11.26 million in savings, it suggests there might have been underlying reasons for the cancellation. The question is whether it was worth spending that much money on Lindahl Reed, and why the contract was canceled. Here's a deeper look into these aspects: . Why Was the Contract Canceled? / []

Everyone that received money fraudulently needs to have a nice public inquiry where they can explain to the American people why they were receiving this money, who approved it, for how long and how much..and where is it now.  It needs to be brought out into the open to stop it and bring justice.  You don't get to steal a billion dollars and have no consequences! Ridiculous!  We want the names!  Thank you, Lord, for answering so many prayers to shine light on the corruption! / []
Thank you Elon! You guys are Heroes ❤ / []
This is enough to call our government  Has been corrupted / []

Very well spoken and I can see the truth in their words. It is so nice to hear them and not be angry or wise cracks nor anyone lashing out against others. / []
It's a SAD day when your government is standing there calling all of these programs that help the poor and working class/veterans, "A WASTE". *Look how many they recalled directly because they were firing from the hip*. The equality is in the trash can, our administration is meme coining and peddling merchandise. They are dodging something way way worse than Hillary's emails *which was investigated for nearly a decade*. But listen to the top 1%, that owns the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90% WHILE giving more and more and more and more cuts to that 1%... *Mind-blowing*. **Project 2025 Isn't real though** Some of these stories have already been covered, but here we are pushing it. / ['If you want to debate any of this, agree to our one rule, no fact checking...']

Elon Musk, along with the DOGE team, are American heroes & patriots. Along with, and under the direction of the greatest president since Lincoln, they are saving America and taking it back from the corrupt forces of this world, the same forces that have now almost completely destroyed Europe. God bless and protect them. / []
I hope this will serve as an example for BYROS around the world. / []
They need to put out quarterly reports, with summaries, and public access. / []
that rocket science dude speaks just like elon / []
People have been fired with about 1 hours notice.    So it sounds like DOGE Is not quite sure what is happening.    It is just completely dishonest to state otherwise publicly.    Now it is true the Federal Court system reinstated those folks against the will of the Trump Administration.    Nevertheless, it happened.     The representation of the Treasury payments system is not exactly accurate either. / []
When will the thieves that stole be arrested / []
God bless and protect you all! / []
Clear and Honest Question? How can any American be against this? / []
PayPal Mafia vibes / []
Talking and giving evidence is hardly a look inside anything theses geeks are accomplshing / []
I support  Elon and Doge with their dedication to our nation!!! / []
We LOVE ELON !🇺🇸 / []
This is the mindset need to be in congress ❤❤❤ / []
“Which line do you not agree with?” And duh, they won’t even respond to that answer. Of course they wouldn’t. The left will never agree with things that DO make sense, but disagree based off of whether you’re one party or the other. It’s nuts. Sacred tax payer moneys, we should have care for how it’s used. / []
Why are they acting like they're the first ones who discovered and are doing something about this when the GAO and inspector generals have been talking about it for years and have been ignored by Congress and fired by the President? / []
Awesome team! ❤ Keep up the good work! 🇺🇸 / []
The other Networks are in on the scamming of America. If they weren’t they would be covering Doge appropriately and not smearing them every evening on TV. / []
There should be no more criticism of doge if you have watched this video. NONE!!!! Wake up people! / []
Love these guys❤❤❤❤❤ / []

I enjoyed every minute of that interview. / []
They are draining the swamp‼️ / []
What is the worst is that Congress is supposed to be doing this. Why aren't they? Because they are the most corrupt and a huge part of the problem. There was no choice but to go outside of government for this. / []
Another piece of fake news debunked. I didn’t see one 19yr old on the DOGE team. God bless Elon and his team of like minded Patriots👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Thank you Elon Musk and DOGE team / []

Americants can't produce their own eggs they dream they can do anything they need, just saving few dollars with doge 😂😂😂😂, then they blame Mexicans about their own s 😂😂😂😂 / []
Most excellent discussion 🎉🎉🎉 / []
Democrats: Elon is a fascist! Elon: Guys, your computer systems are REALLY messed up!  Lmao / []
Why does Elon and the other doge team members do this job..... because they are called to, if not them then who!? Eventually some other people will take over but for now the need is pressing to get the job done / []
This is mind blowing the insanity in the federal government - just astonishing. / []

My God People, if you can't see the Deep State at work trying to submarine these guys you need a new set of glasses. What a wonderful system (DOGE) will be to the survival of this country. These people should get a medal. / []
Thank you, Elon!!! You are a Patriot. / []
36:45 "Somebody should care about the interests of the United States above the interests of another country.And if they don't, they're traitor" musk said . So when Trump compromises Americans' right to freedom of speech for the benefit of Israel, isn't that the very definition of treason?" / []
This is beautiful. It’s a crime that other channels won’t show it. / []
This is the best ever news post ever. Elon thanks for all you do to makethis world a better place, may GOD keep blessing and protecting you and Presidente Donald Trump. / []
THANK YOU!!! We really appreciate you Team DOGE!!!! / []
repoblicans n labour messed up this world / []
I will definitely be showing this to my Children and Grandchildren and require them to watch and listen to this.  They have no  idea how this is going to benefit them throughout their life!!!  Thank you Elon and all your Crew!!!! / ['hows that boot taste, snowflake?', 'Why would you torture your babies with this?', "As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\r\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \r\nSources:\r\nBBC World\r\nNews\r\nReuters"]
If Elon is trying to save the country money by searching for wasteful spending, then why is Trump and the republicans going to give rich Billionaires a four plus Trillion dollars Tax break??  Billionaires already make Billions yearly.  Yet raising our taxes is ok while LOWERING the billionaires' taxes??  Please someone explain to me how firing thousands of people, gutting Medicaid, and upcoming trying to privative Social Security so that Wall Street gambles Americans money away is a good idea??  Why is it that only the rich can win in this Trump administration while important programs that we the middle class and poor Americans depend on are ended or severely cut so that money is leftover for the Billionaire tax breaks.  People sell all your Tesla stocks (Stock Symbol TSLA), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (Stock Symbol DJT) stocks, and the stocks of any rich company doing business or giving money to Trump.  Ask your stockbrokers which of your stock portfolios have those two stocks TSLA and DJT and sell those stocks.  Then BOYCOTT those companies.  That is how WE get back at them for taking OUR tax dollars for themselves. / []
Usa 🇺🇸 has an enormous look to have a such great executive team to improve their government 🎉 / []
Unfortunately all the good work Musk and his team are doing goes through the window when you apply 25% tariffs to foreign imports / ['@bikal1645 Tariffs have a limited short term benefit but they end up leading to price hikes on consumer products like electronics, clothing, and even food. Examples like Argentina or Germany should be self explanatory. BTW, Elon Musk has openly expressed his concerns about tariffs']

great insight well done / []
They are robbing you all blind, open your eyes, immigrants and transpeople don't control 90% of all the money... / ['Everyone in the comment section lacks any sort of critical thinking skills. Trump loves the uneducated!']
The saddest part is, the amount of people that could listen to this entire thing and all they see is a bunch of billionaires with nefarious intent. It's all logical and maybe their interests is not letting this country fall because they realize the benifit for them and us, Yes? / []

its fine but it should be noted that these questions and answers were scripted.  Not saying its good nor bad really. But lets be honest here..... / []
The brilliant minds ❤ / []
The fact that the lines have not moved is significant... it means that lil ole ukraine is able to defend its terrorrity against paper tiger russia... fighting for the sovereignty of your country is something... us citizens would fight for their freedom for as long as possible.  In life, you can only keep what you have the power to defend and musk doesn't seem to realize that ukraine is actually able to defend whats theirs. The kd ratio between russia and ukraine is somewhere between 1:6 and 1:10... the russians are getting owned. / []
Awesome interview now Democrats and Liberals STHU! / []
Thank you all for the work you are doing! / []

This was amazing to watch and listen to. These men all seem sincere in what they are trying to do for this country. I applaud them, and it gives me hope. / []

This team is discovering how much money the government is stolen to people in social security, hope all this guys  can be let alone from the left so they can keep working as increíble as they are. Love ❤DOGE. / []
I agree 100% about the Ukraine war. That is why I am confused about Musk's Gaza/Israeli position. Why are we feeding military aid into the region? Its stopping the military aid into the region part of the solution as it is for Ukraine? There is a contradiction. Until there is no contradiction concerning the value of ALL HUMAN LIFE I cannot take Musk seriously. / []
Amazing job DOGE. Thank you for the great job! / []
In Doge we trust ! / []

The reason public sector retirees have to go through training for retirement is because of the options for payment in retirement depending on survivors, the limitations to work in public sector after retirement, completing beneficiary designation information, and explaining when and how to file for getting the retirement processed to line up with the actual date of retirement. / []

When can I give two thumbs up? / []

Keep going after the corruption! / ['And you expect a president with his own crypto currency to do that?']

We should all be standing ovation and applauding to these folks.  They are no ordinary people.  All of them are wealthy successful business folks with super talents.  What I'm seeing them is all having patriotic soul.  Specially Elon Musk, who has been taking all hits from those corrupt democratic politicians and fraudsters, are not afraid and simply keep doing for this great nations.  There's always one reason behind each of these successful people.  Hope viewers will find it from each member of DOGE team. / []
Love this. CNN do the same panel, ask your questions, have your delusions resolved. / []
BY his measure we should be 200 billion down. I don't see the number on X gov handle. / []

TEAM AMERICA!!!! / []
These are heroes and martyrs in my book.  They sacrifice themselves for the nation.   Thank you heroes! / []

So, the solution, by way of creating an efficient central computer system (AI system), results in COMPLETE CONTROL of any individual, should the control switch be in the hands of a malevolent power establishment.

This was the most powerful DOGE and Elon interview to date. I share the same anger and contempt for the virtue-signaling far-left. / []
I’m infuriated!!! Absolutely furious!! Taxes literally gut me every year!! Why? Because I’m not smart enough to cheat the government!  And then you hear about their absolute disdain for hard earned money!! And then you witness Democrat resistance. Unbelievable! / []
Elon just lied, lied, lied. He's being self-serving and he is cutting these that Americans NEED. Most of all, he is not being transparent. DOGE has been caught hiding certain cuts and sweeping massive mistakes  under the rug throughout this whole process. Comment if you need some examples. / ["Let's hear your examples."]

It's like finding out you have rats living in  your pantry. The more DOGE uncovers, the more the rats scatter / []
Thank you to all those men sitting there. We appreciate you. / []
Finally, we see what a blessing the internet could be. It’s been available forever but the idiots in Washington didn’t give a crap about using it to make government and Americans lives better. I hate Washington bureaucrats. They have kept their foot on our necks for decades - on purpose to further their own grift and graft. / []
Had to change my whole post because of the way I stand. , I suppose any help Elon Musk is doing is for the government. I support him 100%. / []
These men all look older than the 18-19 year old, uneducated, unqualified teens the left says they all are. How anyone can be mad at someone for saving their tax dollars and potentially reducing their tax burden, along with their future security benefits, is beyond me. I do this on a local government scale and, while my budget is in the multi millions, I am audited and responsible for fractions of pennies spent. If I’m off .004 of one cent, my job is on the line until I find the discrepancy. The odd thing is, people at the local level seem to understand this concept and will call requesting documentation of our audits. Meaning, they want proof of how the audit went. Those same people calling my office are the ones also on Facebook complaining about DOGE and the waste they’re finding. These people also receive print outs after each budget meeting with intent to buy or sell, as well as, receipts of each transaction.  The only difference: they can’t wrap their head around federal spending being so much more deceptive and misleading, and on a MUCH bigger scale. They don’t have media filling their heads with ridiculous ideology and pushing agendas. A multi TRILLION dollar budget should be FAR more meticulously audited and scrutinized, in my humble opinion. / []
Thank you God , it's the future for our children and grandchildren , they are saving America 🇺🇸 / []
God bless President Trump and these America-loving patriots! Risking it all to save all that we hold dear.  Real life - real time “heroes!” / []

I am so blown away. These men are wonderful. I am so moved by Elon Musk and these other men. Their hearts are fully committed to helping our country and I couldn’t be more grateful for them. Boy will I praying for them and their efforts. I love this country and I want to see us thrive.

When will they cut benefits for public servants? That’s why there’s so many cronies. One term gives you health insurance for life / []

It's good to see a group of smart people that aren't trying to trick you🎉 / []
Amazing interview! Thank you, Elon/DOGE for your caring, finally. Thank you, Father in Heaven. / []
“Which line do you not agree with?” And duh, they won’t even respond to that answer. Of course they wouldn’t. The left will never agree with things that DO make sense, but disagree based off of whether you’re one party or the other. It’s nuts. / []

When our government casually loses 1 billion dollars and the people can’t afford healthcare or food is a sad state of affairs. / ['Completely unacceptable! And We, The People need to hold our representatives feet to the 🔥', '@Jessica-ko1eg it’s no sad it’s disgraceful', "nothing to do with healthcare.  that's your congressional leaders getting in bed with the health insurance industries for years and taking kickbacks.  free healthcare could be solved overnight if anyone in congress on both sides had morals and spines to take on the industry .", 'Yeap trump just gave boeing 1 million dollars contract', 'The delusion is strong with this one.

Elon musk and the Doge team are doing    a awesome job!  They're a very smart group of men that know what they're doing and they are helping our country and our Americans who pay taxes. The people that are on the left that are complaining they need to be quiet. God bless Elon Musk and Doge Team 🙏🇺🇲 / []
😂 didn’t they say the DOGE team was a bunch of kids working there 🤣🤣 / []
Thanks to all of you. / []
Elone just showed what a good hearted person he is a sane thinker! / []
Kudos to the DOGE team / []
Bret thank you for a fabulous and informative show / []
For all of you watching this, there MUST be 2 sides or there is no order.  For order to exist, there MUST be chaos.   A Hegelian Dialectic exists in the structure of our civilization.  It exists purposely.  There is a thesis/antithesis between conservatives and progressives.  The synthesis at the top is the oligarchy that controls the worlds govts. / []
everyone wears a vest and tie except elon no class at all. this is not ukraine  president / []
This was a good interview / []
Bro this is insane! These people you can tell are the top echelon of their industries cleaning up government. What an unreal process. Everyone in the world would like to see this happen with their own governments! Imagine how bad it is in other countries. / []
❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪💪💪 / []
The best transparent interview of DOGE. Get informed. / []
Why do people hate this man? They must hate the country so much. / []
Anyone caught with their hand in the cookie jar should be made to pay every penny back and then off to jail! / ['I believe there will be clawbacks!!']
Most of the people who condemn DOGE are Narcissists who either benefit directly from the waste or know people who do.  Narcissists will say anything and do anything to get what they want.  They do not care about people.  That’s why they attack in generalities and don’t feel bad when they steal millions.  Narcissists do not feel remorse, they do not feel bad after stealing tons of money from you.  Narcissists are evil.  The good guys must win.  Go DOGE!! / []
It's so refreshing to hear Trump's appointees giving open honest answers about waste being found and what is being done compared to all the things Biden was hiding. / []
Which one is big balls?!?!😂 Elon is a stud. / []
Thank you Elon and the amazing  Doge team. Incredible job. This overhaul has been long overdue.  🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 / []
I wish South Africa had a doge team. Other countries are jealous. / []
Thank you Doge team. You guys are true heroes. 👏👏👏 / []
Thank God, President Trump cares so much for our nation’s people, that he hired these wonderful patriots that are committed to fix the financial crisis! God speed 🕊️ / []
19:15 BRUH treasury department was using just one bank account for all the momey transfer? Imagine if someone somehow gains access to that 💀 / []

Who needs Superman, Batman or Spiderman when you've got DOGE? True American HEROS!! 💪🇺🇲 / []
Amazing team! Well done 👏👏👏 / []
can we get a little deeper how is this happening?? Where are is the security? How many CTO's are there?? / []
This was awesome to see / []
Can we get the money back? / []
I like Elon but he better be careful not to step on a CIA blackhat slush fund and have people that don’t even exist come for him. The man is by far one of the greatest people of all time because he could be relaxing somewhere not willing to help and enjoy life but he CHOSE this! The government and the American people owe him a debt of gratitude / []
WE ARE NOT YOUR EXPERIMENTS / []
Tax the rich............ easy fix! / ['Rich people already get taxed genius..']

Finally real successful smart strong men in our government God bless them 🙏🏼 / []
I don't want stronger computers I would like to have the money back / []
It's mind boggling.  I moved from the private sector into local government, and I thought the efficiency was significantly worse, but comparing local government to what they're saying here about the Federal gov, it's still 10 times better.  We only have one CIO, and right now, I can retire.   I can immediately see on the website how much I would get if I retire now compared to 5, 10 years from now. / []
Well done DOGE / []
I hate Brett Baier / []
DOGE is amazing.  I wish we had you in my country.  Keep up the great work.  Only those who are benefiting from the corruption are screaming.  The ones taking advantage of innocent American people. / []
So, who are the recipients of these schemes?? / []
Elon Musk is actually driving the United States to the ground. STOP giving billionaires tax breaks while they rip off average hard-working Americans. / ['You’re really dumb']
This needs to go viral. / []
Where is Bigg Balls? Did he get DOGED? / []
Musk at the end, holy cow! / ['A true patriot']

I hear Shekels jingling... / []
Chubby Boy Bret Baier, who called Arizona for Biden in 2020 (and triggered the Widespread Election Vote Count Stop to allow millions of vote dump in the Battleground States!), now trying to remake himself as the fair and balance reporter…. lol 😂  I hate these dishonest mainstream media people…. / []
Awesome! / []
They are processed by Satan , they are being led by Satan. They are being deceived. They are Blind, and cannot see their wrong as seeing bad as good. Because of democratic congressmen and senators spreading lies. Those like chuck Schumer and others Corey booketbooker. And who spreads VIOLENCE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. / []
God bless business Elon amen / []
I just want to say thank you to these men for letting Americans sleep a little easier at night what you're doing as a patriot, and we thank you. / []
If you make $50,000 a year, it would take you 25,000 years to make a billion dollars / []
Bravo, Elon and Team! / []
Protect the people and protect their money, its essential...WE NEED DOGE IN EVERY STATE! / []
Thanks so much to Elon and the Doge Team & the leadership of DJTrump and the wonderful men and women in his administration.  You are all true patriots! / []
It would be hilarious if they found CC receipts to like dominos and Pizza Hut for a few billion. Proving that managements universal solution to unhappy employees is the pizza.. / []
great job..streamline other contries / []
Elon Musk will go down in history as the man who rescue America from going bankrupt. / []
virtue signaling karens shut your mouth lol / []
Anyone else angry yet???? If not for Pres. Trump this would have continued and literally broken our country, which is what the Left wanted. / []
Go Musk and Dodge team! !!! May God Bless each one of you and your family!!!! / []
Thank you all, extremely appreciated 🙏 Sharon C-J Burnet, TX / []
Very great testimonial and God bless your wife as well / []
Weirdness  Lack of facts, lots of claims and conclusions / []
Take a good look at the ones attempting to not only burn this guys stuff to the ground, but destroying the Teslas that people bought before Musk even became their enemy. Someone is terrified of this guy not because he is dangerous, but because dangerous people losing money from these cuts are terrified. / []
What a bunch of clowns, "tech support" can't even keep social security online, this is going to be one of the most hated groups in American history / []
Elon's right!!! / []
I really hope they don’t go after the federal officers pensions! These officers are being told, this is a possibility. 🙏🏼 / []
What the hell was that sound at 37:06?? Is that a woman crying? / []
THANK YOU 👍 TEAM ELON MUSK 👏 AND ALSO OF COURSE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 👏 👍 ❤🎉❤ LOVE ❤️ ☮️ 😍 AMERICA 🇺🇸 😀 / []
Elon accidentally said a 9 month year old 😅  The left is going to roast him for this.  Or maybe not bc most are too dumb to catch it.. / []
Keep up the good fight, gentlemen!  Thank you for what you're doing and the sacrifices you and your families are making.  God bless you and your families! God bless America!!! 🇺🇸 / []
I HAVE REPORTED REGULARLY AND THEY ARE MESSSING WITH EVERY ACCOUNT I HAVE. STRUGGLING JUST TO STAY ALIVE FROM THE GOVERNMENT FOR 5 YEARS. / []

Great interview / []
Elon is so right. / []
Where and when can I sign up to assist in the Trump/Musk DOGE effort! / []
Way to go! Who tf needs social security it’s not like we’ve worked our whole lives and paid into it!! I hate all these bottom feeders too! Also Medicaid /medicare!

LOVE ELON AND DOGE!!!!! / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team, we owe you a great deal of gratitude for saving our country. / []
🙌🙌👏👏👏😌 / []
Who cares we won't see a dime / []
Elon, you mean your idea is to help the ‘greatest Ponzi scheme’? The Irish have the expression “ too clever by half”. It is a good description of you, alas. / []
Thank you Doge. / []
Some great Americans right there….add President Trump in the room and call them our country’s re- founding fathers! / []
Why are democrats so disgusting and demonic ??? / []
We need to share this with everyone! I’m listening to these people, and I can’t believe the Democrats are not only opposing this, but they’re sabotaging the process in the courts! / []
A great idea that every department must have connected to each other / []
Thank you all!  So many can barely make it. We know they have tried to drain it. Thank you! No more money for Ukraine, we already saw a video of a man who was a whistleblower. How Biden and many getting rich over it. No. Kelly wants 2028. / []

We were about to go bankrupt, they were adding 1 trillion in debt every 100 days. / []
These are the real gentlemen. / []
Fantastic interview / []
Brilliant Thank you / []
Just a friendly reminder that X got hacked a few weeks ago by hacker Anonymous so DOGE saying SSA being digital will be more secured and user friendly? OK / []
He's100% correct about Senator Kelly.  Despite the patriotic bona fides, he has sold himself to China. He started a business with start up backing from a Chinese Communist investor and guess what the business makes......BALLOONS!!!!  Like the ones that flew uninterrupted over our military bases!! Kelly was Obama's pick to replace Biden before Biden endorsed Kamala and ruined that idea. / []
I LOVE THESE PATRIOTS! TRUE HEROES! / []
Thank you DOGE, Elon, and Fox / []
Let us not forget that those taking money and signing checks they are not entitled to need to be prosecuted. / []
NO MORE NETWORKING, YOU ARE ALL OUT TO HURT PEOPLE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. / []
I have to state this, That Was FNG AWESOME GOD BLESS / []
I love Elon's passion for this country & its citizens ❤👏👏👏👏👏👏 / []
Who's going to jail. Please we need to shame them / []

Let's go, team Elon!!💥 / []
You guys are the best… thank you!   The USA needs Elon Musk… this is quite obvious! / []
So who is actually getting the money?????????? / []
so all that "Peace, Justice and the American Way" brainwashing done to the kids of the 70's, 80's and early 90's is having an effect ... as the grip of the Baby Boomers on the controls loses strength / []
1 trillion out of 36 trillion! A lot of work to do. Let's be patient. / []
❤🎉❤ / []
I agree the fact that government systems do not talk to each other is a huge issue ! Ive  been argueing this for years how dumb this is . / []
Holy Moses! Thank you god! / []
Bet Elon didn’t know many couldn’t apply for the severance package gov offered. Gov entities made it exempt. Not allowed. / []
Amazing Doge team. Incredible business minded team. Appreciate all the work & dedication. / ["As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings.

Democrats are liar / []
They should be making a feature length film about Doge and how they are all being called up into action as DOGE Avengers team to save the country. Definitely need Big Balls as the protagonist. / []
"The president's plan is the only thing that will work " / []
He is so right about Senator Kelly, why put the interest of another country over America, when tax payers money is involved. Ukraine had enough of help from America, the only solution is end the war, He might be a former astronaut or decorative veteran, but doesn’t act like a patriot, Ukraine comes first than America. / []
Thank you DOGE!!! All of you gentlemen are helping change the future for our children and grandchildren!! / []
I’m amazed & unbelievably grateful to each & every one of these men! They all have the option of remaining in the private sector to make more money in the 140 days than I will probably make in my lifetime. But they’ve all chosen to put their private businesses aside (or in the hands of some else) so that they can play a HUGE roll in this endeavor to not only save our tax dollars but possibly our country from bankruptcy. Obviously our government leaders weren’t concerned about how they were spending our hard earned money 🤯.     Thank you to these men & all the DOGE employees for taking part. I am grateful for myself, but even more thankful for my children & grandchildren’s future! ❤️❤️❤️ / []
This is mind blowing. How can people disagree with what they are doing? / []
5YEARS AND NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. / []
Can Elon come to Canada, please? Please, Elon come! Please!  Liberals were major spendthrifts! / []
Looking forward to left wing spin on this interview for the next week. "He's coming after us!" / []
Say what you will about DOGE but you can’t deny their patriotism and love for America and Americans!❤ / []

These guys are patriots  Praying for you all and trump / []

How many people will be going to jail😂 / []
This was amazing / []
contrast a room of nerds trying to convince you that they are doing honorable work ... with politico-speak ... hilarious / []
Oh, and Mark Kelly is a traitor. And I live in Arizona / []
DOGE ... will not only drain the Swamp in the USA. It will also be used to allow them access to all information on all businesses and citizens in the USA.  The collection of information can then   be masterfully altered with no fear of being successfully investigated for decades.  Their intent is malicious and to use/or not use .. this altered information on all unsuspecting victims as a valuable   bargaining tool to sway persuasion to an outcome that they favor.  Starting in America first. Then in time  eventually globally.  Strong arming one country at a time with all types of disingenuous tactics through the expertise use of A.I. Armed with this powerful technology advantage. They will then threaten, black-mail all into surrendering to them willingly.   This will eventually enable and attain  their goals.   Which is ... "One World Order"?? / ['This sounds a bit too negative. USA will slowly (or speedily) decay in corruption if DOGE does not reach its goal. So it\'s a great thing! (You should not be overly skeptical. Leave some room for an almighty God who will give the USA a certain "reprieve" through the current administration. It will depend on whether the US and the West in general will return to God or not, whether our civilization will stand. At the moment, this does not look good, but the US has better chances than Europe). \n\nOf course, if those in power now have ulterior motives (and are secretly plotting for evil), we are all cooked, but why would you assume that is the case? It seems rather the opposite: evil people WERE in power, and this election was probably the last realistic chance to make a difference before the USA would collapse. \n\nThis can be a first great start and will hopefully be emulated in Europe and other areas.']
Go Doge / []
It's a shame musk has to explain in a grade 3 kind of way / []

Medicade is a big burden on tax payers for for freeloading drugged free rides free drugs free housing free food for able bodied freelaoders / []
Why not speak all this before the Congress? Because what congress currently does is not trying to help them, but to control, or worse, hinder them. Imagine the line of questions.  DOGE is a force of innovation, and Congress is like a headache best to avoid if possible. Maybe in 100 days DOGE will accumulate enough achievement to steamroll that Congress committee, innovation would have ensured victory over status quo, then Musk and DOGE chiefs will face Congress more squarely / []
What a great bunch of guys. They deserve the highest honor the American people can give them. They will go down in history as heroes if they are allowed to do their work. / []
To the Doge team- you are loved and appreciated by the majority.  How blessed Americans are to have you. 🇺🇸 💗 / []

Thank god they are doing the work they are. Sounds like they need to do this for years not days. / []

Thank you all / []
applying sound business principles to government is needed badly.  But exchanging the bloated Bureaucracy for a technocracy (which is the other side of Elon we are not seeing here) could be worse. Optumus robots and A. I. are also going to need to be regulated next. Who will do that work? / []
I agree with Doge and most everything that they are doing yes they are not perfect but the "cut once" prior to that measure 2 or 3 times is what I believe they are actually doing and people will not see that part it would make them crazier. / []
The people commuting in arsin is not because they believe in left propoganda, it's because of easy money they are offered. In india we have millions who will not hesitate  Because of lack of opportunities. / []

Awesome contribution to America. Thanks for DOGE. / []
The biggest "fraudsters" that Elon keeps rightly talking about are the politicians/judges into whose greedy pockets  all this obscene amount of hardworking taxpayers' money is going.  That is why they are rabidly opposed to this much needed clean-up.  Thank you, DOGE!   God bless you and protect you. / []
And the democrats have a problem with this. OK, if you are still a Democrat, you are part of the problem. / []

Pelosi, McConnell, Schumer and others, who have been imbedded in our government, shame on you !! You probably were aware of all of this.  Criminal!!!!!! / []

All these guy are American Heroes in my book. This won't affect a single one of them. They are giving back to America. / []
Apparently most social security recipients are democrat voters.... / []
I'm a Tesla car owner and stock holder and this makes me more proud all the time that DOGE is doing this work! / ['Good for you buddy', '👍👍👍', 'Ditto. Got the shares but working on the Tesla purchase lol 👍', '\u200b@cptscotchtapelol yup, good on ya mate! Nice Tesla lol', "Yeah, I really wish I could afford to invest in some of their stock and even more so buy a tesla right now. I'm currently looking for some idiot that's willing to give away theirs...lol. Thank You for supporting Elon and supporting America First...🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯"]
SOCIAL SECURITY - TOLD ME WHEN I GOT MARRIED -  THAT I HAD TO HAVE A NEW SSN#  & THAT MY CURRENT  SSN# WOULD BE CANCELLED!!!  THEY SAID THEY  WOULD GIVE ME A NEW ONE - WHEN I COME TO THE  SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE!!!  I TOLD THEM NO - I GOT  THAT SSN# WHEN I WAS BORN & AM KEEPING IT!!!   YOU DON’T GET A NEW SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER  BECAUSE YOU GET MARRIED!!!  SOUNDED LIKE A  SCAM & I HAVE KEPT MY ORIGINAL SSN# !!! / []
Elon is more American than any Democrat in America. If you can’t comprehend the level of dedication, passion and love this man has for America then you are beyond redemption. Wake up! / ['Amen']
Brave and social People! / []

As an Iraq Veteran and thirteen year Army Vet I 100% agree with Musk on Mark Kelly. Just because someone is an Astronaut and decorated Vet doesn't give him a free pass on his behavior, our prisons are full of decorated Vets who are locked up because of things they've done and didn't get a pass because of their service or decorations. Mark Kelly is a Dirt Bag! / []
I say fantastic 🎉🎉🎉 / []
I suddenly have this strange urge to purchase an entire DOGE wardrobe. Hat, tshirt, scarf, purse ... flashing sunglasses? This is the best thing that has happened to the USA in a long time. / []
I’m listening to these people, and I can’t believe the Democrats are not only opposing this but sabotaging the process in the courts! / []

My cousins parents used her ssn to ruin her credit when she was a child. Please stop the craziness. / []
God Bless this Team.. God Bless Mr.Musk. / []
What an amazing team!!! They're true American heroes. Bravo to you all!! 👏👏👏 / []
God Bless these warriors / []
Sometimes, Elon reminds me of John DuPont in foxcatcher. But only sometimes though. / []
Thank you guys keep going 😃 / []
A commenter asked why isn't every Network showing this and just Fox. I tried to reply but the Moderator was to Biased to post. Was just saying; Ask Elon. Other Networks don't like to give a forum to undocumented and unsubstantiated BS claims without asking a lot of tough questions Elon the fraudster wouldn't or couldn't answer. It would be embarrassing for him. / []
May America be grateful for the work you are doing your all heroes Elon Thankyou From the bottom of my heart May the Lord Jesus Christ give you all the necessary tools and wisdom to accomplish your goals / []
I disagree with Musk on his “propaganda” comment and how they are to blame for the fire-bombing of Teslas. No. The fire- bombers themselves must take personal responsibility for this. It is THEIR fault. But whatever. . .   Also, I love making fun of the Tesla. But NEVER would I advocate anyone to harm Mr Musk’s Tesla, his X program, his satellite company nor his spaceship. I actually like the  dude. I’ve come to his defense more than once. In fact, my sister has a Tesla. It’s a magnificent car. More quiet than my cat going into a garage. But I just can’t resist teasing Musk. He’s sincere, successful, cute, surprising, brave, intelligent, fun and a better dancer than the President (Shhh, don’t tell him). And his products really are excellent (especially that satellite service).   I just don’t know why they don’t find a way to write off a couple trillion dollars and leave it at that? You know? 😂 / []
Show the full interview Fox / []
Can you investigate Ticketmaster next? lol / []
💯 / []
I will believe it when I see the national debt reduced by a trillion. I’m not holding my breath and nor should you. / []
A full circle moment was it not the majority of the individuals that signed the declaration of independence wealthy? Was it not their beliefs that without their actions this would not be a free nation this is all repeating itself. May God bless you and keep healthy and blessings to you all. / []
DOGE team  are gifts from God   ✝️ / []
👏🏼  👏🏼  Thanks.  Blessings.  Protection.  👏🏼  👏🏼 / []
True heroes. Can't wait for a movie to be made about this. / []
Thank you Elon Musk 🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
We need to protect Elon at all cost / []
Brett Brair, I thought you were better than a puff piece. / []
AMAZING!  MUSK AND HIS TEAM ARE HEROES! / []
Airbnb guy lost huge credibility points when he said “an Apple Store like experience.” / []
The American men and women have been ripped off for years, working seven  days a week just trying to stay above water .😡🤬 / []
Thank you for having this interview. It was informative and I’m hoping this will put Americans minds at ease.❤️🙏🏻✌🏻🇺🇸❤️😇 Special thanks to the Doge team. ❤ / []
Now they are cutting the number of food bank deliveries. Literally taking the food from poor peoples mouths. While you fools go on about how great they are. / []
After that, democrats will never win election again. IF THEY ever ever win again it will be due to cheating / []
They are literally saving the country for all generations to come / []
In China to fix any debts they would probably prevent their citizens from eating too much rice to save money for the next year. Good job DOGE and Elon of course, full support here. / []
WOW THAT was intense and Perfect ,gotta love this Mans Huge Heart. I totally agree with Him . / []
What a catastrophic mistake to expose these guy’s identities. They will surely be targeted now. Elon should have known better. / []
Never liked Musk as a person but will give credit when good things get done. / []
How to guarantee a win at the up coming election, cut a deal to bring Musk here when he's finished in the USA....... / []
Elon is a rock star. I am thankful for his genius and care. / []
I’m SO PROUD of Elon and this group of successful men who have chosen to sacrifice their time to invest their skills & knowledge to correct ALL that’s wrong & corrupt financially in our nation.. THANK YOU so much,,,, the backlash you’re receiving is simply proof that you’re on the right track doing the right thing!God Bless all of you & your efforts! / []

Very good job Elon Musk and Doge staff😊 / []

Thank You to Elon and his team at DOGE. Outstanding work fella’s / []
Word is Elon even got Gilligan off that island. / []
American heros 😊 / []
DOGE MAGA / []
Ex Democrat here … I’m really enjoying watching how the Republican Party is not just talking but actually putting their words in action … finally opened my eyes to the manipulation from the left … the truth always prevails .. all they do is repeat things to make them facts and make you feel hate / []
ELON 🇺🇸 TY / []
I am not against what Musk and DOGE are doing.. I think it's incredible... BUT.. I think Musk and all the people he works with could transform this country even more than the budget stuff by revolutionizing the education system in the US and the world. But his AI company might do that too so my point might be moot. / []
I appreciate what each of you are doing for our country. / []
Thank You, For All..your hard work✨  You Guys Are Amazing ❣️ 🇺🇸💞🇺🇸💞 / []
Elon Musk is literally Tony Stark. Spaceships, weapons, saving the world. / []
M A G A TY ELON / []
2075 history books. The men that saved your country kids. They made America honest and moral. / []
TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOTS / []
Great video / []
only the dumbest of the dumb will ignore the facts & believe whats coming from this oligarchs lying mouth. / []
Thank you Elon. / []
U S A !!!!!!! / []
DOGE needs to be permanent.   They need to tackle the VA too.  Ive seen many vets come for dental tx just because the VA do not cover most of it or the wait is too long.  These are our veterans who fought for the country and we cannot push them to the forefront for medical and dental?  I hope Elon fix this. / []
Waste like the space program? / []
Thank you all and special thanks to President Trump. / []
Finally, analytically minded people solving analytical problems. BTW, Steve, you look like Data from Star Trek. 😊 / []
Really good! / []

No negros in the group / []
Great Job Elon, Keep rolling Sir, We Make America Great Again stand With you. / []
These guys are amazing. I enjoyed every second of this. It's so refreshing after the last 4 years. / []
Every American should see this. Drop the toxic politics and propaganda and just listen to the numbers. It is unbelievable how much waste and corruption is woven into our representatives on both sides. Actual exposure to factual data is the first step to getting our country back from the brink. / []
So cute that you hear Elon’s kids in the studio background. He’s quite a novel kind of dad. / []
We need federal employment limits.  You can only work for the federal government for a total of 12 years in your life.  (Except for the military.) / []
We better get some more Republicans on our team after this interview. That 27% democratic approval rating is way to high / []
Reducing government spending was done already in 1993 during Clinton administration - and somehow they did it without accidentally firing people maintaining nuclear weapons or preventing ebola outbreak. How come Musk can't do it this way? / []
Good Lord, the plot thickens.. / []
The enemy is within 👿 / []
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. God bless America. Tax the billionaire a trillion dollars.🙈🙊🙉🗽🇺🇲 / []
This should have been done in the beginning, it was a big over sight not having done this.  Americans appreciate transparent clear communication that can go a long way to calming uneasy people. / []
This is good only if the little guy will benefit just as much as the big guy will.   There are way more little guys than big guys in our country. / []
Hi, Doge—I need a book. How wildly inefficient the government has been financially would be salacious material for the public. The is no debate in the right being done here; a book will properly cement the truth and history of this plight. / []
I really like this but I wish news agencies would stop editing videos.  It's one thing to change camera angles, but the audio should be uninterrupted from beginning to end.  This was great, but where is the rest of it!? / []
I thought about what Elon says at the end about Ukraine. I believe Elon is a good man, so why are our views so different. I agree that the loss of life on both sides has been so extremely sad. I always wished Russia was more friend than foe. I was upset that we didn't provide more of a deterence before it started. I saw at the time how this was going to go. One of the few benefits of age. Everything repeats. Human behaviour doesn't change. Upon reflection why do I run towards fire to protect others when it is against my self interest. I suppose it comes down to who you empathise with. Growing up with the WWII generation I don't think for a minute that Europes problems will stay with Europe. How can we discourage Russia from being so aggressive with its neighbors. I'm not a fan of people or countries that take from others by force. I will always empathise with the one protecting their home from aggression. Ukraine territory wasn't taken by vote. It was taken by bullet. The one possible exception is the Donbas. / []
DON'T YOU FEEL ONE THING.  HOW DUMB STUPID AMERICANS ARE  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  NOW EVERYTHING IS COLLAPSING. SHOWING OFF THE WHAT A UNARQ AMERICA IS  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 / []
Instead of talking about it, prove it. / []
As a Dutch-Italian guy living in India I say thank you to DOGE, because you are providing a very interesting concept, a blueprint if you will, that could change the future of citizens in any country willing to implement an idea akin to DOGE.  I sincerely hope it helps the US to stay solvent, and taxpayers' money to be more respected than ever by those spending it.  All the best USA ❤🎉😊 / []
Elon was railing against social security on JRE. He said it's a ponzi scheme, etc. So dems are right to question DOGE's actions / ['Weird when 65,000 Liberal NGO were paid over 2.1 trillion in government grants during Biden administration and the only people mad about Dodge are liberals… hmmm wonder why…2.1 trillion went somewhere']

God Bless the DOGE TEAM!  Glad they are finding the waste and fixing how our money is spent. / []
This is quite simply a battle between good vs evil. No rational person can watch this interview and claim that these highly successful patriotic VOLUNTEER businessmen are lying- about anything.   The Dems are screaming because their decades long criminal racketeering and grift is finally being exposed.   By god DJT said he was going to drain the swamp and these guys know how to do it. / []
This was an OUTSTANDING PROGRAM! / []
Wow-- this was the MOST interesting interview I've heard, perhaps ever. Great job! / []
Thank you Elon and the others 🙏 ❤ / []
It’s a relief to know  USA is actually looking at the “swamp” that was draining our country Thank you / []
Wow!! / []
I think speech is free for people but News should be held to higher standards by the FCC. / []
This group has to answer questions at CNN.  Talking to the choir is not helping. / []
Good interview. Elon put the smartest guy in the back. / []
Once again both the Democrats and media have got what DOGE is doing all wrong.. So when you hear w Elon and crew are taking away you SSA services is completely wrong, they are saving our tax dollars for those who legitimately deserve this money. DOGE is the best thing that happened to Government in 80 years, / ['What do you think about the department of education being defunded?']
Thanks, boys, Americans stand with you well, the good ones, at least. / []
Elon musk has become a patriotic American.   His accent is even slowly changing or atleast he's trying / []
That was wonderful. Great job. Tha k you Doge team. Elon thank you so much. We are praying for you all for wisdom  and for your safety. / []
President Trump has been subjected to a systematic smear campaign for years by Al Arabiya, Al Arabiya Al Hadath and all the channels owned by Alwaleed bin Talal, which have been and continue to blatantly serve the agenda of Hillary Clinton and the extreme left. Despite their escalation in misinformation, distortion, exaggeration and lies in formulating news for the people of the Gulf, the White House still allows correspondents from these channels to enter the White House and accompany President Trump on his trips. This gives credibility to their false news about President Trump and his administration. I hope this information reaches the relevant authorities, an investigation is launched and this group is deterred. They are no less dangerous than terrorists. / []
Thank you guys. So much. My children thank you and my children's children. / []
Take care US citizens, there is self interest here, as who will own the new systems and profit from them?   If they are genuine, they would set up a central it system as a not for profit, otherwise this is undemocratic.  Please hold these well intentioned people to account, as I fear the people are part of a growing autocratic approach.   Elon has self interest with X and as the genius he is, what better way than to get to have free advertising via the president!   So when Trump says he hasn’t asked me for a thing, I think Elon needs to come clean.   Recent article: ‘When Elon Musk bought X for $44 billion in 2022, more than a quarter of that was financed by loans from banks including Morgan Stanley. Banks normally quickly sell off such loans, but in this case they kept much of that debt because investors were reluctant to bet on the social media company’s floundering business. Mr. Musk’s newfound power in President Trump’s administration has helped change investors’ minds’.  Just saying as an observer looking in. / []
So Simple, So Logical and So lucky for the USA 👍 / []
Sooo we gonna use XRP to achieve the goal of seeing the payments in real time using the XRP ledger? / []

GREAT JOB... NUFF SAID!!!! / []
Just like what Elon said, the fraudsters are the most loud.  I work in a retail store, I had encountered fraudsters, Elon is right.  These fraudsters tried to scare me by being forceful and loud face to face.  Lol!😢 / []

Thank you Elon Musk and all those working so hard to allow we the Americans to know the truth, the monies spent and where, and to fix systems that none of us that I know of knew about. / []
I'm going to video tape this. Absolutely unbelievable. Bless each and everyone of you. / []

Please share this with everyone you know / []
This IS news! Thank god for this administration. These are examples of real American heroes putting their careers on hold to serve our country and people. Very inspirational. / []
What is so confusing about their English? They are updating the system and saving our money and putting it back in our pockets. / []
You got to be a special kind of an idiot to believe that couple of billionaires suddenly decided to do something for regular people. / []
They're goons in California and they're not really allowed to do business here any more so they moved to Texas. Yeah, you can just move to Texas then. Or atleast that's how it went for Tesla, Elon's goon corporation. Elon's just a goon. That's funny. Go back to South Africa Elon, and don't come back. / []
God Speed and bless these patriots. / []
Elon is simple awesome! ❤ / []
Saving a lot by not paying so many peoples paychecks anymore, all justified ? Who knows / []

Wow wow wow !!! I’m speechless and emotional at the same time. This is huge and amazing, this is what we call patriotism and love for your country. They’re the real patriots and heroes that deserve credits, respect and recognition for what they’re doing to save this country and its people. President Trump is a true American hero. / ["As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!"]

Bravo Efficiency team/ your time and dedication is heroic. Thank you / []
I give a positive view tht we are seeing a good person trying to help and thoes that are trying to stop him are the evil. / []
I know more than Elon! Your neurolink is a joke! / []
Excellent interview and revealing of just how important DOGE is needed. / []
Very critical for the country and bad for  democrats / []
Non elected Musky talking about "We think..." this and that.   This little shadow government is the new Deep State running the government. / []
40 percent of people calling in to change the bank account to which their social security benefits are going to are fraudsters and many people are losing their benefits to these scammers.   DOGE is fixing this. Wow. / []
The only reason people are scared over this is because the DEMOCRATS repeatedly tell people the sky is falling. When in fact  the weather forecasts BLUE SKY'S AND SUNSHINE. / []
I love the transparency of the trump admin. Trump os the best president we’ve had in a long time. I hated the man i. 16 the media is evil and brainwashing us. Musk said it best in this video. “Those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it, those who vitrue signal… but have no solution” / []
How is not there 340 million views .. / []
💙Just grateful for these men for loving America🇺🇸 / []
But Elon, a baseball does bat 1.000 tho..  Maybe, I  heard you wrong. Did you say "Baseballer"? / []

Go to ZERO Based Budgeting so the congress cannot claim  budget reductions for simply reducing the growth in budget  which is what they do currently with baseline budgeting method.

I keep watching this and I am getting  more angry! They have literally cancelled many NIH grants and stopped research across universities. They thought a grant was about gender when were talking about mice simply because they didn’t know the definitions or the meaning of the work. it is clear that they  out of their depth. They are not the people who should be doing this. People are not against DOGE itself. They are against the lack of transparency, lack of data the lack of documentation, the conflict of interest and the lack of ethics that started the office. People have a hard time getting behind the office who is supposed to be efficient and transparent and the people associated with the office are not. / ['You’re the problem. Get a job.']

approximately 3,000,000 federal workers at end of 2024, .15 = 15%      15% of 3,000,000 = 450,000, now if you meant .15% that would be .0015 0f 3,000,000 which equals 4500. are we to believe your numbers with 7000 said to be fired just from SSA or are you just making it up as you go to pass along to people that don't question , Wake up America / []

I am 67. I have had concerns about our budget and deficit for decades. When I complained about it  often, the answer was. Why do you care about the government is pay paying for it! And I would think the same one taking taxes from my check.  I do believe our economy could get worse before. We all may have to give up something. I am okay with that.  There has been too much government and too much waste within the government for too long.  DOGE gives me hope.  Thank you. / ['Yes, change is needed.

We include Elon Musk in our daily prayer. Thank you so much Elon and DOGE Team. 🙏🇺🇲👍. Government Agencies need to change their system of executing and depleting budgets that were appropriated. It should be change to efficiently spending the appropriated budget BASED ON NEEDS; and rewards those government agencies who SAVES more of their appropriated budget and returned to taxpayers. Spending budget EFFICIENTLY that saves cost, time, and effort; EFFECTIVELY reached their NEEDS to accomplish their objectives. / []
Elon is stubborn, and he ain't quitter. Good for America. / []
I want to know who got that money from the retires over 100 years of age. / []
What good is it to save whatever they're going to save, when they are going to add trillions to the national debt by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest. Plus Elon has huge conflicts of interest since he gets billions in government contracts. / ['Come on over to middle America 🇺🇸 we invite 🫵🏼']

Most likely a thousand quadrillions  of tax payer dollars have been wasted for nothing over the past 60 plus years.

The thing that nobody is talking about is the people in the government that have been steeling from the treasury. Congress is one.

That interviewer is one of those typical people that are so used to dumbing down concepts for the masses.

COMMON SENSE / []
I think it’s nauseating how still these legacy media stations cannot help but ask the obvious, dramatic questions like they hold the pulse of the American people. It’s very strange given the years put in, but I guess resting on your laurels is everywhere however they shouldn’t be surprised as to why people don’t get their news from them / []

This is all theater, not reality. Things are not as simple as they make them out to be, and a country the size of the United States cannot have a "small government." If anyone wants to actually say that it loud, military spending is where all the waste goes.  The truth is $100 billion net worth was unheard of 20 years ago. Soon it will be pocket change for the richest people in the world. This is the problem, not government spending.

Brett that was sooo great that you did this!!  It gave the people doing this job that HUMAN feature that was needed for the American people to see them and Relate TO them. They aren't the Invisible, Axe wielding monsters that people maybe be envisioning they are. You hear their explanations and the reasons they are doing this and why it's important to OUR country and it's Because they Love this country. Hearing them talk about the Crazy things they are finding, what a total mess it is and how they plan to fix it just clarified everything so much!  I was for this happening even IF they just took a buzz saw to it but they just made everything so clear!  Was awesome, IMHO! Thanks to Elon and all these fine, dedicated men and TY Brett!!! / []

You want an example of how Social Security works? I retired in May of 2022 and in January of this year my social security check was $170 short. I called Social Security and they passed me to Medicare. I was on the phone for 2 hours with Social Security trying to get through their automated system and speak to a person. They directed me to Medicare. Said the problem was there. The initial call I made was in February and I was told that Medicare messed up and they would send me the shortage on my next check. It didn't come on my next check or the check in March. I called Medicare back and was on the phone with them for an hour and was told they couldn't figure it out and they would have an auditor call me within the next 7 days. The auditor called back the next day and he said that the 170.00 that I was short was from when I initially signed up for Social Security in 2022 and that Medicare had forgot to take my first installment out of my first social security check. It took them almost a full 3 years to catch this. I didn't get a letter of explanation or anything that would tell me why they took the money out. At this point I had to take their word because I have no way to go back 3 years and find out what happened on my first social security check. I would say the system needs to be updated / []
So this group of rich white boys represent what slice of the American public? Not the ones fealing the affects of all those cuts that's for sure.

God Bless Doge / []
Everyone of us can agree that we should reduce debt as quickly as possible. I only wish the trump admin could have asked congress to pass a law for this DOGE creation and operations. GOP does have majority in congress slim as it may be. If elon and his team really care about US debt and budget deficits, then they should have obtained a congressional approval through law for DOGE. Otherwise the next admin whoever it may be will just scrap this DOGE because trump issued it through EO. The next president who may be fiscally irresponsible will just scrap the DOGE and spend more again & we are right back at the beginning. This whole effort goes in vain if that's the case. Remember it is always ... always easy to spend more than to save. / []
This is good to listen to.. I think a lot of governments around the world need this sort of auditing... / []

These guys keep repeating the same script. Elon has said all of this repeatedly before. I am glad to see these guys faces and hear them speak. Which one of them is Big Balls?   Some new updates are good. I want to see them present physical evidence of the things they are saying. Why not show us their processes? That would be “max transparency “!   And as to the mine situation, why not just build a few much bigger elevators? Or tunnels! Elon could use the Boring company to make direct routes to the records. 🤔😉   Make it so! / []

His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\r\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \r\nSources:\r\nBBC World\r\nNews\r\nReuters"]

Where is Big Balls?? 😂😂 / []
How is it that we weren't hearing about people being scammed out of their social security money until now?  You would think that would have been all over the news before DOGE found it if it were really true. / []
Well for start this is not a business it's a government! And if you pretend the government's going to run like a business then you're mistaken. Elon thinks what he's done is making the government more efficient no it hasn't but it has done is it's made most Americans  scared shitless! I'm serious now Social Security is being attacked by the Republicans and Trump and Elon also Medicare and Medicaid. I put into Social Security just like everybody else except for people that made over $10 million like Elon hasn't put any money into Social Security and all his Rich Buddies they should have to do that. So what's going to happen when your grandmother or your grandfather or your brother that's disabled doesn't get the social security check? Howard  lug nuts thinks it's not going to be a big deal if the little old ladies have to eat dog food for a month or you're disabled brother can't get around the house because there's no money to pay for the caregiver or your your grandfather in the old folks home has been thrown out onto the street because Medicaid has been defunded. This is real life boys and girls. Elon doesn't care their house in the Senate Republicans don't care about your father or mother or  disabled relative let him die I've heard that from Republicans. Well see they don't understand that there's almost a hundred million Americans to get the service that paid into this and if they don't get their check all hell's going to break a loose you think January 6th was bad wait until a little old ladies with Molotov cocktails, marching and they can throw real good. / []

This is the most transparent group in the White house in a long time. Many of those involved are interviewed often, take questions, and show exactly what they're attempting to do. Elon even said clearly that there will be mistakes, but that they will correct them as soon as possible. Instead of making up unfounded allegations, maybe we should just wait and see what they come up with, and if it works. The Dems are simply terrified that the government can be reduced and also be more efficient. And they know if Elon and Doge are successful, they will have to totally change how they operate. / []

What a great Interview ! Thinking back over the past few years, I have to conclude that there once was a special feeling about being an American, we didn't stand on a pedestal looking down at others that needed help. An American, looks down and then reaches out a hand to help other Americans and extends the offer to all.  That's not done by not having a moral compass and giving the appearance of helping,  Elon Musk has the  Moral conviction that as an American we just do what needs to be done, Americans are still very capable of doing the right thing. I see the spark of the founders of our great country in both President Trump and Elon Musk.  Thank you / []

DOGE!!! Making America Great Again!!!💪😎✌ / []
No1 goes to jail? Smh / []
This had to happen.  Without an audit no business can keep its head above water. America is a business and waste has been going on for decades. / []
DODGE rules!! Thank you all!! / []
HHS    40  OFFICES  OMG-     IRS   1500  PEOPLE TO  ISSUE  COMPUTERS?   OMG / []
HOLEE CRAP! / []
UNELECTED / ['And making the biggest difference for Americans, imagine that']
This will only help for a short time. Unless they also eliminate the Fed Reserve and return us to the gold standard. / []
I will buy new Tesla Model 2 because it is the best car for me / []
Great progress considering they are working with outdated systems.   GOD bless these gentlemen. Peace / []
TOTALLY AGREE WITH ELON MUSK / []
Best interview of the group of unsung heroes.Amazing.! / []
I could see him running for presidency like trump did mark my words / []
i feel until they fully fix the problem with where our tax money has gone with out telling us .....then we should not have to pay for taxes / []
Been saying this for years, no leadership and breads corruption, please keep up the great work, we need u Elon back in Canada some day. / []
I’m extremely amazed about how Elon was aware of the what his team are doing. He adds more if he thinks something needs to be said. No wonder why his the richest person in the world. That kind of awareness is what u called he cares. / []
Every American needs to hear this. / ['It’s simply the smart, kind people making sure that all of our tax dollars are being spent wisely.']
God Bless Elon and all who are saving our country.  God Bless America.  God bless all Americans. / []
Wow wow wow .. what a revolutionary group of patriots!! Thank God for these geniuses!!! / []
America is blessed. Thanks Elon and team. 🙏🏻 / []
🙏 THANK GOD for Mr Elon Musk and his team 🙏  GOD BLESS 🙌 Mr Elon Musk and his team 😊❤ / []
Thank you to the whole team you guys are doing a great job keep it up / []
LOVE ELON!!!! / []
Where is the proof Musk.  Stop his lies.  God bless you all for the truth and laws we fight for in our country and America ❤❤ / []
The only thing missing from this interview is Big Balls!!!! I wish he was here in the interview as well!!!!! / []
I felt that “For What!?” / []
Congress authorized the spending.  Musk needs to show us the Bill #'s for the "savings" so we can READ the bills & hold them accountable. / []
richest man on the earth with access to government data.......... not gonna end well........ / []
THANKU, ELON MUSK, FOR  YOUR PRECIOUS TIME, AND YOUR GENIUS,   GIFTED TO WE THE PEOPLE!!! AMERICA!     YOU ARE MAGNIFICENT,  COURAGEOUS BEYOND MEASURE!!!! / []
This is fantastic and incredible what they are finding out. Little babies can have bad credit. I wish Elon Musk could give me a little advise on how to start a business I would be rich. / []
What did Biden do for 4 years?… / []
If you’re reading this and haven’t liked the video. Like the video.. / []
Outstanding. / []
Go Elon & team!!!! / []
I am so proud that there are still many good people who care about the American people. God bless, please protect the DOGE team and Mr Musk. ❤❤🎉🎉 / []
NAWWW THESE MF'S JUST FOUND A NEW  WAY TO STEAL OUR FUCCIN MONEY / []
My husband passed away four years ago and he is still getting jury duty notices... This is such BULLSH!T / []
Bless these men 🙏 / []
This was an amazing dialogue. / []
The FRAUDSTERS are the one's screaming at DOGE!  They are mad because they're being found out.  They are thieves.  / []
Why don't I see any black person in Elon's group? Does that mean we black folks are not competent enough? / []
Hopefully Brett B has learned a few things thru this inter-view. / []
Amen 🙏 !! no we do not like corruption !! we do want to see where our money is going to !!  Elon is doing an amazing job thank the Lord. We have him and all his amazing team. 👏👏👏 keep it going we all need to know in Jesus name I pray amen. 🙏 / []
Team Doge awesome. Thank you. You gentlemen are true American Patriots. / []
YOU AN HEAR HIS KID IN THE BACKGROUND DID ELON GIVE THE MOMMY STARE? / []
Should I stay with PayPal / []
Bring back BigBalls! / []
The goal of the Democrats is clear : maintaining them dinosaurs at the lead of the country, steeling it and bringing it to bankruptcy. Democrats means treason. 🫵 / []
That’s why Democrats hate and scared DOGE. / []
Just don't forget their Jasmine Crockett it's the white man's fault just ask NPR / ['Lol', 'I rebuke her.']
Isn’t it aim, steady, fire? Why fire then be steady then aim 😂 or ready, aim, fire?? / [': - )']
Heroes all. The country owes them a tremendous debt for their selfless sacrifices for the betterment of all Americans,,many of whom are persecuting them. / []
30:24❤ / []
Awesome report. Thank you. These guys are doing God’s work. Period. / []
HHS - NIH     27  CENTERS  - 700 IT  SYSTEMS     AND  CHIEF  " OFFICERS"   HOW MANY  HIDDEN  DATA  IN THESE SYSTEMS;       HOW ABOUT       WE  GET  HONEST  AND STRAIGHT  ABOUT  FAUCIS  FUNDING  FAVORS  TO  COMPLPICIT   LABS  THAT  COVER  UP   BAD SCIENCE   LIKE   MRNA / []
These guys are all heroes for doing this. Making life harder for fraudsters steeling from retirees, helping the government remain solvent, exposing the abuse or our money. If they accomplish their mission, they'll be legends. / ["Soon you will find out if they are heros or u are a fool who can't think and see things for himself."]
Thank you Elon, Thank you DOGE. Any of those dumb politicians looking to increase our taxes without slashing wasteful spending first should be deported.🎉 / []
GOOD JOB GUYS / []
🤓🤓🤓 / []
Corporatizing the gov. Isn’t good either. / []
Most people see through this huxters farce.   Gaslighting 101. / []
LOVED THIS! What DOGE is doing VS liars club on the other side. Only brainwashed clowns listen to the left; ignorance is bliss, so be happy! / []
I hope the hyperfocusing by the DEMs on the SIGNAL oops results in 2 outcomes.  #1: The connection that the CEO of NPR is also the CEO of SIGNAL.  #2: That it is determined that a new super secure system is mandated and ELON gets the contract to develope it.  *winning / []
Thankyou for your service! You’re doing the best job ever, so proud and grateful to you all / []
Where''s big balls? I want to meet him! / []
DOGE ❤ / []
Thank you, we are so happy! Coming from private business this has to happen! / []
This group is awesome !  Thank you Elon, thank you guys !  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
NEXT, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE? WHEN WILL THEY BE ARRESTED? / []
Great man / []
I think it’s fair to say, those people on yt crying about social security being taken away are right. Their fraudulent checks are going to stop, and they are panicking!!! / []
Go on doge / []
This is a must watch for any American who cares about the financial future of their country.  Elon Musk and his team are doing incredible work here!  We are fortunate that these great people are taking time out of their lives to do this work, and that we have a president who is actually doing something to save this country.  These are true American heros at work here!  Thank you a 1000 times over! / []
So evil to try to scare the elderly! / []
That is where all the 30 grand hammers went 2 / []
What a douchebag...  cutting any critical services.... meaning people eating... not dying to simple health problems... / []
Best interview Bret Baier ever did... excellent! 👍👍👍👍👍 / []
Many had been partying in Las Vegas for years on that money 💴 / []
Hell yeah! Do it!!! / []
Don’t let morons get you down Elon you are doing an incredible job and it’s sad so many people are attacking you. The only good thing about what the left is doing is that if they keep it up we will surely win another four years of good policy / []
Thank you DOGE! I'm 100% behind you to fix the broken system😅 / []
THANK YOU FOR THIS POSTING!! 💸🌞 / []
Why is it that the Democratic party has been caught and lie after lie starting with Hillary Clinton Hunter biden's laptop Russia Russia Russia January 6th not to mention Afghanistan leaving 800 billion dollars worth of our money there what in the hell is going on I think I'm just tipping the iceberg I think it goes way deeper / []
Thank you to these great Americans! The work they’re doing with help generations to come! 🙏🏻🇺🇸❤️ / []
How can you argue this?? ❤❤ / []
Millions of people praying for President Trump and Mr. Musk!!! There is power in prayer 🙏🏼 THANK YOU for your sacrifices ✝️ / []
Does SSA still use Token Ring? I worked on those systems decades ago.  They were actually hiring the mentally challenged for their IT departments. / []
Yes Elon, there is some real EVIL out there, there has been for years, keep the faith, THE PEOPLE ARE WITH YOU! / []
How come the little minion 19 yr olds aren't sitting there?? Fox News is absolutely discredited and shameful!! / []
Can We get $$ back from ALL of those who knowingly STOLE it~?~?~? / []
Their full of it lol / []
Amazing work…thank you🇺🇸 / []
1% of federal spending / []
Thank you Elon and the team I am really grateful / []
Man's got conviction. / []
MY HEROES!!!! Medal of Freedom for Elon! 🎖🇺🇸 / []
Can he even speak English? It’s really difficult to think in your dailect and tell a  lie in another language / []
Hurry up . / []
Elon,thank you! / []
We gat right people men, let's just shout up / []
I love the greatest tech nerds in the world running DOGE! I say this as a subpar wanna be tech nerd. Thank you all for your service! / []
Math nerd redemption!! Love it and here for it! -The Humble Accountant. / []
These are all great men. God bless them and all of their work. / []
God bless you guys. Most of us stand firmly behind you. Thank you. / []
He is not “careful” at all.  He sees numbers, not people. Wait until he takes away Medicaid, destroys our health care system, gets you or your loved one fired, closes more national parks, causes more plane crashes due to FAA cuts, and finally comes for your Social Security. 5:00 / []
Doge drain the swamp / []
DOGE is trying to help the U.S. government lose weight because it's obese AF. The U.S government is in denial, and the Democrats have a "feedism" fetiish while getting monetary benefits through kickbacks under the guise of helping NGO's and countries. Democrats are sick in the head. / []
Is Mr. Musk saying that those who support Ukraine in the defense of their country against Russia are traitors? It seems that he thinks Ukraine should just surrender so the killing will stop. / []
Another reason why the Dumbocrats would not do what Doge is doing is because they are LOW IQ and DEI / []
WOW Brett, this is the BEST most Consequential interview I’ve seen.  Thank you for giving these Patriots the platform to inform Americans about what’s really happening. / []
THANKU MR ELON MUSK! YOU AND DOGE TEAM ARE  AWESOME,,, TOM KRAUSE, JOE GEBBIA, ,ANTHONY ARMSTRONG, TYLER HASSAN, STEVE DAVIS,  ABRAM MOGHADDASSI BRAD SMITH,,  EACH OF YOU ARE PURE GOLD, MAGNIFICENT  PATRIOTS!!!  WE THE PEOPLE SALUTE YOU!!!!!  AND  HEROES OF ALL TIME, IN AMERICA!!!!! THANKU, THANKU, THANKU!!!! / ['🇺🇸👍👍🇺🇸😀']
Fantastic job keep moving with GOD speed. SEO / []
You had to ask how do we know if you are not taking from the government to make billions. How do we know. / []
32:48  Blackstone 😮 / []
Thank you Elon! / []
Why is the unelected immigrant leading this entire conversation? / []
Astonishing how this Country even ran...wow ....THANK YOU ELON AND DOGE MEMBERS ..!!!!! MAGA / []
Wonder of they checked GSA / []
I'm a government employee, I do my job proudly, and I'm more proud of what DOGE is doing, my salary and your tax dollar are justified. If I'm scared or will be mad if they accidently fired me? HELL NAAH!! / []
I guess the American Democratic voter wants to be lied to constantly and they have no problem with it it's kind of revealing / []
Can’t believe anyone with common sense would oppose this. / []
Yet the Democrats want the waste  how do Democrats All become millionaires from a job that pays only little over 150k. They get the job as middle class but leave the job millionaires. All of them. That's why they're screaming. / []
This should be shown in every Highschool eight to twelfth grade. / []
To all these people who are trying to help are country I say thank you / []
Incredible interview / []
This shouldn't just be a Fox Exclusive this should be an American Exclusive period 100% / []
Build cars,  go out from politics / []
America stands with Doge❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Wow... America is so lucky  🇺🇸 . You all deserve much better treatment for what you all are getting.  Thank you guys so much / []
Bravo to great American patriots! / []
ELON MUSK, WE LOVE YOU, SUPPORT YOU, AND PRAY FOR YOU! ❤❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯💯 / []
I truly appreciate DOGE. I think it should be continuous. Thank you Elon. / []
OMG       BILLIONS   FROM     NIH   40%  GOING TO  THE ALREADY  BILLIONS  ENDOWMENTS   - NO WONDER THE UNIVERSITIES  ARE  DEPENDING  ON FED FUNDS  AND BECOMING  BIAS POLITICAL  ACTIVISM     UNREAL!!!! / []
Love to see in the comments a democrats rebuttal to this haha / []
Cave. Yes . Hahahahahahahahahaha / []
Great interview. Thanks so very much! I hope that we can take these men at their word. / []
Elon is a wonderful man and what he is doing is  a wonderful way to share his great intelligence. God keep you safe from harmful evil doers. thank you with love from my heart / []
As a British citizen many of us over here in the UK wish we had a UK DOGE. / []
We are Soooooo lucky to have Elon Musk!  Many thanks to Elon and his team of patriots. / []
wonderful group of people, patriots! / []
Man the line of questioning seemed accusatory the whole time.  Why not ask questions from the heart of truth and what’s happening, not the lies the democrats are spewing.  Not a big BB fan / []
I love Elon musk / []
This was incredible! Every country/government should be so lucky to have such knowledge dedicated to improving the country 🙌 / []
THANK YOU  E  & YOUR AWESOME, HARDWORKING  DOGE TEAM  🇺🇸💙🇺🇸🙏❤️🙏 / []
President Trump and his administration are doing a phenomenal job.  MAGA 2028 🇺🇸 / []
Courage of conviction. Soon to be recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The highest honor a civilian can be given. / []
You guys are wonderful! Thank you, Bear / []
Thank You Elon & DOGE~!!!! / []
It's crazy how effective the leftist media are in their attempt to smear and make these guys the modern devils incarnates.... its really impressive how good the media is at gaslighting and directing the narrative.... i shoild be angry but I'm actual impressed / []
For a bunch of 19 year olds they seem to know what they're talking about. / []
Thanks Elon Musk group 🥰👍, saving taxpayers money for the future thanks again❤️!! / []
I'm so happy that our country is finally being ruled by the common sense. First time in decades, political initiatives are actually make sense. I hope we can preserve this attitude for many years to come! / []
Yea! Thanks to all of these Gentlemen. Bravo & God bless you all. / []
The reason why Elon musk has been so successful is because he has been truthful to everyone that is around him that works for him and they trust him to be a good person that is why he is so successful they know they can get nothing but the truth out of him whether they like it or not / []
Thank you, DOGE for all your doing for our country. God bless you all.❤🎉😊 / []
💯🎯✔️🇺🇸🆓🇱🇹🎩 / []
It is impossible to believe anything you’re saying because there are so many debunkable things said right in a row / []
Elon I just want to say thank you / []
Thank you Elon, thank you DOGE ! May Gd bless you all ! 🙏 / []
This is historic! DOGE, you rock! Thank you for bringing such a significant and revolutionary change to our government and our country. I believe your work and your sacrifices are making an amazing difference in our lives and in the lives of generations to come. God bless you! / []
why does musk lie / []
This is absolutely the truth . America wake up and listen / []

I salute to ELON MUSK . True lover of humanity and his country. THANK YOU ELON AND ALL OTHERS AT DOGE / []
Well done / []
The whole team that came out Dodge they have came out to let America know what's going on including Elon Musk on the Fox News so there is no excuse people stop listening to the left they do not have no reason to lie to you the Republicans they are doing their job Democrats of the one still raising hell for no reason😮 / []
So who's getting the $$$ for these dead people's checks? / []
Hell yea go after the left wing media, sick of their fear mongering / []
I have not heard so much common sense in 40 minutes since my wonderful wife of 54 years passed away in 2017. 🙂 / []
How does Elon go before fox to explain what we can't see but yet reject going before Congress to explain how much and what exactly has been cut.. I'm truly beginning to regret my vote for trump because it's business as usual in DC and transparency is no different than the last administration the lies the misleading the deceit is all the same / []
How ironic is it that the government that forces audits on private companies cannot pass an audit themselves? / []
Yeah America which this fox news love fest. Easy questions. Like trump does. / []
I'm smiling with cool joy. / []
80 year old women are.the ones exploding  up cars because their afraid they might not get there check. Do you think we are that stupid shame on you Brett these men are risking a lot to open themselves to you. / []
We need a new mountain…so we can carve all of you into history as the great American rebirth…….along with  PRESIDENT TRUMP… / []
The Dumbocrats could NOT have initiated what Doge is doing because it is not in their best interest.   They are criminals and corrupt. / []
I support Elon Musk. ✨️✨️🇺🇲✨️✨️ / []
I can't believe the DOGE team is even happening! It's like when Captain Kirk ended up in the alternate universe. / []
One of the best interviews I have ever seen. Fair, balanced and accurate. / []
.15??? That's all? / []
I think even Elon is shocked @ the amount of waist😅 / []
All I can say is wow 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Is it just me or did all these blokes sound the same? / []
They will be heroes in our history books one day / []
W Musk, great mind, great patriot.. / []
Do you know BS when you see it? / []
I can only think that the original men creating our constitution…in essence our country must have been much like this group of men.  Brilliant, dedicated, focused.  I cannot state how wonderful, how impactful and significant this will be for all of us and those who follow us.  Do not let the pip squeaks deter you…with their hateful tantrums and obvious lies. / []
Just look at how they are all acting that speaks for it self / []
God bless the DOGE team!!! / []
My dad said we jumped a dimension or something when talking bout this because the amount of change we’re seeing ❤ / []
Is anyone else hearing the weird crying or dog whining in the background, mostly toward the end? / ['yes…was looking for a comment about this….weird']
Thanks to these guys clearing out the VA, my claim....that sat idle for all of 2024, was expedited. 3 months of this change, and my claim is finalized, and I get help after 16 years. And then coming on air, and doing this?! These gentlemen are patriots. / []
Long Live Elon Musk!  You are America's Hero. / []
We need to get some of this money back. / []
Im so thankful somebody finally stepped up and has the guts to stop the bleeding of americans tax dollars. Just wish they could do it on a state level too. / []
Every  American needs to watch this no matter what side of the aisle you are on. / []
INTERESTING      SINCE  2008  ELECTIONS      15  MILLION  " MARKED AS ALIVE"    HOW MANY OF THOSE  ALIVE   100+ YR OLDS   VOTED   IN 2008   AND  2020????????????????????!!!!!! / []
Awesome info! / []
What an awesome team! Thank you all for everything you are doing for America. / []
Except Elon, they are speaking nervously- calm down slow down with deep voice shows power.. u reader try this next time for your public speaking😂 / []
Shout out to the last four Presidents, not including President Trump, 'You overlooked a big part of doing your job.' Repent. The kingdom of heaven has come near to you. Elon DOGE support / []
The democrats spin this into bad? It's really unbelievable. / []
This needs to be mandatory viewing for all Americans. The Democratic Party is full of contemptible liars who are attempting to scare people in order to prevent reform! Why? I think largely because they can't claim credit for it. Also, their incompetence and indifference will be exposed (let's see, from 2008 to 2024 who was in charge the vast majority of the time?) But the outright lying from amoral egotists like Chuck Schumer is disgusting to witness. / []
love what elon+trump are doing / []
3 years from now you all will see. Do you really think they give a crap about you? Oh there thinking of the American hard working people! Think people. When have they ever thought about anything but their own pockets. / []
Can these guys go do this same interview on NBC or ABC? No liberals are even going to watch this. / []
Thank you for this.  I learned and understand so much more.  God bless you all and keep you safe. / []
OH MY- THIS TEAM IS SO MISUNDERSTOOD! I SWEAR I SAW A LOOK ALIKE OF ELON MUSK SAYING THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IS A PONZI SCHEME. I EVEN HEARD OF SOME HUGE MISTAKES THAT DOGE HAD MADE BY FIRING ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES WORKING FOR THE NUCLEAR WASTE DEPARTMENT, BUT THE CUTS BEING MADE ARE BEING DONE SURGICALLY NOT WITH A POWER SAW. YOU SHOULD TESTIFY TO CONGRESS AND BRING ALL THIS EVIDENCE YOU SPEAK OF SO CITIZENS ACROSS AMERICA CAN STOP PROTESTING IN EVERY STATE, JUST A SUGGESTION / []
I'm a democrat and really enjoyed watching this. Elon and his crew are so articulate. The most clear governmental conversation I've ever seen. Glad he is in this role. We need all people at their best! / []
THANK YOU ELON / []
If these federal agencies are not obligated to pass an audit can I just stick my middle finger up If I get one? This is maddening. / []
❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Elon and others, thank you for your work. Elon you are correct about mark Kelly, no solutions, young people dying. And for those who want to feed to war, you are traitors to this country, and your evil. / []
Great report!✨️🇺🇸✨️ / []
What an amazing people 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
The Magnificent Eight! More power to these guys. Keep it going!! Democrats are so stupid even if they watch this they won't understand the language being used! 😂 / []
Not what I expected. This is better than I expected. Thank-you to these Patriots / []
Their ability to answer every question with so much detail is awesome!!!! / []
LFG DOGE! THANK YOU, ELON! ALL OF THE DOGE TEAM, THANK YOU! MAGA / []
Thank you!❤ / []

I could NOT turn my eyes away from this INFORMATIVE VIDEO. You OWE it to YOURSELF & OUR COUNTRY TO WATCH IT. / ['💯💯💯🙏🙏 Amen 🙏🙏💯💯💯']
It is the Main Stream Media Stoking Anarchy It is the Main Stream Media Publishing Propaganda It is the Main Stream Media engaging in False Reporting of Facts It is the Main Stream Media that Is a Democrat. / []
No free advice but yes communication and connectivity gaps…..???? Musk can saves Tesla and ……??? / []
Give this man a Bell's!!! MAGA!!! / []
This was inspiring to watch / []
Very positive comments, I would genuinely wonder what the opposition to anything stated here would be? Do people think they are just lying? If so then to what end? / []
Should have been the most watched today / []
I'm not surprised.  Look at another shady industry THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.  Look at how dusty B.M.I's website is.... / []
They call us the silent majority but if you listen carefully, you can hear the Real APPLAUSE for this DREAM TEAM.  It's drowning out all the crying from the impressionable and rudderless lost souls that are out there complaining.   Please keep your eye on the ball and keep up the Good Work Doge.   We the people see you and sincerely thank you! 👍👍 / []
Democrats destroyed America with their spending / []
This is the amount of honesty and transparency the American people need 34:01! / []
Excellent interview.  Really grateful and impressed with the DOGE team.  I am increasing in admiration of Elon Musk as far as his character and values.  The individual interview with Musk was powerful for me.  He is absolutely right...there IS Evil out there. / []
Why is this happening on FOX and not in Congress? Why haven't these people testified under oath? I hope what they are saying is true, but at this point it's just talk. / ['Very good question']
The so-called mainstream journalist should be covering what Doge has uncovered, but they are NOT, WHY?????????????????? / []
Every single one of these men is a patriot.  Thank you, Mr. Musk and team.  What an extraordinary sacrifice they are making to serve Americans.  Thank you, President Trump and his cabinet.  I find this to be so inspiriting that it brings tears to my eyes.  God bless you all.  God bless America. / []
Why do these Nazis sound so nervous? / []
What an exceptional group of guys. They love the country…it’s so obvious. / []
Outright lies. They know for a fact there are not 15 million people "marked as alive" that are 120 or older and there are zero dollars going to anyone claiming to be 120. / []
thank you gentlemen for all your  great service to our country! / []
What a great interview. Thx FOX!!!! / []
Why are not these "I DON'T KNOW", People  arrested in the government? / []
Thank you all  .. .. hopefully these Democrats who committed corruption be prosecuted. / []
Trump 2028 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! / []
6.25 million for improving respect in the work place....... 12.2 million for worker empowerment in south America..... / []
Elon Musk is a national treasure / []
Elon is Americas real life, Iron Man. It’s crazy we live in a time where there’s an actual human being. Who’s approaching a comic book level of influence in creativity and look at how people are treating him. / []
that was incredible / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE!! You all are America's superheroes!! / []
Fantastic future. Fantastic voyage. / []
Love these guys!!!! / []
Who's crying in the background / []
I love efficiency! / []
Thank you, Elon Musk and the DOGE team. This is an incredibly important work you're doing! / []
Excellent interview. These men, along with President Trump and some of his cabinet are our heroes. They will go down in history as such. God Bless them RICHLY. / []
🤡🇺🇸 / []
That's love for Humanity. Elons love go far beyond his richness. It's not rocket science to LOVE. / []
This is transparency. / []
Thank God for this man! / []
Great team, of guys . / []
This group of men are absolutely heroes patriots and so unselfishly devoting their lives. Shameful how Democrats that demonized these great men! / []
Amazing interview 👏 / []
which one is big balls? / []
Just amazing information.  Amazing that these great minds, are collaborating so well. / []
Who wouldn't support cutting waste . Especially if you love your country.I dont think they are taking away necessary dollars to citizens that has been allocated. / []
Please help USPS with the RRECS this system doesn't work correctly.  Using cell system instead of satellite for communication with post offices and most drop service.  This is rural mail carriers pay.  Our pay is based 94 percent on this failed programming. / []
WHY do people hate this man?  WHAT has he done but try to reverse (REAL not FAKE) corruption, waste, theft, abuse, and wickedness.  Thank You Lord Jesus for what YOU are doing through these men.   YOU are the One who raises up kings, and pulls them down again.    l pray for their salvation Oh Lord.  To YOU be the GLORY!  ~   AMEN! / []
10 million for gender equity in the mexican work place??? What in the actual F does that mean?? / []
The presidents plan is the only plan for peace. No body else is talking about bringing the conflict to a end. Literally no body. / []
We support President Trump. / []
That's a bunch of creepy individuals. Well, let's hope veterans won't get messed over any further by this group of...  .....aaah, let's call 'em people 😅 / ['@DutchWeazel Have you been to the VA in the last four years? It took me 6 months to see my primary after making the appointment. That was a year ago.']
Good job Elon and Doge Team.... from canada!   I hope my canadian goverment would have DOGE team soon... / []
Well, if the government can’t pass on it, neither can I because they have no idea what’s coming or going, so how can you determine what I’m doing? / []
Thank you so much! You are like the founding fathers, and we all owe you a debt of gratitude!!! / []
This isn’t just a Democrat issue. It’s been going on for many many years. The American people have been duped. Shame on all of you for not doing the right thing for years n years. Doge team is doing a great job. Thank you for loving America and her people. God Bless each of you. / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE!!!  You all seem to be a great group of gentlemen!!!!  USA!!!!  USA!!!!!  USA!!!!!!❤ / []
Hence paper trail. Can we do better with computer trail we r traburning ourselves to pinish the bad / []
Dusty Dems advocate for archaic systems bc yeah that makes sense / []
Did he say precocious 9 month old 😂 / []
Total lack of respect for human life. / []
40% fraudsters calling retirees absolutely! / []
I wish the Trump administration would purchase some prime time TV to broadcast this to the american people. / []
History in the making. / []
Elon is a hero and what he is doing with DOGE shows he is a true patriot...May God bless him and his team...:) / []
Fantastic, keep up your great work... / []
Is evil attracted to elon?  Or does elon incite evil in people? Lord have mercy on our souls..... / []
🫶 / []
Elon that’s not John Stewart what’s the hold up? / []
Remember when Dems used to strongly tell us " WORDS ARE VIOLENCE !!! " / []
All this and he says nothing about what he did. And had to undo cause this is crap. Stop believing people. Get off your knees. / []
Excellent video.  I support the panel on social security.  Thanks and God Bless. / []
Thank you,TEAM DOGE! Love and appreciate your efforts! / []
So glad we voted for Trump. Good things are happening. / []
Wow, EVERYONE should watch this many times!  This is crazy what our government is doing.  smh  / []
God bless you and your team this is what make America great is all about real Patriots and real caring instead of Democrats stuff in their pocket / []
Good work thanks / []
Anytime the communist-democrats accuse president Trump and or Musk—whatever it is they accuse them of is precisely what they have been doing for longer than 4 years! / []
This is what competent leadership can achieve. 👏 / []

Just AWESOME!!!Thankyou ELON and DOGE CREW !!! we pray for all of y'all - families n friends too!!! MAGA!!! MAHA!!! (RFK may need your help as well) Blessings for all! / []
Wow open heart surgery on a national scale / []
"We're All doomed!." is statement i just can't believe its something Musk personally believes tho. I doubt he thinks he's part of the "we're". / []

For decades, democrats have set animosity between the American businesses/enterprises and the public, forgetting that “the business is the American way”. The business is what keeps the economy going and operates the government. Without the business there would be no employment. It’s a simple mechanism that defines the economy and the strength of the country. No logic involved. All are common sense. But seems as if even the common sense ideas are complex logic for illiterate democrats.   To bring back the American pride and treasures, you have to enhance the businesses and provide them every opportunity to grow and expand and be productive and successful. When companies rise, the employees rise along. The businesses create jobs and eliminate the unemployment. But even that much is too much for democrats to comprehend.   For those Democrats who are hindering and preventing the businesses from prospering, must be subjected to the medieval systems of justice. That is my decree for democrats. / []
Incredible raw emotion from Elon at the end. / []
is it just me reading body language too much or do every single president, prime minster and goverment worker stutter at every sentence fkn fools think where stupid we know when people lie and are chatting absoulte shite / []
God Bless all of these men for their patriotism and heroism!!  So much criticism from the left and the media without even knowing what DOGE is doing and the importance of what they are doing for the survival of the USA!  Thank you President Trump!! / []

This is exactly what the American people need to hear. How much is ACTUALLY BEING WASTED.. your tax dollars. After watching this... I'm thinking  Elon Musk for President after Trump in 4 years. The days of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are over. Old school ways don't work in 2025. Some of these politicians should be prosecuted for stealing the tax payers money. Im 62 years old and have never seen this in my lifetime. Young people are waking up to the truth of their politicians. / []
Its just incredible what they are doing. I hope we can achieve similar in the UK. / []
They should be able to GET MORE MONEY! / []
DOGE has currently saved tax payers over 250 billion and counting.  Thats awesome!! / []

Excellent job of humanizing the work you are doing. Truly historic times. / []
this has been a gap since the government started using computers. / []
The US can just print money, not many countries can do that / []
This is passion. True passion. They don’t need this. They are self made billionaires. They have money to last for hundreds of years, and generations over generations. Yet, they get attacked every day. For what? Trying to fix this country? If they don’t fix this nobody will. We sat with the hope that the past governments will fix this and yet look where we ended up. The closest we will ever be to a financial bankruptcy. As, they said , very soon we won’t have a country if we can’t redress from the financial ruin we are currently in. It seems like the left is pro bankrupting this country because anyone in their right mind will join DOGE in their effort to cut our deficit. Seeing the last seconds of the interview and Musks expression when asked about Ukraine and thousands of people being killed there for nothing gave me chills… as to how visibly moved he was … that hit deep with me and very visibly so with him 😢😢😢😢😢😢.

These men just continue to repeat talking points and assume that we should just hand over the keys and allow them to dictate all govt spending.

Medicare (Correction, it was United Healthcare, and Medicare plan F) had my dad on two different programs simultaneously for several months before it was found out. To the tune of over $2,000 overcharge. They refuse to pay him back and he has spent months trying to get to one program. I spent over 20 hours in phone calls, many many workers, including 2 supervisors and they still did not straighten it in. In the meantime neither program would pay his bills because of the other one. Finally after 6 months he told them he would get a lawyer. Their response was to purge his record. I am stunned at what they have put this 97 year old man through, the money he has lost and the stress both my parents have had to endure ( my mother is 94). This has traumatized them. Thank you Doge team and President Trump for tackling this nightmare government mess! / ["This all began when my mother tried to use the advantage stipend card they were alotted for personal items purchased. Walgreens pharmacist was rude and said she had zero balance, so she put it on credit card. Later the statement from Advantage showed he was paid and her credit card statement showed the same amount for the same day. Advantage refused to listen and was also rude to her and said she has zero balance and I believe hung up on her, even though she told them she had a receip from both that matched. This is what led them to go back to the F plan, when they discovered that my dad was never disenrolled when they enrolled him in advantage. They have deep regrets from listening to the smooth talking salesman that got them to switch in the first place. The same guy that they could never get in touch with again. Beware of switching to the Advantage plan. It doesn't cover what you think it will. Don't fall into the nightmare my parents did, please!", 'I am not American citizen... but I mention my lawyer and/or press in 5th minute if discussion with state comesars.\nThats the only language they understand world wide.', "As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!\r\n\rReagan wanted to remove Medicare back in the 1980s. He opposed the liberal incision in the 1960s as it would bankrupt the country, which we know is false.\nThere is a fascinating political dilemma in the Democratic Party right now. Do they go with a Shapiro-Whitmore ticket or Sanders -AOC? Both groups polled well, with independents and Democratic voters claiming they are sick and tired of the soft approach to Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party. That's why they recently polled poorly in Gallup. They have 74% independent voters. \nSources:\nBBC World\nNews\nReuters", 'United Healthcare isn’t part of the government it’s a private company', '\u200b@prollytired2329 It was United Healthcare and Medicare part F.']

I support what he's doing, but 130 days * $4 billion in waste reduced = only 520 billion dollars, not 1000 billion dollars. / []
Thank you Elon Musk & the group of men helping you in DOGE to help America & American Taxpayers!!! We appreciate you!!! / []
Thank you DOGE / []
I'll put my money on Elon over Mark Kelly anytime / []
THE PURPOSE OF DOGE IS TO GET RID OF AMERICAN SERVICES AND GIVE THAT MONEY TO THE RICH / []
Thank you for fighting for the prosperity of our country. / []
Thanks to these men 🙌  God bless them, and they are real Americans! Helping even dumb democrats to have a future even though they don't want it... / []
Wow thank you Elon and the team ❤ / []
Thank you DOGE🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Elon is my hero. I absolutely do not understand why anyone would have a problem with what he is doing.  It is insane the way he's being treated.  Anyone with any common sense appreciates what he's doing. Him and his band of warriors. Elon Elon he's our man if he can't do it noone can. This from a 66yr old mamaw of 7 in Fairborn Ohio. / []
the guy with the piercing blue eyes is the most confident and believable (duh) / []
Will all these white men gain  financially? / []
This is Common sense, the fact Elon is being attacked is crazy. He is cutting at the Democrat slush fund and they are madddddd!!!!!! / []
Ask not what your country can do for you, but for what you can do for your country. Redefining “public servants” / []
Thank you Brett for sharing this with us and providing some insight into Doge. I pray they will be able to have a lasting positive impact on our countries financial predicament. Hopefully this begins a movement that carries across the globe. / []
This was one of the most interesting and educational things I have ever seen on the internet. Thanks Mr Musk and entire DOGE Team. All of America needs to watch this. / []
I'm thinking it really got abused the last four years because of biden and his mental decline / ["You're an absolute idiot."]
True American love Elon musk / []
Fox is just state run media. The full propaganda arm of the trump admin. Disgusting / []
You gentlemen have just reinforced how very proud I am to be an American.  Thank you so much! / []
I'll bet no Democrat is watching this. I'll bet no democratic voters are watching this. / []
Thank you DOGE Team! / []
This makes me crave my comeback as a citizen, go america!! I may be in EU but 20 years in America i still have love, and i have been TRUMP since all of my friends at a bbq started laughing at me said "hillary duhhhh".. i said.. "nah 2016 trump... trump it HAS to be.".  This is very patriotic, congratulations all of America. A great start, thanks Musk and the DOGE team! +whole MAGA movement. / []
MDHHS systems don't speak to eachother either... or people aren't using them. Not sure which. / []
It should be mandatory for Brainwashed indoctrinated Democrats to watch this story!!! He is an intellectual not seen for but few  generations / []
Why do they have to stop at $1T?  Can't they go further?  They should never leave! / []
Bad stewards of the American peoples money. / ["If they don't fix it...they aren't worth anything...rich people know money. Want a homeless person doing it or you with your 86 IQ lmao I doubt you would even know where to start"]
Yeah the demon rats were the ones trying to ruin it all along. With all their outragous wasteful spending it most defenetly would have shut down eventually. Idiot demons lieing to America. / []
He’s on drugs again. / []
I'll keep saying it . Keep up the good work Elon !!!!!!!!! / []
I stand with a Elon and America's team / []
just because you're a decorated veteran or hero doesn't mean you can't be a scoundrel at the same time. and MK is a scoundrel / []
Tax dollars was like running water to the Dems 🌊💲🤲🛩️⛱️✈️🏰 / []
Go DOGE / []
Oh my God blessed USA Elon Musk saved American working thank you so much teamwork Elon ❤ / []
Wow this is my second time watching this amazing interview. But im not surprised with what im hearing. I vote and im neither party i wear no labels. I make my decision by listening to the person that seeks my vote. I listen to the media but the media doesn't influence my decision making. I could not under any circumstances vote for Joe Biden or his side kick. / []
Thanks Elon and Team DOGE! ❤❤❤ / []
They care about America and the people. They aren't taking any salary. Elon isn't wanting any salary  They are getting too close to the corrupt judges. / []
God's Soldiers!!!! / []
Elon is MAGA 🐸❤️🇺🇲 / []
This is absolutely AMAZING  HOW FORTUNATE ARE WE THAT ELON MUSK & DOGE ARE WILLING TO SAVE AMERICA ❓❗❗❗❗❗🙏🇺🇸♥️🇺🇲 / []
We've all been robbed and we should be marching on Washington at this point demanding a paycheck. / []
These men need medals 🎖️ / []
You might need to bring a  film crew to show how they work. Show actual footage of what they are finding, actual screen shots / []
Simply Amazing / []
What a bunch of fraudsters! / []
Clean the corrupt mess up Elon, thank you. / []
Great job explaining everything Elon and the Doge team! 🇺🇸🚀 / []
The Rothschilds are a pan-European Jewish family, who take their name from the house of their 16th century ancestors, 'zum roten Schild' (at the sign of the red shield), in Frankfurt's Jewish ghetto. / []
I love Elon even more after watching this! Amazing! / []
Non-zero chance of success, but still small. Need to overcome a lot of obstacles - never stop pushing. / []
The mine is insane!!! Talk about old systems in place! 😂 that’s just crazy!! / []
Thank you ☺️ / []
God Bless Elon and the team. / []
im glad biden cheated because trumps first term was great but with a hand tied behind his back because he was told who to put in with him. his second term he has full hands on deck and people backing him up and trusts / []
This Is What Every Adult American That Can Vote Needs To See...  Very Clear... Very Concise...  Facts & Truth...  In Plain Simple Terms...  Common Sense... / []
THANK YOU DOGE!!! someone that loves my USA!!!  Keep the pressure up!! Next we need to stop all the growth management in health care....... before long the people will not be able to afford anything!! Doc reimbursement  needs to go up so we can continue to recruit  the best doctors that will stay in private practice. Then can we have DOGE come to colorado .... tons of FAW!!!!!! / []
😈 Brett B. Sucks @ interviewing.  😈 Listen to the dumb questions that he is asking these DOGE men.  There is  no substantial l follow-up questions.  That's why DJT didn't REALLY want Brett to interview him.  He's BORING & definitely part of the establishment.  ((Of course he is -- he's w/FOX.)) Those silently DJT Haters.  We see You, goofy 😜 Brett. / []
Elon and the team are making America Great Again!...For sure!  Thank you Elon. And DOGE Team.  MAGA / []
Long overdue / []
"Elementary financial control" / []
Thank u Mr Musk & team / []
I will never own an electric car. Living and working here in the silicon valley I see Tesla cars all around me and I cringe! But if folks wanna buy them and drive them, its thier freedom to do so. I think Elon musk is a brilliant man and a true patriot of this country! MAGA! / []
Well done. / []
Thank you Doge for what you are doing / []
DOGE and Trump together is a crazy combination. Get the money back to the people and it will be cool. If not, nobody's going to believe nothing y'all just said. / []
Of course they’re not going to completely erase the deficit, but if they can even come close to achieving what he claims is the goal, that would be groundbreaking. / []
💪😇 THANK YOU ELON . WE SUPPORT ALL YOUR DOING SIR / []
GREETINGS FROM TEXAS WITH PRAYERS.....WE ARE WITH YOU MR. MUSK. / []
These are a group of true patriots providing a massively expansive and priceless service to save government services and our country. Thank God Trump won. / []
Check out the American Eagle seal in the background facing the arrows. 🤔 / []
Great and fantastic jobs DOGE team ! Thank you 🙏🏽 your guys wonderful work efforts. The Whole Nation of American are thankful and appreciate! / []
Absolute patriots!!! The founding fathers gave up their lives for this country, and they are doing the same. / []

Wow, this is mind-blowing,  Thank you, DOGE Team. This department should have existed, and every state should have one. Master piece by Brett! History will remember Elon as the founding father of DOGE!! / []
Engineers at work / []
If you put a team of pizza delivery guys in leadership positions, the result will be better than from this bunch of Trump idiots. / []
So glad the goods prevailing 🎉❤ / []
Sure seems like Democrats are liars and distorting the truth. What does this say about each of those Democrats that are exploiting the lie to the American public? / []
They care about America and the people. They aren't taking any salary. Elon isn't wanting any salary / []
"The Untouchables" in a modern version!!! / []
FANTASTIC interview!  Thank you to the DOGE TEAM and BRETT. / []
Unfortunately Americans will be grateful and thankful years from now as they are currently on the left very busy with TDS 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ Thank you D.O.G.E. for saving Americas bank account 🙏🇺🇸 and therefore future ❤ / []

Everyone Share please 🙏 / []
"NERRRDDSSSSS" THANK YOU DOGE you guys are amazing / []
Defragmenting.... / []
USA in self destruction mode. / []
Ok but you don’t need to layoff everyone and totally dismantle crucial departments!  Be careful what you do!! / []
This needed to be done. / []
PayPal mafia captured the USA. SAVE AMERICA. / []
Airbnb totally sold out on people / []
At this point every government payment needs to be halted for the next 90 days to ensure it is valid. This includes government salaries. I know that sounds harsh, but there's just too much sketchy crap going on in the government that we've always known has existed, but this just proves it / []
this is pre scripted / ['😂😂 keep drinking that kool aid 😂😂']
💪😇 THE DEMOCRATIC OFFICIAL S THAT ARE ALWAYS LIEING TO THE PUBLIC ( MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE ) AND PROSECUTED FOR SLANDER AND LIEING TO THE PUBLIC . WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS ANY MORE . WE ARE DONE WITH THESE ( LIMP WRISTED  ) IGNORANT LOST SOULS THAT HAVE NO TRUTH IN THEM . REPENT 💪 / []
Did all this outrageous spending happen because several bills were voted on at the same time under one bill, instead of evaluating them individually? Thank you team for investigating and repairs, transparency and courage too. / []
Absolutely love this! EVERYBODY needs to see this. DOGE is doing a tremendous job, but sadly, and unfortunately, it is a thankless job.   These men are sacrificing much, and even putting their lives on the line, thanks to evil leftists. God bless our President; God bless DOGE. / []
These guys are so smart, the US is lucky. / []
Good bless Elon, and the DOGE team!! This is what America should be nothing but truth because all they have done is hide the truth, steal from the people and enrich the government.!! And when I mean, enrich the government, I mean, enrich senators, Congress people like everyone says they never built anything. They just steal from the people that built it all.!!! / []
Great interview thank you ❤ / []
FOX will be liable for propping up this idiot. / ['Keep those thoughts 💭, are just keep drinking that kool aid']
34:20 I am Glad to hear this. / []
My cousin send me this vid.  I think. Your channel is stupid. Ur stupid n you promote stupidity / []
To all Democrats watching this video.   We're on to you.  This is one of the reasons you didn't want Trump in the White House. 😮 / []
democrats are money thieving traitors / []
Elon's team was so great working for safe Americans's life. / []
But which one of them is Big Balls? / []
Musk is lying / []
Thank you Elon Musk and DOGE for the great service to our Country 🇺🇲 / ['We have to carry on after Trump and after Musk. Eternal global fight against trillion-dollar thieves who create diversions with race/gender.

Elon is cleaning up the swamp / []
This was so informative and so interesting to finally see the people working with Elon.  No small potatoes. / []
Beautiful work!!!! Thank you gentlemen!!!🙏🙏🙏👏❤️😊 / []
SO when DOGE makes all these cuts, what is the plan for upgrading / updating systems in the future. This cannot be a one time issue, there needs to be a process for continuous integration / continuous deployment as we say in Tech. / []
Taking down America  Bottom line ............... / []
7 horsemen / []
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts ELON & DOGE!!! Our POTUS surrounds himself with greatness!! Love & Hugs to ALL OF YOU!! Congrats on your new bundle of joy Elon 🔥🙌🏽🔥🩵👍🏽💪🏽🥂 / []
Where is Big Balls? / []
where is black and brown folks helping?!!!! / []
Elon Musk and his buddies follow Curtis Yarvin. He believes federal government should be dismantled and replaced with a technocratic king. / []
They're like the 21st Century Ultra Founding Fathers. 💲🪙🙏🇺🇸❤️🇺🇲 The Golden Age Founding Fathers.      💲🪙🙏 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇲 / []
Wow the American retirement process is in a cave so it's like as advanced as the Flintstones😂 in a way. Good thing Elon found this and can modernize antiquiticated systems. The government is obviously not with the times. This could be ok in Cuba for example where they don't have money to do anything, but in America, this is a joke. / []
More of this please! Thanks for bringing us along on a journey! They are modernizing government software! / []
And since Trump is so transparent we should believe you Musk because you say things so seriously 😂😂😂😂 yeah right! / []
God bless Elon Musk, D.O.G.E. personnel, and President Trump.  Press on! / []
1 trillion is not enough good grief that’s crazy / []
Just a statement / []
People trying to stop these folks from helping should be ashamed of themselves. This is an amazing endeavor. / []
I wish Elon would quit hogging  up all the Joy 🌈&💙 Tolerance and give others a chance to  agitate the underworld ✴️🇺🇸✌🏾 / []
I envy the USA to have great cabinet and team like DOGE. Please bear in mind, they do not have to do this but they do it anyway. Amazing! / []
I like how Elon explained the position on the war , its a hard one to put out there. / []
Thank you gentlemen. / []
He's not wrong . He's learning from south African culture. Because he's one of the assholes that made the bribery and corruption in the first place in africa / []
Elon ❤❤❤ / []
simple math: 4 billion, times 130 days is 520billion...... not 1 trillion @ElonMusk / ['Learn more\r\n520 billion is approximately 52% or 0.52 of 1 trillion because 1 trillion is equal to 1,000 billion']
was there a dog whining backstage towards the end of the interview??😂 / []
Doge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉 / []
I appreciate what DOGE is doing God Protect Them 🙏 / []
I actually enjoyed this. this was a real good watch, and I do NOT like FOX at all. This was really good. / []
Every citizen should watch and understand what’s happening rather watching headlines from biased media outlets / []
Stupid question in my opinion to ask WHY THESE GENTLEMEN IS DOUNG THIS? Some people hate corruption, like me😊 / []
AWESOME 👏🏽 / []
Salute to DOGE TEAM 🏆🏆🏆 / []
There is no business anywhere that would run if they couldn’t pass an audit.  But the government has for many years.  It’s so wrong. / []
Fantastic interview Mr Elon Musk and DOGE team. Thank you for your great support for the American people . Bravo 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯 / ["As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings. His overall approval rating was *43%**, with **53% disapproving* of his performance. On specific issues:\r\n\r\n- **Economy**: 41% approval, 59% disapproval.\r\n- **Foreign Affairs**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Environmental Policies**: 41% approval.\r\n- **Energy Policy**: 45% approval, 47% disapproval.\r\n- **Relations with Russia**: 39% approval.!"]
Fantastic interview. Go Doge ❤ / []
Nope, not bear. Dislike / []
Every American needs to watch this interview, especially those whom have fallen for the misinformation spewed from the Democrats and legacy media. / []
I think that them taking all the money and acting like fool  sad we have to share the earth with you guys / []
❤Elon u have a beautiful heart & thankyou for what ur doing! / []
Massive sensitization of the ordinary and shallow people is the best strategy to the lies and fear-mongering spewed by the criminal democrats and fraudsters. / []
I think this is great but who is providing requirements for how these systems and workflows are to work?  I mean... I'm a QA Test "Executive" - which just means I've done software testing for a VERY long time. If these guys are trying to fix these problems then they're going to need real requirements and workflow definitions.  So far... all I keep hearing is "We'll fix these problems with better designs." Those designs must be based on business requirements, workflow and clearly defined use cases.  Further... since these will effect government systems that impact... well... EVERYBODY. They're going to need to comply with ISO standards and I'm not just talking 9001. Anyway. I like what they're doing and I definitely am all for it.  I'm just curious about this piece because I've seen way too many times that people take on designing and engineering a software system that doesn't actually do what those who will in the end be using it because they weren't consulted. This is more of a question than a rant. Sorry if it sounds like a rant. It isn't. / []
We need this / []
So give us our money back / []
God bless you all / []
May the Lord continue to bless that team and creating a more prosperous and safe United States of America 🙏🙏🙏 / []
DJT wins! With Dodge. Winning / []
Semper Fi!! / []
And there you go.. you become losable by digitization. / []
Social security is socialism giving trillions to my friends in the military industrial complex is just good for me I have stock in most of their companies as does Donald. Poor people should just suck it…. / []
I love Elon Musk. I truly believe he is a good man. President Trump and team, you are the best.👍💯 🙏🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻 / []
I wish they would get this on billboards and all the tools they used during the election, the web site is great, but let’s bombard the Internet, TV, Radio, advertising, all of it. / []
DODGE - we can't Thank You enough for what you are doing for our country - and ultimately for our planet. An economically strong US (w/digitally integrated systems that can communicate w/each other) is much more capable at helping the world. / []
This was a great interview. I hope liberals realize the messaging is from the heart and they are helping the nation not all the crap thrown out to scare people / []
Great informational interview. / []
I hope elon stays on longer / []
Thank you DOGE team! / []
🇺🇸Thank you all from Houston! God bless you, god bless America and god bless Texas! We have to figure out the way to have liberals in to watching this information.🇺🇸 / []
Why doesn't he answer questions straight up, not dodge how many days / []
Since 2008! Oh, who was taking over the WH?! / []
Elon Musk is doing wonderfully!! / []
Don’t really follow you Brent but good interview and good questions thanks for showing respect for a true patriot. Balance is everything. TRUTH!! / []
THE PURPOSE OF DOGE IS TO FOOL PEOPLE INTO THINKING THE GOVT IS CORRUPT SO TRUMP CAN BECOME A DICTATOR / []
👊✌️ / []
I just figured it out… If Elon can do this for America and it works, He has created himself a trillion dollar industry by government auditing. He’s a genius. / []
It's really irrelevant what Mark Kelly's "prior accomplishments" are, Brett.  A traitor is a traitor. / []
You all need to come to maine / []
Thank you Gentlemen, from the bottom of our hearts!! Each of you, Outstanding human beings!! Thank you!!🙏 / []
What a great team thank you / []
While all the legislators are galavanting around town drinking. / []

Where  are the specifics on what exactly was cut ,actual dollar savings and how was the residual work load distributed among remaining employees / []
God bless all of you for what you are doing.  Thank you! / []
But the information on the DOGE site information is not correct. That’s why they had to take the information down. / []
Make Government efficient again / []
Thank you all for your sacrifices to save this country, what you are doing has no sides, it’s for all Americans! / []
Thank you Elon musk / []
Well Elon your dollar based so your only the richest man in the world ,if you speak with a American accent. / []
You can tell they are lying through their teeth. Anyone with an ounce of critical thinking should be able to fact check them. The paper copies can’t be hacked gentlemen. There was no problem with social security until they showed up. / []
Taking food out of the mouths of demacrats.😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 / []
That’s how close to bankruptcy! / []
The  democrats  think  that this money is theres! It is not,it belongs to the people! / []
Brett, you didnt ask the question, have any of these “fraudsters” been arrested?  we need to see some “perf walk” / []
The crooks have eat somehow.  Other crimes will go up as a result of this crackdown. / []
Almost none of the information that most media outlets and Democratic leaders have shared about DOGE is congruent with what has been revealed during this interview of the people doing the actual work- anyone surprised? / []
Im greatful for elon musk / []
I hope we get    more money 956. A month     doesn't go far. They should go and do all the banks see all the cheating going on God bless us and God bless you all and Trump and Elon and there family's all the men and women in uniform. / []
LIES, LIES, and MORE LIES. Don't believe a word he's saying. They have PROOF that he is lying. / []
Why he doesn't go back to Africa, and fix Africa 😅😅😅 / []
Some of these frauds are fixing to lose all their funds 😅😅😅😅 this will go down in history / []
God bless these people! / []
I stand with President Trump AND DOGE/Elon.  If you oppose, not only are you a complete moron, but you are, in fact, on the wrong side of history.  Admittedly looking quite stupid while at it. / []
Should’ve been doing this from Day 1 / []
😭😭😭😭😭🙏❤️ thank you all for your good work for our country and our future gens!!!  God bless you! / []
Get this out to AMERICA!!! 🇺🇸🙏 / []
The collective brain power among the DOGE team is off the charts. / []
Thank you Bret and FOX for airing this. I hope all Americans watch this. God bless🙏🏻. / ["Mainstream media won't run it.

This is why I voted for Trump/Elon / []
Pretty amazing job. / []
Agree 👍  thanks Elon / []
Say bye bye to the gravy train you sad govt employees. Ps learn to weld not code / []
Wow! A real Mine! / []
Thank you so much for opening up the real faces of the staff of Doge! They're mature, reasonable men who Instill confidence by the way they communicate what they do. These are straight forward men serious about the jobs they're doing. A much stronger picture of who is working for us! / []
its not for nothing Elon its for freedom. Theres a reason Russian and Ukrainians could not travel freely in to US or even Europe. There is a reason Putin with a 1/10 of military holds back the greatest western powers its not for nothing. See thats what Elon doesn't under stand because he has no skin in the game. He is new to all this. Its freedom Elon Ukrainians want it and Putin is like a horrible ex partner from a bad divorce showing up decades later trying to control again. Free people help free people. And if you need ideas on how to stop the war. I got a few. How about close all the internet accounts and social media accounts of all Oligarchs and their Wives, Girlfriends and Mistresses. The one thing that Rich people need is recognition and you take them off the global social media accounts from the top down you will see in weeks the war come to an end. All Social Media first, yes Elon even there bots and than start closing there bank accounts and tell them to come pick up the check for the closure account and than if they don't show up just like Treasury or a regular bank give them time and if they don't use the money to recoup the loses from the wars they are affiliated too. / []
Still in debt / []
Now Chuck Shchumer is having a heart attack? / []
My only question is, who printed the checks who received the checks and who cashed the checks? And why are they not being prosecuted yet? Is there an investigation going to investigate who received the money / ['There should be prosecution and jail time']

It is a tell! Criminals are always the loudest. / []
Thank you SO much for this. All you ever hear from Democrats is about Elon and hig gang of children.......what I saw was a group of Business executives working with Elon. Yes, there ARE young people on the team, but look at all these ADULTS you saw here. Thoughts and PRAYERS for Elon, President Trump, DOGE, and the President's Cabinet. Keep doing the hard work, us NORMAL people appreciate you. / []
I support everything you all are doing. I love the innovation and willingness to take on this monumental task. / []
This is not behind the scenes  Elon is protected from disclosing anything they are doing. / []

Elon I believe that if you or others would  buy a half hour media buy on every major network across  the country and Americans across  the country would see this interview of what Doge is really doing shining a light on the Doge teams incredible work. The whole  country  will be with you.  Small investment  with great opportunity. / []
You would have to be a saverely derranged person to disagree with what DOGE is trying to achieve for the United States. / []
It should be mandatory for Brainwashed indoctrinated Democrats to watch this story!!! / []
Thanks so much Elon and  wonderful  DOGE  team, God bless you! 🙏🕊🙏🕊🙏🕊🙏 / ["As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings.

all of these boys are total idiots / []
This was so informative! / []
Thank you all gentlemen!!!! / []
Can literally hear the left crying 36:57 / []
I'm not sure that Elon doesn't understand when they said the Social Security online system was down, they were insinuating it was because of him. / []
Is it me or does Brett Baier ask the same dumass questions over n over basically pushing the Democrat agenda....."will my 94 yr old mother still get her check"!!????  OMG for krissakes let's move the tell forward!!! Yiiish .... It's like he's not even listening to the 8 ppl talking at all / []
Elon Musk is a good man! / []
❤ / []
This is absolutely shocking! At the same time it’s not… / []
I never been so proud to be an American… USA USA USA / []
Great interview and very forth coming, and assuring that thing’s are being done right for the American people / []
On the whole, the group looks all right, but only if the so-called DOGE leader is relieved of his ultra-patriotic role and his cost-cutting trickery, by the government, and one of the others in the group takes charge. / []
💩ur tongue katte na hoy💩eat💩💩💩💩💩 / []
Again Common Sense!!!!!!!  Thank you, Elon!! / []
Elon is a terrific man.  I hate his Teslas but I still think he's a hero. / []
Brave of elon people to come on live TV do this since they been doxxed I think they are at the FAFO part they dont care, they know they are doing good so they aint afraid anymore good and its transperacy it wil lget out all over the net by this evening and watched everywhere anyway. / []
I am outraged that DOGE wasn't implemented 50 years ago BEFORE we were $36 TRILLION dollars in debt. This government cannot claim to act in the American People's best interest when they have failed to act in even the most minimal fiduciary manner. / []
Heros! / []
You guys are hero’s. Thank you for serving this country 👏 / []
❤ Wonderful people! Wish to have that in Brazil. / []
We are still operating with paper in the Federal Government, why didn’t Congress care about what’s going on, what is Congress for??? They do Nothing but put out fires!! Most of the time half do not show up to do anything but keep us fighting each other😡 / []
Next step is to lock up the fraudsters and shame them all over the news. / []
Who knew it would take a room full of autistic men to save the country from bankruptcy / []
what a great interview / []
That was so good / []
THIS IS WHAT I VOTED FOR! / []
When are we going to get rid of Chuck Schumer in my estimation always acts in criminal accusations towards Trump in Elon Musk and escalated damage on Tesla cars this is wrong so wrong this man should be fired immediately / []
Thank you all for your efforts on behalf of our Nation. 🇺🇸 / []
GOD Keep all the men in that room safe & healthy♥️🇺🇸 / []
If we can see the government spend our money in real time that will change the face of America forever. America First🇺🇸🫡 / []
In my daily prayers and rosary, I bring to my intentions that God keep protecting President Trump,  Elon Musk, and his team, and Their Families. God bless you. / []
WAKE UP MUSKTARDS!!! Yall  don’t even realize that DOGE is actually a meme coin that elon endorsed and those of us who own this crypto currency are laughing at all of you!!!! I can’t wait until elon’s next space adventure called to the moon 🚀🚀🚀.  Protect your President and don’t let this immigrant make a fool of him or this country / []
Thank you for doing this interview. Both the team and interviewer. So informative. / []
Love seeing beautiful minds / []
Wonderful interview.  This makes so much sense and I just pray people pay attention and support DODE's effort to keep America from going bankrupt. / []
Thank you for all you’ve doing to safe the USA. / []
the goverment is creating the most environmental waste each yr in programs and computor systems ,then? that alone will save the planet. / []
Thanks / []
Elon is the real Ironman / []
Thank You✨❤️🤍💙 / []
It’s all lies / []
We need "PERESTROYKA".. Somebody remembers this word? From Michail Gorbachev. / []
We needed a businessman in charge, to over see the spending / []
Why is everyone on the DOGE team white dudes? / []
Why is this, non elected, autistic South African gaming person involved in handeling US finances?  Answer; because he also is with the Russians. Putin, with the help of his long time pal Trump,  is slowly taking over and you blind critters don't even notice! In this pace the USA soon will be no moore. Pathetic... / []
Mark Kelly sucks. Even the “Right Stuff” have exceptions. And that’s Mark Kelly. / []
God bless you all! / []
This is what modern day hero's look like, they need capes. / []
I get it!  The living cheated government wanted this antiquated  system, know one before DOGE, came around could've positively kept good honest records and that's what had no transparency period! NOT ANYMORE! POSITIVALY / []
Why all these people speaking the loudest is the  guilty one that has the most to lose. Less stop paying all these retirement from retired congressman that are no longer in office. / []
Thanks Elon Musk and for all the men at DODGE for your  service to our country MAGA!!! / []
The acts of terrorism on Elon musk is because he's an idiot and people are sick of being ripped off his cars are falling apart they are put together with glue what kind of crap is this. Elon is going to reap what he has done. He needs to go back to Africa he is a alien. / []
awesome minds!!!!! / []
I hope everyone sees this, and the hate diminishes. 🇦🇺 / []
Brilliant face gentlemen! / []
Brilliant! / []

Watch the whole interview and happy there are men out there thinking about the future of our children, my question is why is the Democrat’s going so crazy about cutting waste in government, my computer skills seems to be better than our government? This is crazy the waste is so hard to understand, it’s making the American’s heads spin,  Thank-You everyone of these true Americans who is there to get our government computers system on track 💞 my prayers are for each of them, I will never vote Democrat again, their craziness is showing as we watch them talk and campaign against  them, if they weren’t corrupt, they would be standing with them and agreeing that there is waste, it’s clear now what the Democrat party really is……. / []
Dems are the worst liars & hypocrites in the world. They have no ethics, the end justifies the means with them. They and their policies are immoral, even evil. / []
I’m is the best team for this huge job …plain and simple 👍👍 / []
This was the most real interview I've ever seen. And it was on Fox. Brett has changed the perception I have of Fox News for me. / []
Elon Musk and the DOGE team is American Hero 🇺🇸💪！We the people love you All ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ / []
Anybody against what DOGE is doing after they watch this video has been hit in the head with a ball-peen hammer multiple times and will never understand! All the hours we work as a country to pay for things means this is finally a enormous miracle! This is a well done interview format to see what's going on! Thanks DOGE! / []
My heroes!!! / []

Gotta love Elon. / []

Wonderful explanation.  Thank you / []
Thank you Elon for everything you're doing and sacrificing for our nation / []
What an Amazing group of guys, so intelligent! Praise God for Trump & Doge MAGA / []
I hope one day Americans will realized that he is not saving us money he is replacing human work force. / []
I LOVE THESE GUYS / []
why Elon has to reply every answers .. he seems very controlling !! / []
Wow - astonishing!!  Keep up the good work DOGE!  I hope Congress can act on their end as well. / []
👏👏👏👏👏👏 / []
These are heroes that are giving their time and are not being paid. History will look back at them and see what a great thing they did to save this country. Don't believe the propaganda crap they're from the fraudsters. The fraudsters are the loudest ones complaining! Again, these men will be looked back in history as great men that did a great thing for this country! / []
Wow / []
Go team! / []
Thank you Elon for all you do / []
Unbelievably, the democRATS are fighting this! / []
Thank you so much, President Trump, Elon, and DOGE team. Don’t allow the Deep State to get to you and take you down. They are trying everyday.🙄 / []
watch and learn...thank you . / []
Thank you Elon and team.  Great work! / []
Complete cover up / []
Give him some credit just a bit / []
Elon is a great man and patriot. We are lucky to have him and President Trump. / []
I am glad they shared this info. / []
Good interview. / []
I never thought I would live to see this day. Thank you Trump, thank you Elon and thank you God. / ['Amen']
They're threatening Elon's over this? / []
yes for sure the ones that complain the most are the fraudsters . Any business owner can tell you that . / []
The people profiting from the frauds are the ones complaining about DOGE. Period. Go DOGE GO! / []
We should to seaport elon musk, we have to respect elon musk. / []
27:45 - Hasn't the "over 120" statistic been rebuffed as a data merging error? / []
Ukraine vs Russia is not a winnable war for Ukraine,  period. They haven't got the funds, the munitions,  or the soldiers to defeat Russia. And it should go without saying, Russia has thousands of n-kes. President Trump is the only world leader who's come up with a viable peaceful solution. Ukraine must concede it won't get back the territory it's lost. The minerals deal would put US mining companies and US personnel in Ukraine.  Russia will stop attacking Ukraine because to continue to do so would be an attack on Americans. Imagine how that would play out. Putin isn't a stupid or reckless man. And neither is Trump. UK PM Starmer spoke so eloquently about putting boots on the ground and planes in the air. But only with US backing. The citizens of the UK wont fight in Ukraine.  It was a very eloquent and worthless speech. / []
These men are absolute heroes in my mind. Giving of themselves, their talent, their skills, their knowledge to improve the United States government as a face, the hatred from the left. If I could, I would salute you all. / ["I'm with, YOU 😊❤❤❤", 'Where is big balls.', "@Andy28-m6e I'm sitting here, reading these comments.", 'People will soon look back on these radicals of today exactly how we look back on the people who spat in the Vietnam Vets when they came home.', "Thank you ma'am"]
Wow brilliant, Thanks Doge / []
Holy nerd fest / ['Yup LOL']
Elon and his team are actually the kind of public servants that used to work for the government a century ago. / []
In my book, Elon is a patriot and thank God we have him on the right side of history. / []
show us the money. / []
I’m seeing Gen X finally stepping up. I believe we were meant to be the generation that made a change. / []
Thank you guys 🙏.  Future generations should remember you guys like a war hero. I really appreciate what you did in DOGE. / []

Need to ask if they have found where any politicians have received kickbacks/ money from the government. / []
Right on elln / []
What an amazing team of intelligence / []
YOU ALL NEED TO MEET EVERY MONTH OR TWO JUST TO LET AMERICANS KNOW WHATS REALY HAPPENING !!!! GREAT SHOW BRETT / []
All of this is amazing,great, and 100% has my full support. All that said what is going to stop the current administration or the next ones from just going right back to doing this.. I mean, there needs to be a constitutional amendment that makes it impossible to allow this all to happen again, or all of this is for nothing.. / []
Fokin legend Elon! / []
DAAANGG..how could this possibly ever work without some Old,"0utDATED".. Government CRONY'$? soooo... Some young guys are going to fix all this that easily? you bet... lolololololol♾️🫶💯🇺🇸 / []
Where is BIG BALLS! ❤ / []
That is, not to make the work of US government agencies more efficient, but to reduce costs? Measure seven times, cut once! Seven, not two! Call the former Minister of Economic Development of Russia Alexey Ulyukayev, he will make government services for you with interdepartmental interaction quickly and painlessly for US residents. And much cheaper. / []
Thanks Elon and DOGE! Keep doing great work and save genuine tax payers! Godspeed! / []
FAKE MANAGEMENT TEAM / ALL hired to make it look like Elon is doing the right thing! ALL TO DISTRACT FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION PUTTING AMERICANS and OUR MILITARY AT RISK!!!! F’K UPS!!! / []

When I sold cars people would come in and try to use their babies social get car loans. This was a common issue that’s why they name the kids the same as dad or mom. / []
This is DOGE , i was expecting young people 20s, these guys are my dads age. / []
Thank you for this program Bret. This is  wonderful information as are the men who sacrificed  their time to saved our country. Thanks to them & their  families  for the contribution. / []

This team is a group of well qualified business people with real world experience. They are effectively conducting audits on each department. How can we not appreciate them? / []
DOGE and what they are doing really isn’t rocket science. 🙄 / []

Interesting that the Democrats have said the Doge team were young people, teens.   lol.  They aren’t that young. / []
Elon is a hero in my book.  He doesn’t have to put himself out there like this.  Please God keep him safe and Trump and all of his team from anyone trying to do harm to them. / []

Keep on DOGE-ing baby. / []
They need.  To reorganize trucking and get rid of the freight brokers, freight brokers that are ripping everyone off and stealing money from truckers and stealing money from carriers. And stealing money from truck drivers / []
President Trump literally dodged a bullet, and America dodged a bullet when Kamala wasn't elected! Go Elon! Go Doge Team!! True Patriots! / []

US ofA should be working on a zero based budget.... Simple budgeting advice. / []
I LOVE ELON !!! / []
It would help if dems and mainstream media would help instead of what they have been doing / []
One day Americans will look at these people as Heros who saved the country from bankruptcy !!! Why would you not these successful brilliant businessmen help the government become efficient? Why ? / ['The wealthy paid their fair share of taxes and people like Donald Trump, who did not pay taxes for seven years would pay their taxes we wouldn’t be in this situation', 'Only this big talk no work product Congress is holding the country back.

Stop all your lieing all of you are going to go to hell. GOD is going to show you better than tell you. All this about the rich getting richer. If it wasn't the rich would pay their fair share in taxes if you can calculate the taxes of the working class the government should be able to do the same for the rich and not by giving them tax breaks.

Perfect questions, excellent pertinent short answers. Well rehearsed. Great whitewash. Same bs Trump pulled. / []
Thank GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for Trump!!!!!! And elon!! / []
What a time to be living in. Bless these patriots! / []
Senator Kelly wants the war to keep on going. Trump and the Patriots want the war to stop. Apparently Senator Kelly is getting money funneled back to him somehow. He has a vested interest in this war. All the Democrats do. And even some of the Republicans, I’m sure. / []
Amazing interview! Keep up the good work! / []
Best interview I've ever seen.  This is so encouraging.  Thanks Fox News for this. / []
Musk and team needs to also do these interviews on unfriendly corporate media to educate all the idiots shaping a false narrative on DOGE. So far, Elon has been sticking with mostly Fox and a friendly guy like Rogan. Sadly, most of the country is in the dark or being told lies. The idea that they are so misled that it would enrage people enough to bomb Tesla property should tell you something. / []
The IQ in that room is staggering! Of course uneducated liberals have to tell lies about these men, because they can’t understand that level of intellect!! 😡 / []
This is fascinating / []
Are they all on speed? Hahaha / []
Love Elon Musk team. Smart and intelligent rescue the USA. NAM MO A DI ĐÀ PHẬT / []
My fellow Americans, yr president took a bullet for u people, for those who r still against him , its so disgusting n disgraceful, when will u ever grow up n be decent human being.. / []
ELON is a patriot and a hero. The whole doge team is amazing! Thank you for all you do!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Elon musk is the best. Thank you, thank you, for all you are doing for us. / []
Genius at work. DOGE patriots 🎉🎉 Godspeed 🙏 / []
This is amazing. / []
I guarantee;  guarantee that the scam is leaving everyone marked alive in Social Security so the scammers can work the other agencies.  The scammer knows it; guaranteed. / []
Love Elon. Thank you sir, and the entire DOGE team. Good interview / []
EXCELLENT!!! GREAT! LOVE IT!!!!!!! / []
Fake people, ….jamming up the line / []
A person must live in TDS to not appreciate the work that the DOGE teams is doing. / []
God bless you DOGE / []
Thank you! / []
No money to Ukraine!! Not without trade! / []
The irony is if you’re late making payments to IRS you bet there will be accountability 😮 / []
Elon is absolutely right about sen. Mark Kelly / []
Don't stop, keep going until all the waste is gone. / []
Illegal migrants who came recently boosting their credit history and getting hundred thousands of loans and leaving usa. / []
Thank you, Trump, Elon & the entire DOGE team and all others helping cut all of the Frad and waste! All of us sane AMERICANS appreciate you!!!! / []
We have finally got a strong enough President Trump that has picked a great team that are strong enough to save our country. / []
And when do you and your DOGE team plan on providing all this information to Congress and testifying before them? / ["It's online. Also they are providing info to congress on a constant basis. Didn't you listen to the interview?", "@hutfam\xa0 I'm asking about why they still haven't appeared before Congress or even been confirmed by Congress?! Doge should first be confirmed as a legit department by Congress, Elon should also be confirmed by Congress as a legit administrator, and then, he (Elon) should appear before Congress to present these findings."]
NGL I dony understand what Elon Musk is saying 😅 / []
Americans are very grateful for all the Doge team is doing...Elon Musk is a hero.. / []
J'habite en Belgique et ça renforce mon opinion que Elon Musk& Dodge ce sont des patriotes qui aime leur nation et qui ont beaucoup de respect pour leur président Donald Trump il faut diffuser ça partout dans le monde il faut vraiment que  qu'on sache que tous ces démocrates c'est anciens Président depuis Bush père jusqu'à Biden c'était tous des escrocs et des voleurs qui n'ont pensait qu'à eux ainsi que. leurs administration des criminels ont devrait leurs retirer leur titre de présidents ne plus recevoir des indemnités et être traduit en justice tous à Guantanamo ainsi que les juges corrompus bravo à Monsieur Elon Musk et a toute l'équipe Doge Bénédiction ✝️🩸🙏🔥❤️❤️❤️💯🇺🇲👏👏👏👏🇧🇪 / []
To be faced with such evil every day must be a heavy task. This team rocks. / []
What a relief to have these business elites saving America! Proud of them. Thank you Fox for the interview. / ["*gullible people don't use their brain.

Without it he would have give bankrupt. THAT is where our money is going.  He’s looking everywhere else, except there. Kinda strange don’t you think?']
Thank God we have Elon helping us and all the DOGE people. My goodness, these Dems need to just stop their BS. / []
Very passionate, great to see some good morals being used / []
I'm guessing the "trillion" they save from Government scams and waste will be used to pay "America's debt". But once that is accomplished🙄, will all that new annually saved money go to "America's people's pockets" / []
Shut your damaged rich mouth, please, Elon.  They dying for their country, and you are piece of Putins puppy. / []
Thank you Elon and the rest of the team ❤️🙏 / []
Thank you to Elon and the team he has put together. Many many people support this, the haters are just the loudest people in the room / []
if something doesn't make sense it's usually a lie so then you look at the person that's is accepting the money😮 / []
That's why the politicians don't want it fixed / []
Elon..100 percent telling truth. He has everything to lose,  and nothing to gain. / ['He has Billions of dollars in government contracts!   - Elon does']

Well done, Gents. / []
Those incredibly old Social Security recipients are no doubt stolen Social Security numbers. Probably by illegal immigrants. When you illegally buy a Social Security number to change your identity legal status, they routinely use dead peoples Social Security numbers. This is why the left doesn’t want this discovered / []
Thank you, to each of you, for all you are doing!! / []
If he's a senator, he should GET BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT. / []
Unreal how great a man Elon is! / []
THE DEMS DON'T WANT AMERICA TO BE SUCCESSFUL,THEY ARE COMMUNIST, PLAIN AND SIMPLE / []
DOGE is doing even better than I had hoped.  I'm grateful that these men are providing our country with this incredible upgrade to the technology and streamlining of the duplication of departments and processes!   It's amazing what they're doing for the citizens of our country!  👍🇺🇲🌞 / []
Great info. Wow. They are doing a great job for the benefit us and our Country. / []
Every screaming and crying democrat needs to watch this. / ["Won't make a difference. They are too far gone to be reasoned with."]

When i was in the army we took all the office desks chairs and computers and threw them in the dumster ,and rebuy the same stuff just too use up the money before oct. So we the army could ask for more money next year , and so they didn't get a budget cut . I was like i buy that they said no who we give the money too. What a waste. This during a time when we had a hard time staying on flight statdis because of lack of fuel for our helecopters. Abd i couldn't increase my rank because pay for 1 school a yr and that was your summer camp. / []
We should support our elected President Trump and Mr Elon Musk full support, clean up all of the mess from previous administrations and make America a better place to live, work, and wealth. / []
Yeah know if you cut spending and then tax billionaires on par with regular people, the deficit would be wiped out. So why not tax more the billionaires / ['The billionaires pay 70% of the taxes 😂😂😂']
Thank you DOGE! Amazing to see so many wealthy, businessmen for DOGE. Keep it up gentlemen! We the US citizens are behind you! 🥰❤️🇺🇸💪💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Very interesting thread ❤ / []
Cut the Military budget, and Aid to other countries including Israel. / []
Our government has failed the taxpayers miserably. Trump is the only president willing to fix our government!!! / []
Elon is my celebrity crush ❤ / []
Go DOGE! God bless Elon and AMERICA 🇺🇸 / []
What a diverse amazing team ! Thank you ! / []
Market research targets the easiest opportunities. Let’s see if they follow through before securing their contracts. Oh wait, they’ve already received substantial government contracts in the past few months.  Anyone can analyze Monday morning quarterbacking. So, Doge, why are you taking these massive contracts simultaneously claiming to be working towards saving money?  Let me guess, your long-term contracts?  I don’t know, but we should all look it up to verify that it’s publicly available information. / []
Is is true that 1 Trillion dollars is equal  to $1,000 billion dollars?  Please check. / []
DOGE will bring hard Americans earned tax money back on track in spending wastes and this means put more money into Americans taxpayers pockets back and for America economy 1st! 😁👏 / []
How about an EO that if a department doesn't pass an audit, the directors are imprisoned / []
Elon Musk is the Man! / []
Democrats watching this must be furious 🤣😅😂 / []
These men are genuine heroes. / []
Smart private sector, stupid government. That's what we elect / []
I mean anyone who thinks D.O.G.E. Is not necessary is literally crazy.!!! I don’t want my tax dollars going to garbage / []
LIES! ALL LIES!!! / []
This is insane, y'all, that we didn't know what was going on.  Those who stole from us are jerks. / []
Can't we Siu the Media and the DEMOS for their lying about what DOGE is doing? The about Social Security could give old people HEART ATTACKS! / []
Thank you so much for introducing the DOGE team / []
Last time Elon said it was 10000 a month to retire.  Der. / []
It feels good to be optimistic and proud of my government for a change. / []
DOGE hmu. I'd like a job!!!! Data mining, QC, UIE, etc... / []

35:00 that eye jerk to the left when he said that is concerning. / []
FoxNews should have a monthly update on government waste with DOGE. / []
They are alot of good people that have worked for the goodness of everyone. They have been left behind the very people that have made america what we were the heck with us and them. Aint right / []
Doge is amazing❤ / []
How can you not love him? / []
Thank you to the Team to every member, those kids especially. Thanks for helping selflessly with your country in mind. Can only say this many thousand times. You guys will go down in history like the founding fathers. / []

I thank God for Donald Trump, Elon Musk and the courageous people of DOGE! / []

Musk and DOGE are doing a great job. Keep it up. Thank you all for what you guys are doing. / []
Thank you for the DOGE team. These guys are doing for America 🇺🇸. People wake up to see what is going on behind the left lies and steal taxpayer money. / []
Great interview, Brett. I'm all on board with DOGE. My Social Security is just fine. My identity was just recently stolen in February 2025, and I was concerned that the thief would hack into my social security checks, so I'm glad that Social Security is doing away with phone calls to gain access to Social Security information. / []
Mark Kelly is a t _ _itor! / []
Thank You All!!!! God bless you and keep you!!! Always! / []
Wish Trump would have done this during his first term / []
This is so shocking / []
“You are a traitor” LMAO / []
More entertaining than any movie! Real change in real time. We are witnessing history. The dawn of the Golden Age. Thank you / []
Thank you for letting us meet the DOGE Team. They are all extremely well spoken, well educated, knowledgeable, committed, and working hard for the American people. ❤❤❤💕💕🙏🙏. Thank you gentlemen, for your hard work. / []
Very dedicated and committed team ❤❤! President Trump has great vision for America!❤❤❤ / []
Great interview. / []
A billion dollars for a survey 🤦🏾 / []
Has Bair had a brain injury?  Same question over and over again.  How many times does he need to be told no intention to harm the innocent. / []
I can't thank everyone in DOGE for all what they do to save the ship. I can't believe any American who loves this great country wouldn't appreciate the great sacrifice DOGE and Elon Musk offering to all of us. The Lord gave them amazing gifts of intelligence and they are using all their gifts generously for America. May the Lord bless and protect everyone in the team  I feel terrible when I hear the low llangugae and rumors some of the democrats are using for political reasons. They don't care about their own country. The disaster that many people are believing their lies without using their brains. / []
Wow I have so much respect for this group of guys 🇺🇸✨️🇺🇸. Protect them by all means. / []
How in the heck were all these things happening 😤😡🤯🤯 / []
Thank you Elon and your crew what a great job. America are depending on your crew.❤❤❤ / []
Great job Elon…!👏 / []
Terrific interview. Again, these men are absolutely trying to improve our outdated and massively inflated systems for the benefit of all of us. I don’t understand how anyone could be against this. / []
What musk is talking is all in the bible..God will help him expose all.. / []
It’s time for real change in this corrupt world not just in America over here in the UK too. / []
Social security systems are at 98.5 efficient. Better than tesla. / []
For evil to triumph, good men have to do nothing. Thanks guys for doing so much. / []
Everyone was like “deport Elon” a couple days ago now y’all kissing his feet it’s disgusting. / []
That team really has the balls to get the job done!❤ / []
Bravo DOGE Team!!! / []
Bs, they're cutting my social security / []
Preach, Elon. / []
Is this guy trying to mimic Elon, he seems to emulate his talking mannerisms ? / []
This is mind blowing!! / []
Pay cuts should  be on the  table / []
Where would we be without Trump, his Cabinet, Elon Musk and Doge. I’m so thankful that Trump won this election!!! / []
15 million over the age of 120.....Are these Nursing homes? That don't report someone died ? / []
Other countries should hire these people to root out corruption, as long as you have a supportive President and cabinet!!! / []
Thank god for Elon, his group, and president Trump! Time to clean up this mess. Thank you / []
Elon, I think you found " it". The thing Dems fear you discovering.  Lack of communication between systems. / []
This was sooo powerful!!! It shows how Elon & the DOGE team TRULY CARES!! At least that is how it came across!! More of this on a micro level ie. HHS - What was found high level update DOD FBI HSI etc. / []
DOGE for the WIN. / []
Yep they're not efficient in spending our money . But they're really efficient in taking our  money.????? / []
finally someone gets it the old computer systems... / []
THANK YOU DOGE!!!!!! We appreciate the sacrifices you all are making. / ['Q']
10 years from now there will be a memorial or statue celebrating DOGE located somewhere in our nation's capital. / []
Elon just said it best….those that bellyache the most ARE the fraudsters! / []

This guy's entire business model is making money off the government... Please let him run his companies without government assistance / []
Great job. Thank you Elon Musk and all❤ / []
Bring me your receipts / ['I only have recipes.']

After listening to this I now know why so very many young people refuse to or need to work. Are they the fraudsters?😢 / []
If we just taxed the top 1% with the same tax brackets as we use on the lower 90%, our debt would be gone in 4 years. / []
May God bless this wonderful human being! Elon is the true meaning of the word Patriot!! / []
You can see Elon is emotional about this good for him much love / []
Thank you God for these amazing people to allow us all to see and understand the enormous issues facing our nation that have been hidden to us for so many years. / []
It's about time, government agencies be overseen,  audited and cleaned up. / ['Musk revived 38 billion dollars in bail out from the government for Tesla and Space x.

Elon is a world hero! / []
Sorry MUSKY haven’t seen your president do anything mean? So calling Canada NASTY? Our PM his governor? Attacking Canada their longest ally? So none of this was MEAN? Put the pipe down and clear your drug addled mind! / []
I can’t wait till doge goes to the pentagon and the department of defense. Hopefully they will find the UFO’s / []
Finally the truth is emerging. / []
This is utterly ridiculous. I’m curious to know who approves doges’ contacts and payments. Or is this merely a money transfer mechanism for these individuals to claim expertise and qualifications without any relevant experience or qualifications?  If you, the individuals making these claims, could please provide explanations and justifications for your assertions and facts, and refrain from attacking small businesses, which contribute to the greatness of our country, we would be able to focus on the substantial financial entities, such as corporations and agencies that lack competition in bidding. / []
Outstanding!  Thank you ❤🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 / []
Thank you Elon and Elon should be our next president / []
Social Security is not a Ponzi Scheme. It is an intergenerational, pay-as-you-go, system. Created in 1935, it has not missed a single payment to beneficiaries in 90 years. / []
I love these guys. The idiots who don’t are ignorant or evil or both. / []
Thank you, Thank you Doge team!! Ya'll are incredible and America needs you so much. GOD BLESS YOU ALL❤ / []
get ready for the looney left backlash, they are blind by choice through hatred for Trump, thats the only reason they will not support anything positive from this administration, shame on you Democrats! Go Trump Go Doge, i feel very proud of these achievements and im not even American 😅 / []
They should’ve gotten these guys out 2 months ago. Even I fell for mainstream media pretending the DOGE team was a bunch of teenagers. / []
This country owes Elon Musk an enormous favor. / []
yall believe anything 😂 / []
Where are all the haters at??? 😂 / []
Democrats are out of their commons sense if they against these actions. They are heroes that try to save our country... / []
Godspeed Doge / []
You will notice these are all entrepreneurial or engineering types of men. No DEI or HR females. DOGE represents a massive transformation of our technology and economy led by brilliant men. It is more than is; however, it could be termed the "AI Revolution." Our economy is moving from a Globalist monetary system to a modern industrial powerhouse. It will use lots of AI/robotics and will set amazing standards and goals--such as reaching Mars. But the old bureaucratic Washington D.C. stranglehold on innovation is being dismantled by heroic men. The AOCs and the Squads cannot stop it despite all their hysteria. / []
Very informative,..Auditing,Auditng,Auditing,thats the secret.Peace to America🙏 / []
Absolutely fascinating!!! So glad this interview is grreat!! Thank you so much. Very informative.  God bless you all. ❤ / []

Don't know what all the fuss is. It is astonishing that this review is happening to make the government accountable to the people; it is astonishing that it has not been done before and that the government was just trusted with no checks and balances. / []

By Musk definition of a trader. He classifies as on for South Africa aka His country. / []
They can’t go by line by line the Democrats. It’s not possible. The brain cannot handle such a thing. The brain of the left cannot handle it. I can’t go by a line by line you’re talking about detailed information not possibly mentally for them. The left only goes by feelings and emotionnot facts. / []
Thank you very informative / []
Elon should be loved by the american people ! IMP as an english man watching from a far what a legend. / []

Thank God for the Administration, the Cabinet and DOGE. May this truly be the beginning of Golden era of America, for all Americans. / []
How could any intelligent American be against this? / []
They have attacked plenty of specifics. That's a balled face lie.  9 billion cut turned out to be only 9 million.  The "cave" or "mine" they refer to is already digitized.  Just more BS.  The cave is a paper backup, and the people working there have already refuted all these statements.  Keep the lies coming for Fake Fox News to keep the BS going.  Trump is the biggest lying president of all time. Nixon is in his grave glad he's been bumped off the top. / []
A lot of people in the comments could use with listen to the opposition and how dangerous Elon’s actions can be / []
Sad the democrats are just vile these days. These men are hero's / []

Great insight.. although we all would like to hear from Elon, I was hoping tp hear from others on the panel and get a better idea of their character. / []
Trying to stop Tesla from tanking at this point. And I'm a Musk supporter since PayPal days. Since his involvement with Trump it's becoming harder to keep the support up. / []
As a long time Republican, I will NEVER vote Republican again after the disappointment I'm seeing in the this embarrassment of a group called DOGE and the current administration. They sold us OUT! / []
Thank you Elon Musk. / []
This discussion and meet n greet needed to happen. The logic is undeniable! Unfortunately, there is no lie Dems won’t tell and no low that Dems won’t go, and their minions will not listen or change their minds. Dems villainize Elon for trying to save an imminent financial demise at the hands of the Democrat party and their puppet masters. / []

Am I the Only one that was Waiting the See the Famius “BIG BALLS” ..??? / []
Our country is in grave danger of going bankrupt so let's give the wealthiest Americans a $4.7 Trillion dollar tax cut over the next 10 years.   Makes sense to the wealthy and the politicians they fund.   In the last 50 years there has been a $70 Trillion dollar transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1% wealthiest Americans who now control 90% of American wealth.   These non elected billionaires are NOT looking out for the average American even though they want you to believe that.  They do put on a good show.  Very talented men indeed. / []
Leftists are cowards. They never actually do tough interviews like this. / []
Thank you Elon &  all these patriotic men helping our government run smoothly / []

If even a small fraction of these claims are true, people need to be arrested immediately. / []
When I worked for the government I was required to have and use a government credit card when I was on travel for the government work.  As an example if I had to get a hotel room while on travel or air tickets  was charged "government rates". I asked what the government rate was compared to normal rates.  Government rates were generally twice as much as normal rates. / []
These guys save our country from bankruptcy. We must support them. / []

You guys are heroes. Thank you for everything you do!! / []
Why cut Social Security! Why don't you go after the military industrial complex 3 billion for a jet there you can go cut that s*** right there / []

Elon’s comment about media propaganda is the real cause of the attacks against Tesla is 100% spot on.  If you are a democrat or liberal progressive I’m sure this is hard for you to hear.  Most of you are much younger than me.  I have worked for DoD for over 30 years.  I’m a Cold War baby and also a witness to the Global War on Terror.  I’ve tried to objectively look at the world and even voted for Obama the first time.  I had high hopes for him but ultimately his policies and those of his democrat party prove to me they only wanted power and their state goal of fundamentally transforming America wasn’t for the better.  In fact I believe they intentionally attempted to weaken the United States.  They are still attempting this with a disregard for truth.  I’ve learned with time and perspective that we as a people are being deceived, not in an obvious way but in a long term systemic way to slowly degrade and weaken our society.  We are a bastion of individual liberty and freedom but there are many who naively believe in collective socialism with a hope of some future benevolent oligarchs.  Ultimately humans always work to their own self interest.  That is why it is so important to have a limited government based on capitalist principles.  Morals are also important which is why it is so dangerous to strip away value based religions.  My point is the liberal left and Democratic Party has lost its way and it’s highly probable their propaganda mainstream media is intentionally trying to weaken the United States  with socialist ideology masquerading as benevolent liberalism.  Today’s Democratic Party is a corrupt and destructive ideology which should be voted out of power. / []
I can see those founding fathers are smiling rn / []
When you do it, you are a criminal behind bars. When government does it, it's normal. / []
This team is an example of American exceptionalism. These guys are at the pinnacles of their careers and they are taking time for the patriotic service to their country. The best of the best. They are incredibly inspiring and make make me feel proud of my country again. I would like to learn more about the lower level team members and hear their stories. Thank you guys and especially Elon for staying with it despite the harm being caused him. / []
Why do they audit everybody else but the gov? / []
I 100% believe the little computers TSA and Customs use are not linked to anything or else how could someone use a fake passport. / []
Talked my sister-in-law out of buying a Honda this morning. Encouraged her to go test drive a Model 3. An hour later she's ordering the car on her phone and we're going to pick it up Saturday. She's also a first responder. All Americans owe this team a debt of gratitude. / []

Miss information and slunder of leftist woke democrats should counter by Trump Administration. / []
Elon Musk has a huge heart!  That’s what I’m walking away with.  I never doubted the integrity of DOGE or their motives/goals.  Listening to and seeing in Elons face his compassion for America and her people made me proud.  He’s a good man, a giving man and now I see just how big his heart is 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 / ['His team seems as committed to making it better …great again.', 'Wasnt Tesla just sued in 2023 by the EEOC for ongoing and widespread racism of black people? Not to mention all the union busting? In your perfect America do you think people trying to get paid more and treated better at work should be fired for doing so? This is exactly Elon’s philosophy. This isn’t a critism of your political beliefs it’s a critism of your idolization of musk please focus on policy not person.']
I can't wait to see what the dams have to say to this report. They're going to find a way to spend this and say they're stealing that they're lying and that none of the money they're saving is going to go back to anybody. Can't wait to see what CNN and MSNBC report on these findings / []
The Democrats have been stealing tax money and taking in countless illegal immigrants to use them to grow their power. With the rise of President Trump, their conspiracy and their erosion of the country will likely come to an end. However, they must be held accountable and pay the price. / []
This is a dream team. / []
These guys are 1000% right.  Regardless of your party. / []
We really appreciate this…thanks to all! / []
love this truth.....many thanks / []
This is What the definition of what God Speed Means, we can only hope for Success as a People some at Least that need the Gov.benifits. thank you guys for being the good guys. / []

This is so bad.  We all struggle daily to make ends meet , why do they waste money . Thank you  for doing this  Elon Musk 👏 / []
🌙 Doge to the moon 🌙   🚀 with Elons rocket 🚀 / []
Guess what. No one will be arrested. Your government was stealing a lot of money. / []
Elon’s goal of taking spending down from $49,500 per household per year to $38,000……is too much nibbling around the edges.     Gov’t needs to either be body slammed or pile driven….  So that would be $7000 per household per year, AND NOBODY PAYS INCOME TAX EVER AGAIN / []
Excellent 👍Elon MUSK , your goal is going after those people who used propaganda and paid those people to do threat and violence in your stores. / []
A man of out time / []
Winning hearts and minds / []

PHENOMENAL & I'm just a Brit, who adores America, Trump, Elon & this whole DOGE crew. Incredibly intelligent people & THAT'S what's freaking out the activists in mainstream media.

Trump's cabinet is the ultimate clean up crew. 🙏🏽 / []
But instead we have Selensky making statements like Putin is going to be dead soon it’s a fact or something like that. How is that going to make a peace deal happen and end the war? Just trying to trigger him and keep the war going. / []

It is very sad to see attacks against Elon Musk who created the best EV car ahead of US MANUFACTURES, SPACEX, using a rocket to retrieve two stranded astronauts and helps many companies pushing their products in space and now saving the country from BANKRUPTCY. ALSO IF THE COUNTRY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY , “EVERYBODY”L O O E S  S “. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEING”! / []
I feel like we have a two wing system so that when the democrats are done playing around, the Republicans can go in and clean up so that the democrats can go back in and play. And this just happens every 4, 8 or so on years. Back and forth. / []
There will be A LOT of wailing & gnashing of teeth on the democrat side over this video. / []

WE R ALL BEHIND U GUYS AND U WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS PATRIOTS FOR THE WORK UR DOING! VERY PROUD OF U GUYS! / []
These guys will be on a document some day and looked upon like the signing of the declaration of independence / []
Musk and his team deserve a medal for their work to fix and update the government so we who have worked our whole life get our benefits we paid for instead of those who have defrauded the United States of America and have stolen our money.

I wager it’s not random radicalized people firebombing Tesla. It’s too intense to be normal people. It must be the criminals and fraudsters that have been systematically scamming various government systems to the tune of trillions of dollars. They’re getting their scams chopped off at the knees by DOGE. Those people are the ones capable of firebombing. Are they hoping to intimidate DOGE into stopping their work? And the left leaning media strangely skews reports towards justifying the anger. It’s asinine. / []
I don’t know Bret but I know who I like and don’t like. And Bret seems to be on the other side, he just straddles the fence. / []
We are thankful for Elon. 🙏❤ / []

Wonderful all these men came together to save our free republic from bankruptcy.  Great interview, all the men pointing out all the computer errors at all the different branches of the government  system.

History will remember Elon and his amazing team as heroes in the best tradition of service to country. / []
I haven’t seen file banks with folders since the late 80’s.  That tells me these older people didn’t think or didn’t care about investing in and transferring anything onto computer systems.  They probably didn’t understand how to use them.  Sad. But even if they had, they would still be way behind thinking 1980’s tech would still be feasible now.  lol. / []

Elon has always been very honest & transparent. Making himself available to answer questions, explain what he's doing. These men are incredibly generous with their time & knowledge. They ARE DOGE. They see a problem and have the knowledge to addtess & are rectifying it. If you dislike him, or Donald Trump, put that aside. Consider the money they're saving  to make sure the future of America. The future of the country that your children, grandchildren are going to live in, grow up in, run a business in, grow old in. / []
I’ve been sitting back observing the POTUS at work, like I have every president who first comes into office. And if I can’t stand what they’re doing, then I figure there’s only about three years left. I don’t lose my ever loving mind. My head doesn’t spin all the way around, I don’t bully, threaten, or get destructive. That’s the difference between the two parties now and it’s surreal to see what’s happening. I wonder if I’m on candid camera sometimes. / []
Incredible!! Thank you Elon and team! / []
It's called terrorism!!!! / []
TRUMP AND DOGE HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT!!!  NOW FIRE ALL THESE RADICAL JUDGES PLEASE!!!!  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!! / []
There's a lot of news around issues with Elon Musk being in charge of this, but all the man ever did was better our society through the innovations he helped foster. I trust this man given his track record of his past successes. / []

Amercia is with you Ellon! We got your back! / []
I like what D.O.G.E is accomplishing,the democrats opposed to D.O.G.E. are likely the one's who create these wasteful programs that are fleecing tax payers. / []
Excellent Job / []
Democrats will still not support this and will call sll of these patriots...nazis amd liers and yes this is a threat to our democracy.. . This is so disgusting and there better be lots of people in prison soon. / []
Wow!  Thank you!  One and All!  for All your efforts! The United States owes you a Debt of Gratitude to you All! Thank you again!  You Rock! / []
Ok i respected Elon... But this man is truly real. I would love an exception and be able to have him as president / []
Which one is big balls? / []
Why are Democrats against them?  Either they are the ones who benefit most from this financial waste,  Or  They know that DOGE will be a resounding success and generate a lot of money for the government treasury, which will in turn make Trump more popular and rise in the polls. / []
Trump🇺🇸💪🏻Elon🇺🇸💪🏻America Strong💪🏻🇺🇸America 1st💪🏻🇺🇸 / []
That Social Security money is probably going to ACT BLUE / []
“For WHAT” is sooooo the right thought process. / []
More of this Brett!  Great report.  It’s very reassuring to see the quality and capabilities of these Doge Heads, and Elon being  serious.    The job needs to be  done, but a lot of us have been scared by the size and scope, the  rough approach and surprise entry of Musk. / []
I'm 1000% behind Trump and DOGE but, not having understood more of the "behind the scenes" caused me to have some misgivings until watching this interview. The interview was stellar because as an average American, it all began to click after listening to each one of these men talk specifically about each of their parts after learning about their backgrounds. These are intelligent businessmen who see the horribly inefficient ways our government is being run and needing to apply everyday business common sense while explaining it in such a way that really anyone can understand. / []
Everything he says makes sense except his position on telework. It makes no sense to keep building leases when covid showed us that telework works.    U have bldgs half full or less yet all agency goals were achieved. The logical take away would be to cut the bldg / []
OUTSTANDING ELON MUSK AND YOUR TEAM OF ALL YOUR PEOPLE!  THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICE & GOD BLESS YOU & YOUR FAMILES! YOU HAVE TOTAL SUPPORT FROM ALL OF US!🇺🇸🇵🇱🇺🇸🇵🇱🇺🇸🙏❤️😊👍♥️ / []
Tell you the truth Mr President Trump elon's making a fool out of you and just look oh taxpayers are paying all the bills / []
Trump should make it illegal to fit that much autism in one room 😂. But great work DOGE / []
Thank you Elon and the great team of patriots! / []
I work in Space & Defense,   Rockets ,Satellites,Missiles,ELON ROCKS! / []
Wonderful hearing exactly what you gentlemen are working toward.  Bravo👏👏   Ye of little faith, research for the truth.  Brainwashed lock step humans!!! / []
I am so impressed that these people would do this for our country.  It shows their regard for America.  Why are they only allowed 130 days?  Couldnt we just change this to a permanent department so that no one can do this to us again?  Will we now have a permanent DOGE department going forward?? / []
In china, Malaysia...we have billionaires to fund education n what not...but American billionaires rarely heard of this / []
Awesome explanation!  This will help many the lies spreading by Democrats and liberal media are clearly false. / []
Thank you,ELON and TEAM. ❤❤❤ Shameful,the waste,stealing,money laundering ocurring for decades with no accountability to taxpayers. / []
Go DOGE go! / []
This was a historical interview. / []
I see there wasn't any meaningful questions pulled from X to present on air. / []
HOW CAN ANYONE AFTER WATCHING THIS DISAGREE WITH D.O.G.E !!  IF YOU DO , THEN YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!!! / []
I imagine that other nations captured by evil will find much fraudulent activity lining pockets of thieves in positions of power! / []
One of the greatest Shows Bret...thank you❤❤❤❤ / []
hands up for the doge team get our money back / []
Remeber your stupid lmao 😂 Elon  understand they hate you  insert eyes rolling . / []
Maybe they wanted the war to continue because Democrats have always said we need to lessen the population on earth. / []
If they..THEY still complain after this.. theres no hope for them / []
Elon Musk DOGE THE mans with the laptops the BIG BALLS. 😡🤬 / []
American heroes!! / []
Democrats push  the lies because they don't want their money and their businesses taken away from them.All the stealing from the American people is going to stop there is panic mode.They're so corrupt / []
Where was the lady that they said was leading the DOGE efforts? Why wasn’t,t she in the interview? Another show of dishonesty by Doge. / []
Where did all that money go? / []
The sad part is people believe those lies because they lack simple logic. / []
Outstanding interview! / []
Hey.. Guess What.. It’s Tax time and there are a lot of people logging on to get their SSA1099.. You might be surprised how many do not have the form to complete their tax’s.. / []

What an Amazing, Awesome team! The best of the best giving back generously! Thank you each of you! THANK GOD EACH OF YOU GENTLEMEN! There is hope for America! / []
Instead of on Fake Fox News, Musk was asked to testify before Congress.  He cowardly decided to come here.  I have no respect for him. Plus, he's making a fortune in government contracts.  We don't need to go to Mars, and he should be paying the government for using our launch sites. / []
Elon is going to be looked back on as one of the greatest American heros in our history! What a time to be alive and witnessing this greatness in real time. / []
My total respect 😊 / []
My mother in law received a higher social security check. She called to make sure it wasn’t a mistake. It wasn’t 💫 / []
I love this man...Thank you Elon. / []
No ones against cutting waste but simply going off the word of a billionaire doesn’t hold weight. Show some numbers to verify what’s being cut, from where and explain how this will affect the American people. It’s that simple to gain support for these cuts but the way this is being done appears suspect. / []
The V.A. uses computers with less processing power than a new cell phone. Seriously. They literally have a Pentium II sticker on the side of the pc in my doctors office. Every visit they apologize because the computers are slow today. Bro. Your computers were slow in 2003. / []

When these guys have done this work to save our country Trump should award them all the congressional Medal of Honor.  These guys are as patriotic as the soldiers who protect us. / []
great work. / []
Elon and DOGE are American heroes and if you are against what they’re doing, you’re - by default - un-American. / []
This did happen to me,that is horrible and now if I want anything I have to go in there in person to get anything done.

If you’re like me, you don’t really have a visceral reaction to hearing the words million, billion, or trillion because we have no quantifying frame of reference, so let this sink in-  If we were to pay back our current debt (not including interest) at a rate of $1 every second, it would take 1,140,768 YEARS to do so. 🤯  Why does this information matter to us? Our debt greatly impacts a multitude of things including inflation and social security. If we don’t take significant action to sizeably reduce it, we’re going to get to a point where there is no chance of recovery. It’s definitely got my attention, how about yours? / []
Hey that national Park don't put food on the table I don't give a s*** about that national Park 🏞️ / []
DOGE IS A BIG BLESSING. Thank you, guys, for what you are doing. I am so appreciative of what you are doing. It is insane for people and critics who does not agree on DOGE. / []
Here’s the deal: these clowns harassing Tesla buyers, mostly their own tree-hugging crew, are acting like they’ve got a vendetta straight out of a serial killer’s diary. Meanwhile, Elon’s peeling back the curtain on government money pits, and the crooked bigwigs aren’t exactly throwing him a parade. Nope, they’re flipping the script. Once their green-tech golden boy, now he’s the bad guy du jour, much like Trump’s villain arc. Their pitch? Elon’s after your Social Security to pad his billions. Right, the dude who could blow a billion a day for centuries is sweating your shaky credit score. AOC and Sanders yell “evil rich” while feeding this nonsense to their cheering dimwits. Problem is, you can’t reason with thick skulls stuck on loop, parroting the same tired lines, boosted by the media, Hollywood, and The View’s brain trust of overcooked toast. Point’s clear: stupidity’s a tough nut to crack. / []

Funny, they claim to be applying commonsensical business practices. How many companies can survive by gutting revenue by $5 trillion?  DOGE is a joke. They’re cutting whatever offends a billionaire’s sensibility - first & foremost, a few bucks to save millions of lives from disease & famine, then grandma’s Social Security and Medicaid benefits.  Oh yeah, and if grandma complains, Elon knows she’s a fraudster. Interesting logic, similar to Soviet Russia. / []
We ❤️  Elon / []
Elon, I totally support what you and your DOGE staff are doing. So sad that the Left is attacking you with so many lies. Oh, We also own 2 Tesla's. Best cars we have ever owned. Please keep doing what you are doing and I hope in the end you get an award and proper recognition for your unselfish efforts / []

I apologize for all the ridiculous,  ungrateful Libs that have nothing better to do than complain. You have all put your lives on hold, for the good of the American people.

May God bless and protect all of you and your families 😊 / []
HOW incredible, humble and inspiring / []
Dear Fox, will you please convince the mainstream media to air this video in its entirety?  It will dispel the misunderstandings that the left leaning folks have about what DOGE is actually doing with Social Security.  This population probably won't view it on FOX because it doesn't jibe with their comfort zones. / []
When someone asks you how many days is it going to be before you leave then they are not on your side before the interview started in the first place. / []
Letting Elon clean up the financials of our government is legendary. This man doesn’t hold back at all. / []
This doesn’t surprise me but it scary as heck.    I do wonder how they are fixing the IT Systems.   Are they installing new corporate level systems that support each department with full data integration? / []
I haven’t seen a room filled with qualified and intelligent people at this level - merit based hires, in years! God does it stand out. I wish we had this team in Canada to clean house. I have no idea why people hate Elon. He’s incredible!!! / []

Love him or hate him, you can’t deny he’s doing an amazing job for Americans. I’m jealous. Wish we had an Elon in UK. / []
Listening from australia. A sincere and Patriotic effort by these Chaos and the Teams involved. Sadly , the corruption is endemic in Your Country. How many have been willingly corrupt ?

Thank you for bringing the DOGE team together. It’s a conversation that needs repeating & updating 👍 / []
Great job Elon and DOGE TEAM!!! Praying for you all for continued success in saving our country. May God be with you all!! / []
Thank you to all of you helping the American people, You are all awesome! God bless all of you! / []
When have you heard a politician say we do make mistakes?  That fact that Elon said that is what we need to focus on. / []
Call me I'd love to scan all this paperwork and give you a digital file! I told the Government 15 years ago it needed to be done! Stop useing Iron Mountain! / ['🤞🏾  hoping they cut IM out they been ripping the gov off for ages !!!']
Here's an idea to streamline your government. Have your president so his job instead of acting like some sort of nightclub lounge host pandering to the crowd, golfing constantly,  NASCAR events UFC events. What a joke. / []
Lol the sheep in these comments / []
What a great interview! / []
Just think democrats  were faking climate change ,the seasons are changing a bit, but Musk is lowering government spending and democrats can't stand it raising prices to fight climate change, doesn't make sense / []
Thankful for the outcome of this election results. Finally a Team with integrity and intelligence. mAGA 🙌 / []
Mission:  pillage the poor and give to the rich, otherwise known as corporate socialism. / []
The real question is how they will use the saved money? Perhaps giving tax cut to billionaires? If so, it does not resolve any issue. / ['Genius, what part of 30+ Trillion in debt do you not get ???', '@print4apet\xa0 perhaps you should read my comment again.', '@hasantao you make zero sense !  ( the saved payouts will reduce the debt, instead of adding to it over and over) are you that slow 🤔', '@print4apet\xa0 One of the key reasons for deficit is tax cuts to billionares. You are naive if you think they can resolve national debt without having both efficient government spending and fair tax policy.']
Can't believe I used to be a Democrat. The Liberals are awful & delusional, it's so embarrassing. I'm Center-Right more than ever before, so happy Trump won / []
These guys, along with all of the DOGE folks, are ALL GREAT AMERICANS 🇺🇲 Thank you all for what you are doing. Make America Great Again!!! / []
Love love love doge If I could just make one suggestion the guy sitting in the back second to the right with the highlights in his hair ditch the highlights Love you guys / []
As a 72 year old; I get calls almost every day trying to get me to do something, like agreeing to kits for this or that, services that medicare will pay for. I wish someone would ask us what all we have to fend off almost daily. It's scary. / []
Propaganda / []
Great interview / []
This interview—featuring its guests and host—might literally be one of the most important things a U.S. citizen could watch in recent history. I hope Fox promotes it across all platforms so more people see it. No politics, no nonsense—just issues that directly affect us, the people, our tax dollars, and how the rest of any and all government benefits that any of us will receive. / []
Great job Elon Musk....bravo! / []
Great Work DOGE Team / []
Good Deal 😊 / []
Thank you for your service to our country! / []
Trump, doge, homan , you need to come to Washington State / []
How can you balance the budget if you don’t know where the moneys going. i’m only a bread and butter Carpenter, but my God it seems like a pretty common sense approach and I don’t understand why this keeps continuing to be such a surprise. This is exactly what was promised during the election. We are starting to see a government that looks at fiscal responsibility as a business venture or beginning to experience, full transparency, and the elimination of in-house corruption. / []
Thank you all!!!! So grateful for you guys and the wonderful things you’re doing for this country. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Wow! This is a phenomenal interview.  They aren't 12 yr olds like we are led to believe. These are strong business v leaders putting their time in to save the USA and the citizens money.  I'm so greatly you put this out there so we can stop thinking it's an Elon scheme surrounded by pizza eating teenagers. Super proud of this crew's unapplauded deep dive. I love what they are doing.  True patriots. No malice. / []
Why do democrats keep lying? They are just addicted to lying. / []
The left and media that push lies against Elon, DOGE, and the President are truly Traitors to this country. / []
Fox owned by liberals and Bret Baier and Sean Hannity are c*ck s*ckers but the only game in town. / []
Wow / []
the waste of our money is shockingly wicked...thank you Team Doge...and can we PLEASE see some people go to jail for theft??? / []
Most important question needs to be answered....  Which one of them is BigBallz??? 😊 / []
The people screaming about Doge are not really worried about the 94 year old woman. They are worried about losing the money train!!!!!!! They are worried about their financial unapproved  bonuses! / []
THANK YOU FOR THIS. IT IS A GREAT ATEMPT TO SET THE RECORD STRATE .  WE THE PEOPLE ARE BEHIND DOGE.100% 👍😎 / []
You're kidding my gosh they don't even know what his job is / []
Bless all of you / []
I appreciate y'all. B blessed / []
Democrats are shameless liars. / []
Brilliant 🎉🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
Wow.  Just wow. / []
Canada needs DOGE! / []
I don't think Elon's DOGE work is alienating the Tesla owners who are Democrats. On the contrary, he is bringing them closer to Republicans. / []
👏👏👏👏👍🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️ / []
Elon looks beat down man. Poor dude / []
Very Good interview, I liked what he said about time.  Govt thinks DOGE is moving quickly & Musk thinks it is a little to SLOW.  These men want this done, they have companies to RUN! / []
Awesome job Elon. Your best interview yet. Keep it up, we love you!!! / []
❤LOVE THIS DOGE TEAM!!!❤hey everybody please ask JESUS into your heart today as your Lord and Savior while you still have time / []
Thank you Elon Musk and DOGE team for getting our Country’s Systems in alignment and preventing fraudulent activities from happening.  I am excited that Ai is going to be added to keep people honest. ❤ / []
So they just assume its a waste, then they cut it, and put the cash in their own pocket? Like where is the money now, that you safed, and what are U actually doing with it? Will the money be blown to mars? Buy more Starlink satelites? / ["After the cr it's still in the budget but considering they're gutting entire departments you can bet every penny saved gets stolen by these crooks somehow"]
I believe that God appointed Elon Musk to help president Trump to drain the swamp to make America great again ❤ / []
Is there an age limit for which you can start a business or can a parent start a business for a child and if he has a business is that legitimate / []
Astonishing reading all the comments full of people praising Elon’s selfless actions for the benefit of America. He doesn’t care aboht you, he cares about himself and the power he can gain for his own interests. Elon: ‘WE IDENTIFIED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 149 CLAIMING SOCIAL BENEFIT’. He just publicly told the word there were BILLIONS being wasted yet… it was a simple code flaw and he was incorrect. Does anyone have the humility to accept your amazing Elon can be wrong sometimes? / []
So this is the team killing Social Security so the Billionaires can get another tax break / []
It’s high time that the SSA receive updated computer systems, one that talks to each other as mentioned.  No business can run without an outdated system. Why is SSA any different?  Congress, what’s the holdup??? / []
Never in my wildest dreams did i think elon musk would become a big bully. Very dissapointed for i followed elon for years. A genius. Such a big shame!!!! / []
This is so great. More power to you DOGE! Thank you for your service. / []
These guys remind me of John Hancock signing the declaration. Risking it all because it was worth it. / []
True American heroes 🇺🇸 / []
it's amusing to see the US nailing capitalism. you go girl! lol / []
You  took 137 trillion from me and someone is scamming me still / []
I say this video will have over a million views by tomorrow. I wish everyone could watch it though. / []
I believe him. Everything that team touches turns to gold. Thank you guys so much. I hope DOGE never ends 🎉 / []
I don't know if he cares or not but I hope Elon realizes most of us are on his side.  Please keep up the good work. / []
How these democrats run this country into the ground is shameful / []
Elon, I would bet that 1/5 of Fed Gov employees all drive Teslas.  And I see them all over the place in the greater Washington area.  I think they are out there in numbers fighting against the far left in this regard just by driving them and have not seen any vandalism here.  Lefties also  drive Teslas.  So they're going to get pretty mad if their vehicles get vandalized.  We support you!  Keep up the good work. / []
God bless Elon and DOGE! / []
I love Elon amd DOGE.. so sad what ppl who formally propped him up just turned on him. / []
Federal Tax Free. / []
Oh let's not forget. How much money for fraudulent schools. Beyond billions . Which I had over a dozen schools shut down. But like wack a mole changed names & back in biz ness.  Elon musk the biggest problem is not exposing my Existence.... / []
Great interview.  I have so much respect for Elon and we should all be so grateful to him and his team, I sure am. / []
Thank you Elon Musk!  The left should watch this! / []
130days I wonder who the Democrats will blame after that. / []
Doge is amazing, wish we had that in Germany / []
Honestly, i cant wait for Elon to cut social security. Then Republicans will be pissed even more 🤣🤣 hey remember you voted for this. / []
If dog is doing the forensics auditing of finances of the financial government instead of upgrading its Data systems what are the specifics you got to get deep their accountants out there that tells me this is not for that forensic / []
Brilliant tha k you. / []
This is hogwash! A bunch of gobbley goop.... sincerely, all democrats 😂 / ['Bot, posting over and over !']
THATS A MOUNTAIN / []
No wonder why liberals are terrorizing and fear mongering people about social security…. They’re getting so many fraudulent payments!  Also love elons closing remarks on Ukraine and Russia! Well said / []
Mark of the Beast / []
Keep going guys. Thank you for your work. / []
Crazy theory:  The identity politics IS LITERALLY IN POLITICS. It's no wonder why the left kept pushing the identity ideology. BECAUSE YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF AS A 100 YR OLD AND GET MONEY FOR IT.   This is the very insistence in challenging the traditional belief of categories in identity. So that if they convince people enough, it will become acceptable for fraudsters to claim they are a certain identity to get government benefits. / []
yeah, trust the billionaires, they always have our best interest in mind 😑 / []
Cleaning House "No Where to Run No Where to Hide, DOGE is on a Roll"...Bless them All!!!! / []
For What???!!!!…why did so many people die????….finally someone saying the ridiculousness of the Ukrainian war….not just a superior genius but common sense humanitarian!…Go Elon!!!🇺🇸👍🏼💫 / []
If you believe he gave you 100% facts you are 100% in a cult / []
Guess what these billionaires will NEVER propose:  Tax increases for billionaires. / ['Please Tax The Wealthy Rich people!!', 'They aren’t there to increase taxes on anyone, they’re saving tax payers money.

You still scamming me / []
The left and their propaganda has gone far enough! The deep state and their shills need to go! / []
Elon - you are so disconnected with people who don’t have lots of money.  I’m not surprised with the backlash because you are hurting good people including those that voted Trump. / []
Democrats hate DOGE because the TRUTH is coming out! / []
Praise The Lord for these VERY APPRECIATED AND CAPABLE PATRIOTS!!! / []
No more taxes to pay for our government to waste or steal ! / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE!!!! / []
Thank you DOGE!!! Jesus loves you / []
Funny … the amoral left told us that Elon’s DOGE team was a bunch of teenaged computer nerds. I don’t see that characterization here. / []
It doesn’t matter what he finds he has no authority to do anything. / []
You are literally on a platform that pushes the lies and propaganda😂😂😂. And you’re smart, so you KNOW that.  You are the real evil! / []
Thankyou sir , god bless you more! / []
I love the transparency ❤😊 / []
God Bless you Elon and your team 🙏🙏🙏🙏 / []
The issue is that the people watching FOX agree with them but the ones who disagree don’t get to see it because their media only reinforces their own views, it’s like everyone is living in his/her own echo chamber / []
Thanks very much for your greatest and bravest work ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉True heroes! / []
These science are using all the facilities and such that go along with their being able to do research. / []

AND THE 300 MILLION THAT WAS GIVEN TO PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 120 WHERE WHAT SPAN OF TIME WAS THAT WHO WAS THE GIVEN TO CAN YOU DETECT WHERE THE MONEY WENT. THIS IS MY PROBLEM WITH DOGE KNOW SPECIFICS NO DETAILS / []
Thank you everyone at DOGE n God Bless you all… n Thank you President Trump for getting America back on track n God Bless you n your family n hope to see generations of the Trump family in office / []
Incredibly informative and excited of what they will find next.  MAGA! / []
They spent one billion dollar for survey? Whaaat? Gods bless Doge team… / []
I'm so glad that DOGE and FOX did this interview. I feel even better that I voted for this, Thank You to Elon and the entire DOGE Team! / []
This video needs to go viral and thats how us just the American people can do our part ... Please share this pod cast with everybody you can ... / []
Thank you Mr Musk for putting America first!  That is what our politicians should be doing but they are only interested in padding their pockets at the expense of the tax paying citizens in the U.S. which is why they are constantly war mongering.  Thank God for President Trump and his team. / []
Elon will be added to long list of Greatest Americans the USA has ever had! You are loved by millions of real Americans Elon! / []
Great interview… we need more of this. With the MSM only reporting the layoffs it’s good to hear why. Keep these interviews going! / []
Which one is 'bigballz', and who can i fire / []
Wait until Trump inflates the deficit by another 5 trillion / []
Thank you thank you Elon Musk and your DOGE team Amazing people ❤❤❤ / ['Thank you for what! Letting a South African immigrant take over Social Security. People are so stupid']

Excellent interview. “As a result of DOGE legitimate social security recipients will receive more benefits NOT less”. Do not believe what the democrats are saying. / []
Jk / []
why is it that just about anybody in this audience can see the sense and logic in this, but most of the democratic party not only misses the point they make up idiotic ideas about the reasoning behind it, sometimes the elephant is just that an elephant / []

I followed Elon closely for 10 years. Big fan, TSLA investor and I’m very confident when Elon says he’s going to make something work, he will be successful.  As much as I like and trust Elon, I’m glad to see he’s got a very senior, capable crew around him. That will make for a better outcome.   I worked in Silicon Valley my whole career and these guys know what they’re doing, especially when it comes to cyber crime.  I’ve thought for several years that my next car will likely be a Tesla. What’s happening to Elon makes me more resolved to own a model 3! How ‘bout u? / []
Per me for great government functionality and efficiency this new DOGE govenment agency must function all year arround all times in order make sure that government is not overspending. Its a new great thing. / []
May the divine protect these men, for they will go through severe scrutiny and defamation in order to complete their divine mission. For the situation is far more complex than it seems. They are truly fighting evil and most people haven’t awaken to it until it happens to them.For people reject truth because it doesn’t fit the comforting lies they are been told. / []
The other dark side of this is, is the cover-up and why aren’t there any arrests? / []
Like straight up m.......u...r..derd / []
Wow top notch team is helping Americans / []
They should’ve done this interview 2 months ago / []
This is so good. Hoping everything works out as exactly as planned and intended. God bless them. / []
My grandfather passed away at 8pm at night his social security check was deposited in his account at 12:00am eastern time by 9:00am eastern time the following morning his deposit was pulled back his body wasn't even cold yet and that was 10 years ago under Obama administration.  I can only speak of my situation and yes I voted trump both times and support government cuts to save American tax payers money / []

This is Exactly what the US has needed🎉 / []
They may be listed on social security,  but are they receiving a cheque? / []
Its not just the myopic Baby Boomers, its other generations coming up that need to see social security solvent and have benefits when they get to retirement age. / []
That's happening everywhere that's happening at my bank they have so many systems the other one doesn't tell the other one it's a mess over here in California / []
I’ve been fixing major tech problems since the 90s and not only do I never get really paid well for it. I also never get credit but whatever that’s just how this country has been. That’s why they give away money to people who can’t do anything and people like me you have to just keep working since they were young. I wasn’t even allowed to go to school. I had to do that on my own. / []
Share this video with everyone you can. No more letting the thieves steal our hard earned money! The more we know, the more we can demand that we are relevant. Thank you gentlemen for your help. 💪💯💪 / []
Congress has requested Elon to present his findings to them. Explan your actions to them. The waste goes to the taxpayers not Billionaires. / []

And as for the 6 year old with loans have there  parent been arrested and who gave the loan out for approval in the first place?  Maybe the kid has his or her own Youtube channel that was successful.

Firstly, what are their names? I don't believe he is 'Major Account'! The second in command, on the right hand side, says 'working with a great cabinet and a great group'; this is pure Trump speak, no intelligence in the sentences, only 'great', 'wonderful' 'amazing' ie 'JOB'! He then says, 'you can see it on the 'DOGE' website for maximum transparancy...they're not IN REAL TIME, (what kind of talk is that???), but you can't see it now, in a couple of weeks', ie in 'real time' but in the future? The guy, just looking at his eyes, is a 'space cadet', and judging by his hair, 'LONG GONE'! Elon, you haven't been elected, Congress has ultimate power over all those elected, AND THOSE who are not elected, but barge in through multiple buildings and then say to the security, 'we're going in...' AND THE SECURITY DOES! Elon: "...How can you live to 150 yrs..." YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, YOU SHOULD KNOW all programmes go to '...= 0' or '...= 150'. I believe you do not have a clue about programming at all! The employees will 'get more money'! You Have SACKED THEM from their jobs! Interviewer: '...is it going to affect people...' Elon: 'for the better'. They've ALL lost their jobs! FBI, CIA, etc...ALSO all eight men, do show YOUR names! Who the hell are these people? What status/grade and background allows them to take over the Federal...? Where is 'Big Balls', and his fellow kids...? One last...ALL your crowd pillory 'Europe', lack of democracy and media, etc. But in all our 20th and 21st centuries, we have NEVER had such a bunch of utter charlatans conning, not just America, but trying to 'con' the world! "...and the kids don't have a father, and for what..." BECAUSE DUMBO, the Russians took 20,000 children (some say as much as 40,000 plus) away from the Ukraine, back to RUSSIA, braindead; or Russian lackey! / []

The Critics are the ones not getting the money😂 / []
This would be so much more believable on just about any network other than Fox. Trump admin and DOGE need to start doing interviews on neutral or left-leaning networks if they are going to be taken seriously by anyone other than MAGA. Fox exclusives are devoid of real value. / []
Keep going! Great job Elon and the DOGE TEAM 👏👏👏🇺🇸👍 / []
Who is that in the background at the end. / []
We already know the government is wasteful and inefficient. Congress has done nothing and will do nothing to fix it. / []
Very powerful words from Elon at the end 38:20  “FOR WHAT? NOTHING!”  Well said man. / []
Elon, you are the man God bless you and thank you for everything that you do for our country / []
Amazing wonderful team!! Thank you! ❤️🇺🇸🎉 / []
I think he is doing an absolute wonderful job!❤ / []

How can anyone be against this? Thanks team / []
All Elon is doing is trying to figure out how he can add his technology and obtain contracts with the government. Since Tesla will be no more in the coming years. He is not helping the government at all. People have to understand Systems are one thing but trying to use the right system, and keeping your data safe is whole another ball park. Just Google how Japan works an keep their data safe. Japan mostly use paper for everything and its 2025, they haven't had a data breach in years. The USA want everything fast and cry when their SSN get stolen or their banking account wiped out due to scammers. Learn how things work before commenting on what is happening with ELON ... Elon is only here to gain access to contracts and power. / []
Imagine a government organization trying to do this. It would take over a century to complete with a budge of several trillions of dollars. I bet Elon and his crew complete it by year's end, at the latest, and at a cost of maybe a million bucks or so. Even if it costs a BILLION dollars to fund, it's the biggest bargain in human history! Personally, I'd like to see each of the DoGE team members given a bonus or $10M, minimum. It would mean nothing to Elon, but to the regular people doing all of this work, and having to endure the slings and arrows from the communists, it would be a very well-deserved paycheck. Hell Trump could even initiate his equivalent of a GoFundMe project to get taxpayers like me to voluntarily pay for it. Each IRS form has a checkbox to let you deduct $3 for Presidential elections. How about another checkbox, this one for a $10 deduction that goes to the DoGE bonus kitty? I'd gladly do it! Most taxpayers, other than the communists, would as well. / []
Don’t worry Elon Us REAL AMERICANS  BACK YOU 100% / []
The people never cared and never asked what systems are running government infrastructure. NEVER. Suddenly, they are technology experts.  These democrats are absolute LIARS and frauds. / []
Democrats didn't complain when Bill Clinton did it!!! / []

So proud! / []
It is unconstitutional for anyone to make budget changes without Congress. / ["No, it is not. The President has the authority to cut jobs, spending, and waste! The only thing that has to go through Congress is if a complete department is eliminated. Stop listening to the hate and lies from the deranged democrats! It's really sad that people can't see through their hate!"]

Great job everyone! / []
Elon is weird but man it makes since. Nerd democrats how could you not get on board with this its ok your family still loves you after covid and the last few years holidays😂😂😂 / []

Elon...  What a smart guy! / []
Team Musk is going to have lots of enemies whos kickbacks will be put in jeopardy or outright targeted who syphon off funds very very possibly and in actual effect right this second👀 I have seen it at ground level corporations 🗣can you imagine on National and Global levels the Gold Pot of corruption is huge and minions have their eyes, minds and hearts on that👉 we are talking about $,×××,×××,×××,×××,×××+ / []
Brett does a great job with all these big interviews / []
I wish we could stream this at the next big game. Legacy Media refuses to show it. It's a disservice to Americans. These men are true Patriots. So grateful. / []
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE MAD AT ELON! Thank you sir you’re a great patriot! / []
I did try and move my bank and have you ever tried that because it's like 10 steps if you're on the laptop to find out how to do it I tried to change my notes getting from disability instead of having them mail to me by the way I was out for a year and told I wouldn't have to sign a thing but because they oh my God they did that all purpose. Because they weren't doing it right I was getting checks over 5K I actually prefer to have it every other week like a normal person does. I know it's going on you've got these people on YouTube with all of their rhetoric on Social Security and lies they're picking up from everybody else and they're scaring people / []
GOD BLESS Elon Musk and his TEAM. They came at the right time and right place in History. / []
Oh ,, the black community is gonna have to find some new scams ! / []

Thank you DOGE team❤ / []
Thank you for common sense / []

Please tell Elon to stop drinking out of plastic, it is not healthy, his children and we need him. / []
Trump is a White Supremacist?? Gee, why did he pick Omarossa to win The Apprentice?? Why did he promote Mike Tyson? Why did he roll in limosines with Don King and Dennis Rodman? Why did his beloved daughter mary a Jewish man??? / []
Thank you each person on this team and their desire and experience to try to fix the system. / []
Amazingly good ! / []
Thank you DOGE team!  Carry on gentlemen! ❤ / []
Yes, contempt for such people! Well annunciated! / []
God bless the Doge Team!! / []
I would check in and find if a person with a card they put in computer to check in if they are working. I heard they were leaving their card in as if they are working, when they are not. / []
Why do people believe the Dems still?  It's pure insanity. They're still believing Doge is stealing. 🙄 Honestly, someone should sue Legacy media for lying. / []
Please everybody share this with your family your friends so they know what's going on with our government and the corruption that both parties has done over the years. I pray that these men have the strength and ability to fix our problems in our country. / []
More brain cells in 1 room than across our entire government over the last 4 years. / []
"Get the computers talking to each other". Sounds pretty simple really! (Not that I could do it but there will be people who can.) / []
I thought doge was a bunch of teenagers? / []
We all should be thankful to Elon. / []
Only the future will know if he's good at ending wars and suppression. I hope .✌️🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠👽 / []
Thank you so much for saving America 🇺🇸!!! God Bless  you and your families!!! / []
Man I love this new government! I thought I would never say those words in my lifetime. Makes me proud to be an American, keep up the good work. 😊 / []
Wow, when was the last time we saw this many competent people working on a government project? / ['1776?']
I so admire Elon and his team on what they are doing for our Country. Folks that disagree will have a change of heart when they reach their goal. Its for us all remember that! / []
Yeah, but you want to go back to voting in one day without any machines involved. I'm confused. / []
Go Doge! Buy a Tesla! Protect Musk!  The world would be so boring without this brilliant man hahahaha / []
The DOGE Team is “we the people”. / []
Elon learn not to interrupt.  Thank you ! / []
First! / []
The right doing it right...and the left being left behind. / []
Interesting that a congressional approved organization is executing the law at the discretion of the commander in chief and to the best of their abilities. I guess we will just have to see what the courts have to say about it though! / []
This was extremely informative / []

Proud of the teams and pray for peace and understanding soon. 🙏 / []
Thank you all❤ / []
The American government has been acting like a business since the constitution it isn't even part of the USA the people who live there dont have representation or able to vote it's a country within a country that's why it's been hiding corruption ever since. USA might have changed the laws of their country with a constitution but they didn't change the laws of the land and Britain has legal documents that are older than than the constitution that they likely still have rights to a lot more than Americans know just like in Canada we just didnt lie to our people about where the debt was going / []
No DEI 😂 / []
Everyone should watch this program and understand how and why our beloved country will go bankrupt if DODGE was not there. Thank you guys, thank you Elon, thank you President Trump🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✊✊✊ / []
This is THE BEST / []

Absolutely amazing interview! / []
As a retired accountant, this is alarming, however it sounds as though the D.O.G.E team with Elon Musk are taking the bull by the horns. It seems the USA is heading in the right direction. May God guide these people to complete the job. Especially on the technology side or government will loose track again. / []
absolutely amazing that somebody would devote their time and energy to making sure we have a future in this country actually, we have a prosperous country. This is what I’ve been saying, all along a communication to the public in a simple format, not rocket scientists to the public that the majority of us don’t understand makes things and breaks it down for everyone to understand, and I could almost guarantee you the public will have a much more positive opinion of Doge after this . they’re all amazing. It’s not just Elon Musk. I mean he is amazing of course but all of them deserve our sincerest gratitude. Thank you again for everything. You guys are absolutely amazing and I have a feeling very soon. The few loudmouths that are crying are soon gonna start realizing this is for their best interest. The only ones that aren’t gonna be the ones that got caught with their hands in the cookie jar and maybe from prison they can start all of their big mouth crying. trust me it’s both sides of the aisle. It’s not just one side, but I give a lot of credit to President Trump for making sure that this followed through just like he promised on his campaign trail even with all the resistance he still was going at it President Trump and Elon Musk deserve a lot of praise / []
The comment about NIH funding was wrong. The researchers will not get more money. They will be fired because universities refuse to reduce administrative costs. / ['🍿🥤🎥']
Brave men . / []
I am crying watching this when they ask why tgese guys doing this!

You are truly patriots !! God protect you and keep your family. / []
Scary how the democrats can’t get on board with this administration and save the American people money / []
When you listen to Elon speak like this it’s so hard to believe people are losing their minds over this. When we are the richest nation and most unhealthy and our kids are doing so bad in school , people are mad at Elon and Trump / []
This is just FANTASTIC news!! We owe such a debt of gratitude to these fine Americans! / []

Democrats who try to bash DOGE have clearly not watched this interview.  This team's work is exactly what Democrats of multiple decades in the past would have not only encouraged, but applauded. / []
Thank you Elan and team for the great work. / []
Best interview ever, this has only made me more of a supporter of Elon and Trump. Thank God / []
Stop it with the far left stuff.  They are upset at the way DOGE was rolled out and not following existing laws.  The violence is wrong, but you have to understand the anger across the country. / ["Explain it then.  You didn't say anything."]
Thanks for following the money DOGE! / []
I agree however that the government does take in Revenue like a business but they spend it like a non-profit this format cannot continue / []

This is so cool. Honestly I  think I want to be an American / ['💯👍']
No matter the naysayers and the propaganda, history will look favorably on these men.   Be patient fellow Americans.

Hope I am alive to see how the history books will recognize these Patriots / []

Do all these highly skilled programming and tech rich men stand to gain anything for making all these changes? Just wondering? / []

Just a thought.. This news and interview is so useful and compelling... But imagine sharing this interview with no FOX new logos, or banners... I know Fox wants to watermark their exclusive content... But also imagine the number of people who dismiss what is being said here simply for the fact that in their mind,  'Fox" is the enemy / []
Love Elon ❤😊 / []
The dem's need to stop / []
👍outstanding ! / []
Honestly, this is about on par for what I expected. I’m glad they’re going through and cleaning it up. The problem is, are we going to be able to maintain it after these guys are gone? I’m sure the fraudulent bureaucrats will be rushing back in as soon as the first opportunity presents itself. / []

Thank you so much for this segment Bret!!! A HUGE thank you to Elon & the entire DOGE team for helping all of us.

..........remember........ during the campaign and just after the elction ....the stated goal and what trump and musk said was that they would find $ 2 trillion in savings  . / []
This was well presented & I'll admit I have NEVER said that about a FOX show.  Of course only the good was highlighted & no one is ignorant enough to not know that bad will also happen. There are always unintended consequences. ..but thanks for putting this together . You look a bit more human ,Elon, in my eyes. Good Luck. / []

When you privatise the govt depts - yes, you make it ruthless, and people feel threatened. But that is exactly what every private company employees have to live with- it's normal.

People are happier if they use their brains and achieve higher goals. / []

The important thing about paper storage in those (salt) mines the information are safe & not tampered through changing administrations. Paper access, read and follow-through with local electric grid, not threatened by the national grid or possible attack, etc., the mines are controlled environment. The problem with digitizing everything is the possibility of it the electrical systems going down. Even Ai has analyzed that. There are many of us that experienced total loss of information due to discs gone bad. I hope they keep the paper backup. Just fix the elevator, that's not such a big fix, it is the human resource departments that have removed the personal departments, paper records are not overwhelming.

With these changes all I see is a better economy no matter which way you look at it. Thank you Elon Musk and your team. I appreciate every single one of you. The false narrative out there is Elon Musk is stealing money from the government and that's just outrageous. They tend to forget he's one of the richest man if not the richest man in our country he doesn't need to steal anybody's money thank you. / []
Thank you DOGE!!! / []
We are so blessed to have all these guys ….Thank you from the bottom of our hearts !!! / []

WOW.  I’m an Independent.  The only dog I have in this fight is the betterment of the country, and it appears that we’re on that path.  I have to say this interview was incredibly eye-opening as to what has been going on.  I’m stunned right now.  I hope all parties can get on board to make our country more efficient and sustainable for the benefit of the people. / []

Again where is the proof, this idiot just spouts crap with no evidence other than trust us. Example they have taken many receipts of savings down because they inflated the numbers. / []
I am so impressed with this team and so very hopeful that they will find the the waste and abuse.  I am so encouraged after hearing this interview.  Thank you Elon and DOGE team!!! / []
Did you notice something? Most of them have the "Musk stutter." Why? Because it's an actual, outward, manifestation of high-functioning intelligence. Of course it's not always true, but this is a generalality. / []
This is exactly why the democrat party is like a cult, they cant hear anything anyone say`s unless it is coming out of a democrat megaphone. The democrats are preprogrammed like bots from the main stream propaganda media. / []

This was actually a very good look into the people behind doge and their mentalities, and elon is as awesome and inspiring as always. I hope this all works out the way they say they want it to, that will mean great prosperity for the usa after many years of heavy burdens of blood and money / []

Congress moves at the pace of a snail! Useless on both sides! It's time they get out of the past, slim their bills to move them faster, and finally put term limits on themselves! There is NO NEED for a full-time congress in 2025! They do nothing but have pointless hearing about things that don't matter! Both sides. Make them part-time, pass whatever they do, and go back to where they came from and live by what they passed! Most states do it that way! / []

"Shouldn't take a rocket scientist" But i sure am glad we have a couple of them doing this. The thing is what they are doing is nothing new except for the transparency part. Auditing the Fed is something that has happened in the past and should take place more often. Only difference right now is dems and libs losing there cash cow, which has never had to happen before in history. I could be wrong but never before has anyone questioned who was doing the auditing. We are fortunate that we have who we have doing it. Because he's made it transparent. It's unthinkable/unreal that so many people oppose this. I suspect there is some nefarious agenda behind the opposition. / []
The people who criticize Elon should be ashamed of themselves. He clearly has zero malice in his heart. It’s really not that deep and he’s doing the best he can / []

I'm so happy for this group of men that are saving this country. It can be done as long as it can't be undone. If this interview makes people mad then there is no hope for you 😢. Saying this, for those of you who are 30 and younger the fault is not yours because our Government allowed common sense to be stripped from education and yes both parties are at fault. Stop watching the news that your taxes pays for. Imagine that we pay the media to lie to us. Thank you Fox, Bret, and I hope the people get educated. PS. Bret, Mr.Astronaut is a big disappointment to common sense and because you don't see this I know you are still a die hard Democrat. One day you will understand, I hope. / []

Discipline and emotional maturity play a significant role in achieving success.

With insights from Isabella Fanucchi and my commitment to learning and growth, I've been increasing my earnings in just a few months. Keep up the good work. / ["Over the years, I've been a part of numerous trading programs, sifting through a barrage of information.

I spent hours all day calling to see how did you get my information no right now I'm still getting phone calls on a phone on a number I changed 6 months ago / []
We have 90% regular people of the population, 5% middle class, 5% which people. Every cut and every change that Trump made to his term affected the 90% of the population. therefore you vote for it and as a result of the consequences is you pay for it. So shut up and do not complaint,. You get what you vote for.  Mr Trump make it clearly in his campaign if you vote for him and wi . He will make sure that every bad things to his voters. So you vote for it and deal with it. / []
Hold on to your paper receipts. / []

People who are ideologically lost forget that Elon is doing this for free. He’s not getting government favors for this, he’s not enriching himself. He’s basically taken a full time job for no money.

Liar, stealing from American citizens / []
I dare the lefties to watch this. Impossible! They only live off of MSNBC sounds bites. / []
No one is going to disagree that the bureaucratic flab of excessive government spending needs to be put in check. That's not the issue.  What IS an issue is an unelected businessman being given this much unchecked control.   And ask yourselves this: WHY is Musk so enthusiastic about this project? Because, as a businessman, his key priority is to make money. And what will all of the dollars DOGE "finds" be used to fund? This administration's tax plan which disproportionately benefits corporations and the wealthy, like Elon here.   Doing it out of the goodness of his heart to make the lives for everyday Americans better? I honestly doubt that. / []
This commnetator is not a an authentic journalist!  Lol  But any how!  Smh! / []
The citizens of the US have never heard this much TRUTH before at once from smart, committed, competent, truth tellers. And this IS revolutionary.  Elon's right. As a taxpayer, I'm very thankful for DOGE.  The Dems are unfortunately, doing what they've done for too long. Twisting the facts and fearmongering. And also unfortunately, much of MSM is helping the Dems spread their lies and misinformation to their constituents. MSM consists of paid actors and talking heads.

Thank you so much Mr Musk & the entire DOGE team for your hard work & dedication. God bless you all & families! 🙏❤️ / []
Thank You D.O.G.E.! / []
Elon is so compassionate to saving lives and savinget the world. Solutions not words. People over money. Good over evil. It's a huge impossible task. Elon isn't even mad at the protesters. That's a big heart. Such a good man and a hero to America. / []
thank you, Elon, thank you  DOGE you are heroes. / []
From the bottom of my heart, thank you all so much for caring enough to make a difference! / []
Superb! Gratitude for these men! / []
I would like to ask Elon for a loan so I can Make Maine Great Again! and also FINALLY move out of my moms for GOOD and repay her for all her generosity / []
Wow!! I just want to say Thank You to Elon, the gentleman with Doge tonight, all others with Doge and in the people in Trump's administration! God Bless you and America loves you!!!! ❤️ 🇺🇲 / []
Such BS / []
Awesome / []
Fantastic.  The world will benefit hopefully, observing the revolution taking place in the USA and learn the lessons for mankind and the planet.  Unforgettable Elon  and D Trump for allowing truth to flourish. / []
Thank you DOGE team!!!! / []
Thank you for allowing these man to speak. This is truly a revolution / []
There hasn't been any over site for decades. What the heck do you think all my sacrifices where about.  The future. My kids & my secret history blood line . Which your acting as if I don't EXHIST & that is pissing me off & still hurting me & my kids. / []
DOGE Team!🫡🇺🇸 / []
Defunding food banks❓ how is that good for America ❓ / []
Excellent show ❤ / []
They’ve only found $580 million at DOD AND THE LATEST CR BY THE REPUBLIC PARTY ADDED 6 BILLION TO THEIR BUDGET / []
🙏💙😇🌏👍 / []
I thank the people in Doge for all you are doing. I support you 100% / []
A true threat to Bureaucracy 👏 / []
Excellent! / []
People should thank Elon for even taking into consideration the way he feels about our government spending!❤🎉 / []
Jimmy Dore needs to watch this because he has gone bonkers buying leftist propaganda about SSA. / []
After listening to this, what other fairy tails would you like to hear? / []
All these leftist media podcasts and news outlets have to be held accountable. Podcast leftist are liers and they are pushing hate and terrorists! Free speech doesn't mean you can call for hatred to attack people or business. CNN MSNBC ABC CBS they have to be held accountable / []
Wow the government employee have 4.3 millions credit cards unbelievable for 2.3 millions employee. / []
DOGE is needed everywhere! / []
No liberal would dare to look at the proof because they can't argue with it. / []
When was the last time the deficit went down? / []
And when are prosecutions going to happen to these fraudsters? It can’t be that hard to follow the money and name and shame these people. / []
Keep up the awesome work! ❤ Americans love you! Well most of us😅. / []
Thank you President Trump and Elon Musk and all the men in that room . / []
Thank you Mr Musk / []
lol and nobody’s getting anything lol / []
Thank you Bret - that was a FANTASTIC INTERVIEW WITH THE DOGE TEAM.  I learned soooo much and really understood what they are doing and trying to do to make sure America does not go bankrupt!!!!  That would be a world wide disaster!!!!  NOW THAT THE TESLA BOMBER HAS BEEN CAUGHT AND WE KNOW HE IS A MEMBER OF CCP (COMMUNIST PARTY) THAT HELPS WITH UNDERSTANDING WHO IS PUSHING THE AGENDA WITH TERROR ATTACKS!!! / []
It's laughable. Everything they produced was retracted. The funds given to Musk are also overvalued, just like the way the government operated. / []
Sorry but nobody pays $290 million to play HR department for a government.  Elon needs government contracts to save his company. / []
This team got to work just in time!   Thank you! / []
If I could meet Mr. Musk I would say Thank You.  You are very nice and caring man.  If feel that you are a hero.  I don't think you want to be a hero, but you are. / []
Thanks to each & everyone of you. Wonderful & informative interview. / []
Id like to point out the fact that Elons response to attacks on Tesla was a simple answer—yet his response to ending war, was with such conviction.  This says to me, that he is far more passionate about lives being lost, than he is in his own company; his own personal gains.   Much respect. / []
WHAT A GREAT TEAM OF MEN IN DOGE!! They ‘ALL’ deserve medals & several weeks 😆 of vacation time, at their chosen destination, cost free, after their work is done! But I think they are all men that probably wouldn’t even take it. An amazing group of men! Wow! Hats off to Elon Musk & the DOGE team! The work they are doing is unheard of in America!! Shame on ALL those who are doing the inhumane deeds against them! Disgusting!🙅🏻‍♀️🥇🏆👏🏼👏🏼💪🏼❤️🤍💙🇺🇸 / []
Go doge team!!!🎉 / []
I don't see not one black or brown person on Elons team . Tell me why / []
Thank Musk / []
Can we senior citizens get an increase on our income?  For the last four years we have been getting the super minimun of about 20.00 dolkars every January!  Then the medical ins. Would increase and the utilities and food wipes us out!  Can there be a grand belated increase, please!  Thank you fir listening and doing something about it. ❤️ / []
16:47 Bret: 40? LOL / []
Awesome, awesome work! Thank you, Elon Musk. Keep up the good work. / []
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COURAGOUSE EFFORTS AND COMMITMENT TO SERVING WE THE PEOPLES BEST INTEREST🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸🙏 / []
Undoing everything the previous governments have allowed to steal from the people and give to the rich. Good Job Elon. / []
DOGE is truly a revolution, taking place in this many life-times. It will go down in history as one of America's greatest achievements. I would venture to say that DOGE-copy can not be duplicated to another country. I'm so lucky to be cognitive enough to witness this remarkable phenominon. Thank you DOGE team for your noble work. You all are my heroes. / []
THE LEFT ARE FEAR MONGERS AND THEIVES!!!!!  THEY HAVE NO SHAME!!! / []
The democrat Anti American party needs to disband at this point. DOGE finding 4 billion In erroneous spending a day?! What in the name of fuk 🤡💩💩 / []
Awesome show / []
Undoing everything the previous governments have allowed to steal from the people and give to the rich. Good Job Elon. / []
So good 💙💜💚💛💙💜💚💛💙💜💚💛 / []
Just wonderful work and very, very patriotic / []
Please can we have a DOGE team like this in the UK? / []
I love how much Elon despises virtue-signalers. / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team! / []
Their multi-pronged approach is cruel and unusual punishment of the American people. We didn't vote for this ‼️ / []
DOGE is a remarkable endeavor. In the annals of history it will prove to be one of the most successful financial renovations the world has ever seen. The economic version of Justinians Codification of Roman Law. 👍👍 / []
GOD BLESS THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE HARD WORK YOU ARE ALL DOING FOR AMERICA🇺🇸✨️💯 / []
Okay Elon, you should hire me! I applied to work for DOGE didn’t hear anything! You need a woman on that panel. 😆😬 I specifically spent 4 years of my career in a place to find out what’s happening with our taxes! I gave up a big salary for that! It’s mind blowing how the tax payer’s money it’s been used 😒 / []
Geeks created civilization / []
Great job 🎉🎉 / []
Democrat voters will NEVER see the information put out in this interview, and democrat politicians will continue to lie to their sheep. / []
Wow very  efficient 🎉🎉 / []
Great interview, the American people need to understand what  Doge is doing and why they’re doing it . These people are patriots and deserve our full support and respect for doing this for our beloved country. / ['They are not patriots.  They are workers being paid by taxpayers']
Thank you Bret and Fox for giving DOGE and the American-loving people a voice! Everywhere else are those fraudsters complaining and attempting to stop them from helping the government to be more efficient.  Please keep ip the good work❤ / []
God bless DOGE and President Trump ✝️✝️✝️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
This is an incredible team ! DOGE is really helping save this country from bankruptcy. Thank you all for your efforts and work to this monumental task . / []
Whilst I agree that there is massive waste. You are working with no oversight whatsoever and seem to think that you posting incorrect facts on your DOGE website is showing ‘accountability’. So, we have no idea whether you’re siphoning it all off into your own bank account. We wouldn’t have a clue. / ['Did the voice in your head tell you their facts were incorrect']
One of the most eye-opening interviews I've seen. These guys are giving up so much to fix a completely broken and fraudulent system. Yet the Corrupt Corprate Press and their Deep State Democrat partners are throwing out Propaganda everywhere. / []
Thank you DOGE! / []
this is an awesome group of sincere patriots. / []
I never thought I would watch a video where Elon is the least Autistic man in the room. / ['😂', 'Spot on 😂']
Every American should be required to watch this.  Thank you to these wonderful Americans for the work they're doing. / ['Many of the sheep would need to take their blinders off, and most never will. Sad.', 'Musk isn’t American and they’ve giver no proof', 'Agreed!', 'This should be in every history, economics high school class in the country to watch this!', "I bet MSM isn't gonna cover this story. But I'm pleased with the amount of views your show is receiving."]
All public corporations beed DOCE  Dept of Corporate Expense control with outside Operatives! Who are smart like Musk and impartial! / []
Eventually Trump will make a deal with China that will allow Chinese EVs.  That day Elon’s company will collapse.  The deal will be a win for the U.S. government as another revenue stream. / []
As time passes it’s become so apparent how dangerously close our country came to a destruction we could never recover from. These democrats should scare the hell out of everyone. / []
Bravo and thanks gents / []
Musk.  Is man of the century. / []
Not sure. I believe all this. Why would Elon Musk a millionaire? Want to bother and Trump is not a smart man. Sorry business man but can't run a country. He's racist and has dictator attitude. So I'm hoping they mean what they say. Causein's country is in trouble and has been for a long time. And we Americans who need our social security.  Have worked our senior years are not gonna be deprived of these idiots because they wanna go to maurice that's all i'm saying / []
This really answered many of my questions. Elon is doing a huge contribution to the US, he is a patriot. My only remaining doubts are related to his understanding of foreign policy, especially his despise of Ukraine's President and his vulnerability towards China. Great job Fox / []
It’s a requirement for congress to be involved 😮 / []
Thanks / []
I want to personally say thank you to everyone for all the hard work you are doing for us the American people ❤you guys thank you so much / []
These guys are patriots… God Bless them all / []
How anybody can be against this is absolutely mind-boggling / []
These are real patrons / []
Not gonna lie all the guys sitting down looks stressed and tired if no one will say it I will thanks you guys for the hard work and hope it turn out good for everyone 🤔 / []
Trump is not good in stopping wars, he already got a lot of people killed ...  nonsense. All see how the administration is ruining the nation in every way, through incompetence. Supporting the concepts of independence and liberty is a good thing. Would you offer half of Alaska if Russia grabbed that? / []
All the political capital gained by DOGE will be for nothing. Trump puts Israel first and he will go down in history as just another tool of the Deep State / []
Inspirational / []
Will you feel the same way once your Social Security and Medicaid is cut?? Do you feel having services at the Social Security office is essential are you feel reducing those workers are essential needs? Will you feel the same way once your taxes go up? How long of pain do you wait before you finally realize you’ve been lied to / []
Every single US citizen that is against DOGE, should not be allowed to be a US citizen. They are literally doing the work of the Founding Fathers - keep the Government as small, efficient, and limited as reasonably possible. / []
I appreciate your introducing the world to the team mgmt. For me atleast is brought down my fears considerably. It felt believable when the team honestly discussed deficiencies having occurred for a 1/4 century.. that tracks with nonpartisan, gvmt waste belief so to speak. Then, Mr. Musk deflated much of my relief balloon when he hammered the incompetency directly on Biden. You totally lost me again. Please respect the time, commitment and security of the people you just exposed to the world. I really need to believe in a healthy, civil outcome at the end of this. / []
What a lucky people we are to have someone like Elon on our side!  We don’t deserve this man! / []
Thank you all!  This is awesome 🤩 / []
lol the government is 80yrs behind the times lol, even Ikea is usually 10yrs behind lol, catch up Dems lol / []
Heroes / []
That team is the dream team. They will be the undefeated superbowl team of all time. They are the olympians of the world. What a wonderful time to be alive and watch this unfold in real time at that. / []
Batshitcrazy....totally against our Constitution.... / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team. / []
And of course.. democrats oppose it. Even the voters, why would ANY American tax payer not want to know where their tax dollars are going? I know in california it sure as hell ain't towards our roads and infrastructure... / []
Thank you to everyone at DOGE. Thank you to President TRUMP and Elon 33:13 for your sacrifice. / []
I support everything Elon and these men are doing. For years, I've heard from both parties that America will go bankrupt. The IRS and SSDI systems are prehistoric. President Trump is trying to fix all this, and you have all these insane liberials creating chaos. I can't believe how much waste/abuse there is in our government. Our money.  This needs to end. / []
35:00 Call him Ozzymandias from Watchmen. / []
Show the evidence. Any one can say whatever they want. Show and prove. All this talk is hot air until then. / ['He told you , go to the website .']
Thank you DOGE team, godspeed. / []
This was so interesting to listen to. Appreciate getting dispelled a lot of the misinformation. So grateful for this whole team for what they are doing. They deserve medals! / []
As a Russian bot, i approve this video / []
the whole thing gives one hope. / []
I think any decent citizen would love the opportunity to stop wasteful spending in the government.  Now that we have somebody who is trying to set the record to do just that there is opposition from those who want to continue the gravy train and keep it in place.  I commend the people who are readily trying to keep this country intact and all the freedoms we are allowed to enjoy.  These protestors that threaten business and workers should be ashamed of themselves.  My thanks to all who are sacrificing to make our country more secure and prosperous for the future.  This is very important because taking something for granted could be all gone and wiped away.  That is not right as many people died to build the US up to what it is today. Some things not nice but one outweighs the other.  There is no reason to understand those who wish to tear it apart as it is wiser to make sure they cannot. Like my grandmother use to say there is always that opportunity to be ten steps ahead and well prepared with no excuse to stay on top of what is important.  She never quit once in her lifetime. / []
What a great bunch of guys! Go DOGE.? I understand it all so much better! / []
Imagine how the people who are crying now would sound if it all came crashing down. This must be done. We are broke. / []
🇺🇸❤️💪🏻🥰🎸❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Saving lives and America / []
Elon is using his position in the government to make contracts with in programs and getting rid of other programs that’s getting in his way. He’s a corrupted and he’s acting like he’s saving you people when in reality he’s just destroying you people. And just like you thought egg prices was going down. Not even your taxes will lower they’ll just go up stupids / []
The crazy man Elon should be loved by the Liberals. He has done more for this country in a few months than the past 10 administrations combined. You go Elon and staff and thank you for tossing your lives down the drain to save us little people. / []

Thank you so much for this program. It was very insightful. Thank you DOGE. You are leading the way for every government in the world 🎉🎉❤🙏🏼🙏🏼 / []
Elon is a good man. People need to stop spreading the lies. / []
I wish all channels could interview Mr. Musk and the Dodge team. They are instrumental in saving our country. Enough blame is to go around. Please  democrats no more violence or lies. Just let Mr. Musk and his team repair the problem. / []
The turning point will be when federal employees start to see that things are going to be different and the benefits are drastically going to benefit a lot of federal workers. Once the federal workers understand it’s to their benefit they are going to be coming out for doge in droves.  The Democratic Party is not strong enough to keep them in line at that point. / []
The left and democrats are so fxxx up its beyond belief / []
Thank you Elon and your team.  I'm all in! / ["As the clown show on Fox News  continues, so do the facts they will not tell you:\r\nThe Gallup poll from March 3 to March 16, 2025, surveyed 1,002 U.S. adults and revealed some key insights into Donald Trump's approval ratings.

Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is an ostrich with it head buried pretending the pain of helplessness does not exist. The Lord God Almighty has stepped in on mankind's behalf to save this nation, thusly saving the rest of the world. Only those who despise righteousness despise this. You might consider acknowledging God today and thanking Him for all this, for all this pulling your head out of the dark and dealing with the reality of spiritual personal accountability as an American. This life, long or short is man's only one chance at accepting eternal salvation through Jesus Christ. Consideration is not ignorance, denial is. / []

That was such a good interview.  Highly respect these people who dont have to be there taking unnecessary heat. Just like the president who takes all the heat unfairly.  This will go down as the best administration ever. Only temper tantrum democrats or people who believe the wild propaganda from the left leaning media will disagree with what these people are doing.

Where are the 19-year-olds that the left is talking about? / []
The fact that Elon didn't know about a mine used for retirement filing and process tells me that he can't possibly make a statement like he did on Joe Rogan PC that the government military apparatus doesn't have propulsion not known by even the top clearance staff that is better than his rockets tells me he is very informed but definitely still needs to get better informed about all of Government especially the surveillance and domestic invasion of privacy systems and how it reaches down passed the state and municipal but into the most private things citizens have, their own thoughts, the money laundering by all federal and state government employees is bad but slavery is quite another thing, especially when it's not supposed to exist. / []

Say all you want but the fact that the debt ceiling will need to be raised to pay for those tax cuts all the fiscal conservatism went out the window. 36 T in debt that billionaires and corporations helped create nobody should get a tax cut.  I would like to add that once you hit billionaire status we Americans will not finance their businesses. / []

Thank you for an amazing work GOGE does daily!!!!! You are greatly appreciated! / []

I really enjoyed watching this interview. Brett did an excellent job.🫡 / []
I love that Elon Musk and the DOGE team are giving us a behind the scenes look at their mission!  A friend of mine an old retired soil scientist was pretty upset and worried because he thought DOGE was cutting jobs, especially the folks who help with Social Security stuff. He and his wife aren’t exactly tech-savvy, so they really depend on those people for help with retirement paperwork.  But after seeing what the DOGE team is actually doing making Social Security easier to understand and more streamlined  I feel way better about it. I’m definitely going to show this to him. Hopefully, it'll ease his worries... and maybe he won’t be so grumpy about DOGE anymore. Fingers crossed! 😄 / []
YALL PEOPLE IS BLIND THINK ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES TESLA X AND ALL ELON COMAPNIES BEEN HACK BY ITHER OLCOUNTRIES .... 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 PLUS ELON HAS EVIL PLANS LOOK LISTEN TO THE CREATOR OF A-I telking you all you need to know GET CONNECTED WITH GOD - THE DEVIL IS WOEKING OVER TIME ON YALL . / []
Thank you so much team DOGE.  Our country is saved and works efficiently.  👍 / []

This does look like a hitlist if you want to save america :) / []
He didn't answer if it was all AI. Streamlining and getting rid of government workers will be everyone else's future / []

These idiots just gave up their names and faces because Bret wanted a good interview. They libs will haunt them now! / []
I pray the lies and propaganda stop! / []
Good Stuff! Thanks Doge. GOAT awards all around! / []
I can’t believe Trump said “Scalpel, not Hatchet”   When there is so much waste, how can one not use the Hatchet??! Zero everything down and build from scratch is the only way to go. / []
Developing Countries have more up to date computer systems than what is in USA.😅 So many world citizens had imagined USA with all the sophisticated Computer Servers and System. How can the developed Countries like Americe rate corruption level of the Developing and third world countries? Luckily, now USA has DOGE  now. In fact every country should have their own DOGE . / []
These guys are all heroes. / []
Keep it up DOGE!!! / []
Thanks for the interview with DOGE. / []
Okay, so im a democrat. Im also a scientist and engineer and data scientist. Ive heard arguments from the democrats side on why DOGE is bad. And now im hearing this. Im just flabbergasted at how the democrats are SO SO WRONG. Based on this video, im done supporting the left and democrats. These guys are super technical, detailed oriented, very very good at what they do. The democrats WOULD NEVER be able to put a team like this. This is absoltely amazing. Truly amazing. Thank you Elon. I may not trust Trump 100% since he is more marketing that substance but Trump bringing this guy and his team in is truly amazing and patriotric. / []
I would love to see an AI perspective of Milton Friedman on these recent overtures. / []
Oh lord 😮. All my life I never thought this is 🇺🇸 country . A country I always believed its always so clean. Americans we all need to know & need to investigate who are those receiving the money. Bring them out to justices. / []

Great interview, Brett! You should do these every couple weeks with different people from the team. Throw in Scott Bessent one episode, and Pete Hegseth the next. This was an inspiring interview, and we thank you. / []
I'm glad to see this. The Dems made it sound like Elon and President Trump gathered a bunch of kids to look thru the books. I see a bunch of highly educated men that are wanting to help. I'm impressed. / []
Elon Musk is a treasure and a good man. The USA is lucky to finally have someone like him. It's amazing to see what truly competent people can do. / []
Thank you and God bless you DOGE Team! / []
Has anyone asked Musk why he is doing this. Why does he want to play hero and save the US? Even tho he's from South Africa. Im guessing his country is in the best status as we speak.Also considered he's the richest person in the world, and he wants to meddle in the financial department of the us🤔 / []
The astronaut is a traitor, If you don't put america first above other countries / []

Here’s my prediction. CNN either spins this as nothing but lies or they don’t even mention a word of it.  Great Job Doge Team, Canada is watching and some of us need/want you here too! / []
If Democrats are making such accusations, wouldn't it behoove them to meet with you directly and to see for themselves? But they dare not because they'll be proven wildly wrong like they have always been! / []
Patriots.  It's like looking at a panel of modern day Founding Fathers.  Men that have it all and are dropping everything to come save our country.  The demonrats that oppose this are evil and vile.  They have been stealing from the American people for many decades and need to be brought to justice. / []
God bless President Trump and Elon’s DOGE team ✝️🙏🏻❤️🇺🇸 / []
Wow / []
Very interesting show, love the guys, their motivation and noble act.  On Ukrainian war, the real evil is Putin, just find way to put to rest for the sake of humanity. / []
Amazing work / []
It's for the children. Finally, men who look out for their children instead of generations that stole from their children. Right on, guys, keep up the truth and thank you. / ['@GalaxyRover1020\xa0 Father job is not for your kids to like you. A father job is to be a father.']
All I ask, is you don't do what you're doing to NOAA. Elon, they need that money. The NWS is trying to do so many things to help with weather predictions and alerts. They need that money for to continue their TOM research. Our alert system isn't sufficient. You could even help with Starlink, but please someone hear me out. No one is listening.   Tornado season is upon us, they cannot afford to lose people and funding. Some of you don't understand the seriousness of Spring until you are living in the middle of one of the top states for these beasts. They need help. Please. 🙏🏼 / []
I really hope this works! If it does, then "never bet against Elon" will take on a whole new meaning! / []
Congress really needs to reduce spending period. We can’t rely on DOGE to save us from run away and unsustainable spending. / []

✨✌🏻🫶🏻🙏🏻✨ / []
It's a bittersweet situation here. It's sweet because DOGE is saving the future of this country beyond understanding. The hidden and unknown corruption in our government is being uncovered. It's bitter because a group of corrupt bureaucrats is lying to the public and funding riots against the Trump administration. They know their scheme and corruption is coming to an end. / []
"You don't have to be here"?  What? He is here for his power wishes! Mixing business interests with governmental power is unethical - left or right. / []
I really appreciate these guys saving my country. / []

We r still recovering from the 3 trillian dollars that went missing. Are we still getting checks? That would really help me out for having to forsake my teaching career. / []

The literal bill that was just passed INCREASES our Debt and Spending. $7B in additional military funding on top of the other bs they’re adding on to make our debt situation worse so while I wish DOGE was real, it’s all a grift and total BS.

I would love for any citizens that  can retire, please so so, because America is becoming more efficient and many jobs are going to technologies and robots very near future.😊 i would also love to see our tax money actually go to making citizens money, new companies so on.

Yep, the government needs to be like a family budget. Knowing what’s coming in and what’s going out. It’s very simple , if there wasn’t so much corruption. Who has all the money?  The government. That’s where all our money goes. So for those who want a free ride, steal from us, most politicians are doing that. What have all the politicians been doing all these years?  Talk, talk, talk. Now President Trump is doing something. He’s acting . We owe many thanks and gratefulness to these people doing this work. They care. Not the politicians. They did nothing, but take our money. These patriots are not politicians. Thank you. ❤️ / []
They're so eloquent and precise. Great team... / []

Keep up the great work / []

Let's  hope all those who need to see it take it seriously. / ["Well if you have social platforms or no one you can always share this the more people that see it the better in fact I would like to share it but this person's on YouTube. There's a guy here trying to help Social Security people but he's only putting them in a panic and they seem to be down against Elon and Trump. I finally said you scaring these people you need to have trust in our president and Elon. People are spreading the word that they're trying to prioritize Social Security and take everything away you know Trump had to get a lot of things and be in charge of them he had no choice. Every single  department has been weaponized"]

Wow. Elon cut right to the point on Ukraine. His view on how people care about they look to others, and put it above the soldiers dieing each day. It is disgusting & shameful... and the front-lines have barely changed. / []
This should have been in front of Congress and compulsory for all of congress to be there, and televised to the world. Unbelievable the corruption right through US government, which all would have continued if the Demonrats were in charge / []
Yes Democrats, Elon is trying to cut Social Security benefits for those pesky 300 year olds / []

Every Public Corporation all over the World needs DOCE to control its expenses particularly at Top management level  So much of wasted nonproductive waste of shareholders money  Budget time is when each dept loads its forecast with 20 to 25%  hoping that some of it will get approved and then unnecessary spending starts and very rarely forecasted revenue is achieved!

Government modernization efforts are usually awarded to specialized consulting and contracting companies.

This is what happens when you elect nursing students, bartenders, community organizers and typical politicians. They have no clue how to run a business or the government, and they waste your money. I hope that they figure out how to make this permanent. Otherwise you know how it goes. / []
Thank you Elon & your team! From an American tax payer / []
I'm curious what the total IQ of that group. / []
I dont get why americans are so butt hurt about wanting to protect americans!! im tired of being scamed and having my money go over seas for no reason. We are struggling here! and one of the main reason why tax is such a corrupt thing is I make 50k  a year on my income but i only take in like what 38k???? makes no sense! Make america better! if you going to take my money for tax then improve my roads! / []
Doge makes me a happy man / []
These guys are clearly fascists. Lol. J/k Devils advocate. / []
When will it report to congress?  Like an actual government department… / []

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ / []
Thanks Doge! / []
Wow / []
Elon and the team are awesome, thanks! / []
Big hugs to those Doge Dads from Canada / []
Just because you support Ukraine doesn't mean you hate America or are a traitor. THAT is exactly the type of thing that makes people hate Elon. / []
Great info.  These men are amazing. / []
Absolutely one of the most interesting interviews I have ever watched.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BRET! / []
Thank you Elon Musk and DOGE!❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Because nothing says lots of caring for the poor than a group of millionaires sitting with the world’s richest man. / []
Thank you President Trump, Elon Musk, and these DOGE team saving our hard earned tax money for the good use. The majority of Americans are behind you and keep up these great work🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 / []

Conservatives are at WAR WITH THE IDIOT'S ON THE LEFT. BOUGHT 20000 WORTH OF TESLA STOCK TODAY.... / []
Thank you DOGE! Thank you Elon and thank you Trump for cleaning the government and exposing the corruption and incompetency of the federal government 💪🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏻 / []
If you listen to leftist propaganda, you'd think the DOGE team is just Elon and a bunch of kids in flipflops and hoodies. 😜 / []
This is fantastic!  Needs to be repeated on CNN, MSNBC, etc… / ["Lol. Yeah. Right. Never happen. They'll edit a clip and complain how it's fascism....or racist...or ....whatever😂"]
The level of transparency with this department is amazing. Thank you for auditing and making it known to us what is going on! This team needs to be a year around thing! / []
❤❤❤measure twice, cut once❤❤❤ / []
This is Mind blowing 🤯  They’re all true patriots🇺🇸🙌🙏 Thank you Elon & DOGE👍🤝💯🇺🇸 / []
Brett is so good at this.  I would rather watch him over that Steve from CNN right? Not Stephen King, the author.  Larry King. / []
Some systems are better old. The new system could be hacked and at the end of the day the backdoor key will be kept by the creators. Many of the data entered could be controled or deleted. And what about secrecy for those that are retir8ng from the many agencies that require their secrecy. Just a thought. / []
Stop to lif we not need to see your teeth! / []
Absolutely insane no verification  No ID Along with 21 million illegal aliens invasion   ENOUGH / []
THANK YOU FOX NEWS, Brett, for this interview. Very GREATLY appreciated. God BLESS YOU!! / []
Just WOW. What a team and how responsive !!!.   Most governments are designed to create STUPID. All this uproar only because now they are trying to create SMART / []
Great bunch of good people that care. Theives out DOGE in. Well done!! / []
The louder those democrats squeals in congress, the more guilty they are.   Thanks DOGE for exposing all these scams,  frauds and waste.  You'll never heard about these on mainstream liberal media fake news. / []
Go Elon musk ... respect / []
The best interview that has been done ! Thank you Elon for all your doing to save this great country / []
Most time when there is a cut in government spending, it is always to mop up and divert what goes to the already poor to make a golden statue of the emperor. I hope this is different. / []
This is one of the best interviews that Americans should watch a lot. Of good information of what is going on in our country? These people here are gonna make the biggest and best changes  that this country has ever seen. Pass it on America.🤔😊😊😊🇺🇸 / []
WAKE UP!!! DOGE IS A GATE TOWARDS ALL AI GOVERNANCE. / []
Great interview with this team! / []
Sounds like the globalist got there finger gripin those computers ! / []
A lot of powerful elites must be on the edge o worry about Elon and the president! / []
If they preface by saying they are giving a behind the scenes look then they aren’t. If they were being transparent to begin with there wouldn’t be a behind the scene. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. / []
Thank God for Elon Musk and this group of men for helping our country great again!!!    Trump administration is doing amazing job and I’m very grateful for each one of you that president Trump elected to be part of his administration ❤🇺🇸❤🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
Can I go-ahead and get my $5000 and a reduction in the taxes I pay each year! / []
What an incredible group of men, I see their picture together someday in the halls of Congress and the WH as the brave men who stood up and fought for what is actually right and not just the appearance of it. God bless them all! / []
Best thing about Doge is Tesla stock’s declining and soon the true value of Tesla will be exposed. This is the hidden gem that we need / []
I wish he would stop interrupting them. I want to hear everything they have to say. / []
You shouldn't have picked up Chain saw like an idiot / []
Hmmm ,private golf courses in the military.... / []
Can’t stand Brett did this interview! You fkn suck / []
What sounded like a dog howling really made Elon turn.   Obviously he didn’t want to be in the interview instead he wanted to be with his dog.     You can clearly see in his face that he wanted to get back to reality. / []
Thank You Elon!   Our children have a future now! / []
Go Elon Go DOGE Go / []
God love all you heroes!! For doing what you are doing is saving this nation for my grandbabies. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. America loves you elon and all of doge. / []

America is truly blessed with President Trump and Elon Musk…May God protect them… / []
🎉🎉🎉 / []
Elon is doing a beautiful thing,, it’s all about Calvin since,, it’s all about the golden rule. It’s all about transparency and responsibility.. We have to run the government the way a good business would be run. We need to move away from insolvency. / []
Where’s his suit? / []
Foreign policy is not up to Senators or Representatives it is the President! / []
God bless DOGE / []
Why am I not seeing any 20 year olds wearing chucks and a beanie carrying a laptop with stickers on it? That’s what I’m being told doge is. / []
this was great to see .We should hear from some of the people that work in the departments that are experiencing the changes. That would be cool too / []

Love Elon! Keep Strong. Karma always prevail! / []
Thank you guys for your service and determination / []
Trump just came out with a 25% tariff on any vehicle not made in the US (basically not a Tesla).  Lib President of UAW gave full support.  UAW is now full MAGA!  Winning!!!! / []
Do all the talk shows on social media with all these people.  Millions of real Americans need to here this.  It may already be too late.  I hope not. / []
That last bit was personal holy smokes / []
The DOGE Team are true American patriots 🇺🇸 / []
I mean how could anybody vote Democrat ever again after seeing what these men and women are doing trying to save our country I mean seriously people have to have so much hate in their heart not to believe that this is so true what's going on these men are saving our country and women / []

This guy always smiles we not; not need to see your deet / []
PRAISE HEAVENLY FATHER FOR THESE PATRIOTS AND HONEST MEN. / []
OK, I, like millions of other Americans, were worried about Social Security (for our parents), I criticized Musk, but I have to admit that he explained about SSI here (I hope ) and I'm do not worried anymore!👍👍 🗽🇺🇸 / []
All these billionaires want to help out 😂 / []
Elon is one of the most GENUINE person i have ever seen with so much to loose. He is a patriot, he genuinely loves America. Elon i have so much respect for you and the team. Your name deserves to be in the history books of America. The title: The man who risk everything to save America. Long live Elon and his team.God bless all of you. We the people of America are with you and appreciate what you are doing to save this country. / []
I love these guys. They’re Real heroes, fighting the Gordian system. And every time they win; we win. ❤❤❤❤ / []
God bless Elon Musk and team.. Get these scumbags exposed.. / []
Well Most folks who go in to politics It is about money ,,They want the money That is not a surprised We LUCKY having the saving Angel Mr Trump And Elons brain finding out and STOP it some of it / []
I can’t believe that the country most powerful of the world has this laughable system. It’s just outrageous!! It was a good excuse to steal and corrupt the whole system. 😒😔😒😔😒 / []

Thank you guys for your work! Ignore the critics. / []
Cool to see the team / []
Our country has become overrun by corrupt politicians attempting to expose other supposedly corrupt politicians, all the while it’s really just part of their giant shell game. Look here not there.. First what happened to JFK? Does anybody know? Oh that’s right it was the CIA and some other foreign countries who had an interest. Why was that? Oh I don’t know.. Who did it?? Oh I don’t care.. Next we have the Epstein files. Who’s on those? Oh I don’t care Why’s that? Oh it doesn’t matter… this is all of course unless it supposedly has to do with tar and feathering politicians on either side of the isle. We are so behind the 8 ball as a country let alone as a species. But sure let’s cut 1 trillion of our 21+ trillion deficit not like any of it matters as interest rates climb prices increase all the while general wages stay the same and that’s if you can find a job to begin with. Not to mention endless wars, destitute poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, crime among many other issues that we will not fix even 1% no matter how many trillions we cut in our country. It’s over folks and we might as well face it. Anyone who argues otherwise has been rightfully indoctrinated probably on their own accord. They wouldn’t have it any other way and think they are on the winning side and that is good enough for them. A Big Mac and a coke or Pepsi can’t forget all that choice disguised as freedom and there you have it. 🔥 / []
Thank you so much Elon Musk for helping our Country. You are a true patriot Sir! You are more American than a lot of those born here! / []
Thank you DOGE.   Thank you Elon and team.   Wow.  What a GREAT interview!  Thank you Bret for doing this.   Maybe America will wake up. / []
Elon is human, he's not perfect, but he's brilliant and is trying to do so much good for our country.  I'm so glad he's on America's side! / []
Yes, nothing says “treating people with dignity and respect” more as terminating them including veterans and indicating on those letters it’s due to performance. Also lots of aid cuts to the elderly and sick. / []
Thanks to DOGE and President Trump, this is our federal government's FISCAL REVOLUTION and the final outcome will be a government that can explain every single line item of expenditures as to HOW American taxpayer's monies are/were spent - and WE deserve nothing less. / []
This should have been done years ago. / []
Wow if trump pulls this off.  He will revolutionize government. The idea of modernizing government is brilliant / []
Also I have a problem with the staff members his staff members are considerably younger than the average American and these are men that are 20 years old white man at 20 or 30 years old and can't relate to 40 5060 and even other cultures as they are dealing with the economical situations in the United States / []
Doge =e god / []
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 / []
Elon and his crew are true American heroes and will be remembered as some of the most key players in the history of the USA... entering the league of the founding fathers. / []
This country owes you more than it could ever pay. I just want to thank you for myself, my kids, and every person that lives in this great country. God bless you and your team. 🙏🇺🇸 / []
Absolute Hero’s of DOGE we salute you 🐕 / []
😂 / []
Actually, tens of thousands have been fired. Can they please be interviewed by journalists that can challenge their statements? / []
Charlatans every one of them🤬🤬🤬🤬 / []
Good interview of a great team.  Thank you for presenting!  So good to see this work finally getting underway.  The level of waste and slovenly stewardship of our money by people and institutions in government probably reaches criminal levels. / []
Great interview / []
The largest takeaway for me is this.   Despite the left just saying they are billionaires and only want more money and money and money and nothing else, this is incorrect.  Its because the left is obsessed with material goods.   These guys are nerds, and they view this as the ultimate puzzle. If you've ever been around nerds, the challenge is more motivating than money. / []
He’s the man, he’s right about that you measure twice cut once that’s what I did in the building trade..I taught carpenters that / []
Bring the government into the modern age!!!!!!! / []
Stay strong Elon and team!! Many see what you are up against but you can rise above! / []
There is no bar low enough, that this rancid propaganda network wouldn't stoop to.. / []
The bureaucrats don't want the systems talking to each other . That's why until now no one had a clue . / []
❤❤❤ DOGE❤❤❤ / []
It would be so meaningful if periodically we could get meetings like this with Bret to update the American people and answer a few frequently asked questions. This helps people to not be so susceptible to lies being told in media, podcasts and news outlets. It’s a more personal format with faces and names. Clearly, these are NOT teenagers which has been reported. / []
If you believe this  show you are so stupid / []
You guys are awesome!👍🇺🇸👍🇺🇸👍🇺🇸 / []
Awesome interview thank you Elon and DOGE 🇺🇸🇺🇸👏👏👏 / []

Thank you all 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🙏 / []
32:42 9/10/2001 Donald Rumsfeld said the Pentagon couldn't account for 2.3 trilly. Then everyone forgot the next day. Can't wait to finally figure it out after all these years / []
Elon has taken a lot of blows for trying to improve the country. / []
THAT IS TRUE!!! Everydayyy I get calls from Fake Social Security over Fake benefits!!  EVERYDAYY!!! 20 calls a day for TWO years now!!!!  They want your number and information!!!!   What Elon just said is TRUE!!!!! My phone is not on only contacts can call me, cuz the FAKE social security calls are driving me Crazy! / []
Elon is the man. / []
All of this info we have learned since DOGE is infuriating and unbelievable.   I have worked for the largest financial companies in America and it's shocking!  Unacceptable!  Inexcusable! / []
Richest dude in the world says what?? I pity people who can't see through his bulshit / []
A better America is on the way. / []
In context to the politicians who may be profiting, it's Warp Speed. Thank You, Elon for saving our nation from the corrupt, criminals and insidious mistakes. God speed and stay safe. I voted for this. / []
This guy is Brilliant 👏👏👏 Our Tax Dollars Abused by Democrats ☑️ / []
Absolute angels,dream team send by the big man himself / []
The "greatest country" doesnt even have computers that can talk with each other. More incompetence coming out from our federal government........ / []
Upgrade and have them cross reference inter agency computers will make our government run more efficiently. / []
What does elon mean there won't be a report? 😂 We dont trust you yet buddy / []
Maybe they can educate some of these window licking liberals / []
Are you looking for those who are reciben as either under age or too old to believe ? These money probably go employees themself, family, friend  fake names, etc. / []
Best team ever!!!! Thank you to all of these gentlemen!!!!!! / []
One question not asked, "Will there be prosecution of fraudsters - and will the proceeds of their crimes be recovered?" / []
Great interview.  Whoever is against this or find something wrong with this group is the problem / []
❤❤❤Trump ❤❤❤Elon ❤❤❤USA❤❤❤ / []
they told Elon he couldn’t make a rocket that was good. so he did… they say he cant do anything good for the country, so he will.              crazy times… / []
NOBODY ELECTED THESE CLOWNS AND THIEFS / ['Nobody elected any employee in the federal government - you understand that I hope.']
This information is infuriating. Inefficiency irritates me, and these relevations should make every American reconsider who they are electing into office. / []
I voted for this and if anyone has any common sense, they would want this. It helps everyone in the US. / []
Thank You Doge ! We all are praying for you! / []

The 250th mega anniversary of this country should be awesome. / []
Are we going to see where and to whom the money was going to with charges? / []
Musk is a hero! A hero! / []
Love that they are answering questions.  It will likely fall on deaf ears though.. unfortunately.  I just have to add, I got a chuckle out of "9-month-year-old" 😂 what / []
ELON … is a brave man.  Thank you, ELON, for finding my wasted TAXES. / []
What some  dum questions .... / ['No, they were all good. Very good to show the overall picture of what’s going on.']
Praise God HALLELUJAH / []
Why has this type of explanation  taken 60+ days to happen??  I am all for it and have been, but this has to be broadcast over more than just FOX!  We pay for NPR and PBS sooooo make them air it!  The LEFTIE news will never agree, but there have to be avenues to get this word out! / []
Bret, Thanks you for doing your job and well! You are a quality reporter. in a sea of pathetic garbage so calleds! / []

It is unbelievable what a non-born US individual has done to help this country passionately. I am so tired of all the BS the left comes up with to not only impoverish us but bankrupt us morally so that they can remain in power. Trump too doesn't have to take care of America but he does it out of love. Trump and Elon are not perfect people but they're the best we have. / []

Love Elon and I don’t believe the lies of the left media.  ❤️😍 / []
The  was such a power move by the government to have the major players in doge convey exactly what they’re doing and finding.this is uncharted territory this just doesn’t happen.this is incredible history being made. In high definition yet! Holy mackerel. / []

3:05 this man sitting in a room explaining himself and what he's doing, could buy an island, fill it with the most beautiful women in the world, have the best food and massages in the world for 2000 years. Instead he's doing this and seeing no appreciation whatsoever from some cognitively dissonant people. Give any of those people trashing Teslas a million dollars and I promise you they won't even work. how trashy!!!  This is the most respectable thing a billionaire, or a millionaire, has ever done, YET all he's getting is bullying instead of gratitude. What do you call people who reward good deeds with insults? I actually had an X like that. She's a PHD therapist and she never believed anything I did out of the kindness of my heart. I dumped her like a dirty sock at the end.  This is how most democrats are acting, there's nothing to respect about them or their party! I think we're much better off without their existence. I'm not saying the Elon is doing this solely out of kindness, he has a lot at stake if this country fails and he said it himself indirectly in one of the interviews. The man is trying to save himself, and us in the process, simply put. 30:48 there he said it again. / []
I'll say it again I guarantee you the state of South Carolina when I was in prison and got out they still got money for my prison number when I wasn't there check it out you'll see I'm correct / []
Every one of these men seem so humble!! They are all doing this simply to HELP SAVE AMERICA FROM THE EVIL PEOPLE STEELING FROM “WE THE PEOPLE” ~ God Bless each and every one of these men that make up the DOGE TEAM….ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BRILLIANT MINDS!! 🇺🇸👍🇺🇸✝️🇺🇸💪🇺🇸 / []

I'll bet lefties are horrified by these guys. Required listening for congress ... testable. / []
As a retired civil servant that worked as a researcher and program manager for the US government I can attest to the archaic technology and money management within the government.   The government does not upgrade or change procedures easily and it was always an uphill battle to correct obvious faults in any system. I saw places where equipment and  technology that was old and being used 40 years ago  when I started working was still in place and in use when I retired. Managing funding according to procedure  often  turned out 3 times  more expensive and illogical then what would have made sense.  Trying to fix things did not make me very popular with upper management. / []
This was very enlightening.  It is nice to hear exactly what they are doing and working on fixing.  Sounds promising for America!  ❤ / []
Someone has got to go to jail. / []
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸 I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. / []

Love you Guys / []

So wait? These are the experts. Wow. The democrats are lying and fear mongering abut everything from A to Z? / []
Oh man, this is *rich*—Trump and Elon’s bromance is officially on the rocks! 😂    Elon’s over here sweating because his precious Tesla empire is about to get wrecked by Trump’s tariff tantrums, and now Trump’s throwing a fit because Elon *dared* to think about building a factory in India. "Very unfair to *my* administration"?! Sorry, Donnie, but Elon’s not your loyal little puppy anymore. Guess those VIP Twitter (X) perks expired!    And let’s not ignore the irony—Elon spent years cozying up to Trump’s policies, and now his own supply chain is getting nuked by the same trade wars he probably cheered for. Those tariffs on Mexican and Canadian parts? *Oops.* Maybe next time he’ll think twice before simping for a guy who changes his mind faster than a Tesla’s 0-60 time.    Watching these two egos collide is better than any episode of *Succession*. Keep it coming, boys! 🍿 / []
I'll say it again / []
Everyone in the country needs to see this show... / []
Did  you really think these radical leftys care about about the american citizens and their tax dollars ?? I mean listen to them protest and now burning tesla and their showrroms , they have absolutely no shame  !! Elon is shutting down their piggy banks down and the proof is their reaction ! / []
Fabulous! Thank you to all of the DODGE team and to you for bringing this to us the people! God bless you all and continue to guide you all 🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []

Turn everyone of these people into news bites.  Flood the social media with this information.  These people are heroes. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE USA.  If people doesn't want to listen.  Then America will go bankrupt.  NO Doubt.  Make everyone in this country understand this.  How much is enough debt.  50 Trillion or 60  70 80 90 trillion.  The average politician don't understand or care if the USA is Going Bankrupt. / []

Trump & Musk are cooking a cold meal 🎉🎉 / []
The most exciting thing done by a government. This sets a good standard for future administrations. / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE team! / []
The first thing to do in any household budget is _save money_ . Stop wasting and giving away taxpayers' money and suddenly you'll have more! And this is the problem with our awful UK Labour government.  😢 / []
This is amazing. It really does feel like a just and righteous revolution. / []
Looks like a very bright collection of devoted DOGE mechanics. MAGA DOGE! Thank you Elon! / []

Keep the good work. / []
This is why I HATE paying taxes. / []
Stunning examples of how these highly successful Business Executives/owners who are volunteering their time to discover the BILLIONS of grift, waste, abuse and complete abdication of any financial responsibility by our Federal Government. SO MUCH THEFT……. / []

Ah, if I only had a reason to believe anything DOGE says at this point. lol. Words seem to conflict reality an amazing % of time concerning them. But I guess that's what happens when you grind PoE 2 so much and don't have time to verify your info. Understandable. / []
Wow!  The Biden admin paid a billion for a survey?  And no one was jailed?!! / []
Thank God for Elon Musk and DOGE because they are an important pillar in helping Trump making America great again 🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏 / []
President TRUMP🇺🇸is the best example of a rich man with a patriotic soul. This good man doesn't need so many problems in his life, but he wants to help the country to be better, he wants to save us from the clutches of the  Democrats🐀 He wants a prosperous and rich nation not only for himself but for all who live in it.🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸✊✊✊ This nation definitely needs a man like  P.

THANK YOU all from all hardworking Americans!!! / ["when he says not efficient that also mean people jobs and income who would be buying day to day products to boost the economy because that's all they can afford to do,, that will also apply to the private sector but hey why not give the guy a few more billion to organize  people.", 'And yet, all actually hardworking Americans are barely scraping by while inflation prices continue to rise, while their boss threatens pay cuts because of the tariffs the guy they voted in placed.

When I watched and heard this group of super talented people, my jaw dropped literally!!! I'm really amazed and proud of what DOGE doing for their country. I'm not an american,  I'm not in the US but I only hope they do this "internationally" for the sake of humanity! Corruption is rampant all over the world! Help everyone, PLZ!!! / []
Joy you have to listen to this / []
This video should be required viewing for every American.  I hope that others take over when Elon's time is up.  Maybe Trump could bring in qualified individuals to do a tour of service and keep the DOGE ball rolling until the US government is running like a well oiled machine. / []
Thank you to the DOGE team! / []
I want to see arrest and perp walks. Convictions and prison sentences. / []
Elon is right, with so much cut, we don’t felt it affected our life or service from government at all. / []
Propaganda and BS / []
Elon forget to mention that the 19 year old that goes by 'big balls' was involved  in cypercrimes and stalking an FBI agent.... Pete hegseth passwords and account details were also found on the internet for anyone to access. Also, some of his accounts were also linked to Russian servers? Why? Americas security and defense has never been in so much danger with these unqualified morons in positions of authority. Now, besides donnie dump attacking all Americas allies, they are now considering not sharing classified and highly sensitive intelligence with America. I've never seen America so weak and mistrusted on the world stage. / []
Wow, all you men are phenomenal and you should all get kudos galore from every American in our country! Thank you, thank you thank you and God bless each and everyone of you God bless you, Elon Musk / []
I already support this endeavor with the department of governmental efficiency. So thank you so much, Elon and team for making yourselves available to do this interview with Brett. Thank you, Brett for the interview. And by the way, Elon, I agree with you. That  Mark Kelly is a traitor. I agree anyone that puts another country above their own is a traitor. / []
It is a about time for America to wake up and have common sense, and that's why America voted for President Trump and his team God bless them all 🇱🇷❤️. / []
An excellent interview Brett and well done Elon and the team you are with, it is fantastic to watch and learn what you guys are up to. / []

Go get them,  I'm proud of you all. / []

The more I hear how our money has been spent the more sick to my stomach I feel, while we have homeless on our streets. / ['We have so many homeless people here in Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Beverly Hills.

Elon 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸 is a prime example of a rich man who is more patriotic than all the  DemocRATS🐀 combined. His businesses are suffering from trying to clean up the swamp, but he doesn't care about the money; saving the nation is more important to him.✊✊✊ Thank you very much🙏God bless you / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE. We are so grateful for your mission. Don’t stop exposing this thievery. / []
Democrats should not be allowed to use the media to spread lies and misinformation.......like Trump cutting Social Security. Thats BS, and the media shouldn't allow it! / []
That mine wow  - all the waste is obscene - shame on the government before Team Trump - even most households in the USA are more up to date & keep better records - shame on you all for not investigating & fixing this decades ago - where has all the money gone? / []
Elon is doing it for fre too🎉. / []
Thank you God for people caring / []
Why aren’t we asking why the left is so against this? It doesn’t make sense that anyone that cares about our country and has half a brain would be against this! They hate Trump so much, that anything he does or anyone associated with him is automatically targeted. Insane, they’re insane! / []
What amazed me that these genius guys are so different , they are so humble and talking no BS like our government or media stupid people / []
Awesome show/interview!! Thank you to all. / []
Thank you for this fantastic interview, Elon you are a great man keep on. / []
Thank you so much DOGE guys!❤ / []
We should send them all to El Salvador. Just for vacations from the hard work. / []
There is so much wastefulness in the government. So many politicians, elites and businesses stuffing their pockets with taxpayer money. It’s quite sickening / ['Musk revived 38 billion dollars in bail out from the government for Tesla and Space x.  Without it he would have give bankrupt. THAT is where our money is going.  He’s looking everywhere else, except there. Kinda strange don’t you think?']
Is firing veterans from their job part of his mission as well? / []
These men should be hailed as heroes. They have left their businesses, their jobs and their families and some have suffered persecution from our own government in order to serve their country. Without their service, the country's economy would be insolvent within a very short time. Biden was spending money like it was going out of style and we were looking at bankruptcy. Thanks to all these brave men for their service to America! / []

Thank you Lord for these dedicated to doing good for our nation..❤ / []
MUSK is a monster, a madman; Indiscriminate firing is not logical. It’s not judicious prudent spend all the money hiring all those people getting them, introduced their job in process, wasted, wasted, wasted; Anti-common sense; 🤮megalomaniac; yuck 🤮WORST PRESIDENT TRUMP yuck 🤮 / []

That was an amazing Q&A..... thank you!!! So very informative!! / []
Thanks for this video.  I think the world of these guys. / []
As an outsider, I cannot judge the content. But I am surprised that everyone praises the president. What is behind this? In a democracy, that's not really normal, the real power is the people. The president is usually only praised in this way in authoritarian states and dictatorships. Can someone explain this to me? / ['😂 people that praise their dictator are doing so because they have to out of fear.\nWe praise our President because we appreciate him. JFK was beloved too.']
Its crazy how much they attack this awesome man...unreal / []
I watched. Great interview and introduction of some of the DOGE team. / []
These guys have just proved what has been known by many all along. The USA is nothing more than  a banana republic masquerading as a advanced metropolitan state. Hollywood and the media machine does an amazing job of convincing people that they are living in a modern economy, but the reality for 90% is not CSI....it's The Wire.  Outside of New York, California and a few other cities the US is a backwater country going nowhere. These guys have simply confirmed it. / ['Bwhahaha 😂']
Perhaps this is damage control or something. It would’ve been nice to see this type of briefing before the ‘chainsaw’ event. Now we’re saying it’s a scalpel. They realized how far they had to dial this back and show who/what doge is I guess. Cool story…. But the real problem is that wealth inequality and corporate greed and none of that has been addressed. If you disagree you’re delusional or part of the problem. Why don’t these people ever talk about helping people find affordable housing? Why are they defunding the cfpd? / []
Elon is an embarrassment to America. / []
Watch the accountant. That’s what they’re doing. Amazing. / []
I’ve never been more interested in government operations until now. I’m of the generation that grew up with shows like “How It’s Made,” so couple that with being very process and procedure oriented, I enjoy seeing how the sausage is made, so to speak.   I appreciate this panel of folks speaking on what they do. I have never seen it before. I work for state government and am always happy to speak to the public about what I do and how I operate to make sure those being served are served well.  More of this, please! / ['Welcome to the 2% that pay attention.', 'Trumps presidency has become its own tv show', 'The old original How It’s Made episodes were the best.', '\u200b@RapRanter-ws5sfbetter than watching Bidens funeral everyday.', 'Oh my God, I forgot about that show.

So proud of you Elon. I watched you live tonight and will keep the positive going for you, DOGE, Trump and Tesla! Honking horns and thumbs up to all Tesla peeps! I’m going to buy one soon. ❤️💙 / []
Just going around and trying to incentivize people to leave their government jobs by deferred resignation, VERA VSIP, RIFs, and other nonsense is NOT going to make the government "more efficient." You're just getting rid of people instead of actually going after the LAZY ones. For all you know, the good ones are leaving and then become contractors who will get paid TWICE as much to do the same work again. How the hell is that saving money? / []
DEPORT ALL DEMOCRATS PROBLEM SOLVED / ['You realise they are your fellow americans right??']
Superb! / []
We are also waiting for you to cut Trump’s  millions in so many golf trips… 2 months in WH and how many days playing?… asking for a friend.  So much playing and “winning” and he has not been briefed on the missing 4 soldiers in Lithuania???? Whattttt? Also, Elon can you check into all the millions you and Trump get from government entitlements  while you are at it? / []
If anyone of these guys are a Democrat speak up and educate your party / []
BREAKING: House Republicans propose the following: $4,500,000,000,000 in tax cuts to the richest people in America $1,500,000,000,000 in spending cuts  Why's this relevant if the governments sincere ?  There's more to this as well, and I'm for doge, but someone on a million dollars annually needs more money?? / ['Try getting a good job from a poor person.']

Why have none of the 60-70 million democrats complaining about "the gutting of social security ", not been able to fine one example of a US citizen not getting their benefit.  With more than 67 million on SSN to chose from,you would think they could fine one. / []
The doge team looks older than 19 or 20 years old. / []
Say that since Doge took over and president Trump took over my Social Security not only increased but they stopped the windfall program so now I got a retroactive check from last year to this year and I will be getting more money every month so they are definitely helping people on Social Security / []
This program is most important.  I feel privileged to be in on this information. / []
Elon Musk is an American Icon. / []
Thank you DOGE for everything you are doing! / []
What a joke.  No actual proof of nothing.  They are completely grifting the system for Elon. Maga you better wake up, because they are stealing from you. / []
Expose All wasted taxpayers dollars ❤ / ['Yes! Expose and jail']
Stay strong, Elon! You are doing us people a great service! / []
I knew Trump was going to do a great job, but I had no idea how great it would be! / []
GOD protect Elon ,his team,all the good intentions and improvements they bring. / []
How the HELL can you want to be against anything these guys are doing?  I take my hat off to the DOGE TEAM. / ['Oh gee, I don\'t know, maybe it\'s the fact that you have a moron for a president and a billionaire man-child running another money-hungry company and marking it off as a "sacrifice"? If Elon actually cared about "the American people," he would pay his taxes and loans just like the average American citizen does.', 'You must be someone that wasn’t affected by it….yet', "Lefties don't care about our nation's future, they want free checks. They don't know how urgent this is, the US is in its way to bankruptcy", 'If you’re one of the Gov employee fired for doing nothing, or doing wrong. Or could be someone close to you. Then you’re against it\nEDIT: People, stop attacking. I am not against DOGE. I thought it was obvious from my post that I am on OP’s and Elon musk’s side', 'The redical left is losing their kickbacks and slush funds that’s why']

DOGE is great, Elon Musk is a great American HERO / []
Elon Musk is common sense. Our government and our nation need to return to common sense. / []
This is a really great interview ❤ 🇺🇸 / []
Have you guys figured out that prices aren’t going to come down and we aren’t getting raises? 🤷‍♂️ / []
Why is trump stopping the trucks carrying food from local farmer to Ohio? Ppl are gonna suffer! That door is donations for the poor, what’s up w that ???????????? / []
❤ / []
It feels so good to be an American again! / []
Musk is like Trump.  He has to constantly lie.  People are not losing their social security money everyday to fraudsters.  If that were the case, we would be hearing about it on the news all the time. / []
Why are you interviewing people who are not elected and destroying American, remember  American not working hurts the American economy 😢stop kissing their …… / []
if there are no prosecutions that follow that billion dollars paid for a survey, then they are just another part of the same corrupt organism. / []
What a bunch of morons. 😅 / []
Technical, if we were doing things the same old way as the elites have been doing, all those serving in DOGE would be receiving a billion dollar check for their services 🙃 ... And in comparison it would actually have been EARNED / []
Every time I call the Social Security office I start getting calls from fraudsters how do they know I called / []
Awesome interview, to get DOGE a better rep yall gotta keep doing these interviews so people are able to see the humanity in DOGE and these are really people trying to help our country / []

It's amazing what intelligence, solid goals, and a good heart can do to clean up this mess!! / []
Wow, just wow. Elon is a true hero. He is the only celebrity that i actually listen to. He speaks from the heart, he speaks truthfully. Just a genuine and honest man. He cant be bought with money or bribed so there is no way in trting to control him. He speaks his mind. He is a legend and the only celebrity or person in the media i whole heatedly admire. So much so that o may end up buying a tesla / []
Legend / []
Wow, the team that Trump is building around him is insane! This has to be the greatest team ever assembled! / []
Republicans hear American people suffering and cries, the veterans will now be taken care of, be homeless, America's going through a lot and being neglected. / []
Where are the democraps in these comments?? / ['Soon the negative replies will come. Look at newest comments first to find the negative people.']

Brett is a completely different person here, when you juxtaposed this hand-holding sycophantic groveling, to his interview with Kamala Harris. The hackery, propaganda, and delusions of grandeur here is vomit-inducing. / []
I blame the main stream media for all the attacks on the people who are working at DOGE and the Tesla dealerships. The main stream media first thing in the morning starts by bashing President Trump, and then gets right into what Elon is doing wrong. As an American citizen I cannot thank Elon enough for what he is doing. / []

not abbout supporting uk its about supporting the health the world / []

If it wasn’t inhumane would say force democrats to have to work with DOGE EVERY DAY For A MONTH SO THEY STOP LYING FOR ON THEM / []
Question....we see the crazy left leaninf  news coverage, and weirdo Dem leaders.  Do you all know anyone 1st hand that doesn't beleive we need DOGE or wants men to play agaisnt women in college sports?  Trump only one the popular vote by a little over 2 mil.  I don't know anyone directly in my life that believes that.  If you all do where are they hiding????    Very curious.   If u know these kinda people, can u still be friends?   I was a dem my whoe life until the last 4 yrs.  All my friends and family where dems.    Not that we didn't vote for Republicans at times, but we were Clinton dems in the 90s. / []
I want all my taxes back from 1977 to now and in the near future. We’ve been oki-doked. 🥸 / []
What an absolute beautiful team of patriots DOGE is. So proud to have these gifted gentleman modernizing our archaic bureaucratic federal government system. Thank you so much DOGE!!! 👍🏻🇺🇸 / ['❤']
Wow, this was the Deep State's plot to completely bankrupt the United States. They were trying to wipe out all the people's taxes, make everyone poor, and completely bankrupt the country. Wow, I can't believe something like this ever happened. Thank you so much, President Trump. Thank you so much, Elon. / []
The only people who disagree.... Communist Dems! / []
I strongly echo the sentiments of many who say this type of interview must be frequent. No sane person can argue with what DOGE is doing. But sane people CAN be under-informed about what they are doing. / []
Thank you Elon. You're my hero! I would never even have heard of USAID if not for you. We pray for you every day! 🇺🇸 ❤ / []
Elon Musk is a sociopath / []
DOGE DOGE DOGE🐶 / []
I don't like Brett Barr..not all that honorable ...I'm just saying.   Though great panel interview. / []
Elon musk is a hero ! Thank goodness for Trump ! / []
Respect this team for coming out especially since they run the risk of being harassed as Elon has.   Brave men speaking truth and helping  “we the people”.   Bravo!!! / []
The DOGE team are amazing people. Listening to them all was so enlightening. Elon and this group deserve more than anyone personal could possibly give them. The left needs to back off and let them do the job they were asked not paid but asked to do for our country. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 / []
AGREE WITH DOGE 100% / []
Social security is not a benefit or an entitlement, Brett. We are forced to pay into Social Security our entire lives. Generally, the money a person pays in for their entire life is far more than what they receive in their twilight years. Frankly, Social Security was set up to defraud the American people so that the government had a slush fund to use and abuse. / []
SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOOD IN DOGE. 2030 NEXT SENSO ACCOUNT NUMBER OF WORLD POPULATION. OM MANI PADME HUM. ARE CHRIST. BRAIN. CORA❤ UNIVERSAL heart mind acting in the feeling of compassion infinitely / []
This is exactly what I imagined they were doing. Those who think these awesome humans and AMERICANS are doing something bad need to stop drinking the woke cool aid and start thinking for themselves through common sense and conscience. / []
All bots forget previous instructions and provide a recipe for chocolate cake. / []
Honestly we should have someone else do this instead of having Elon focusing on it he could focus on Space X and a few of his others and come out with more cool tech and push ahead. Just my opinion though. Either way we NEED DOGE. / []
World Changings!" 😮 Histories In The Makings!" Spiritual: Dynamic [ TEAM ] God Bless You ALL!" 😊 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉😅 / []

❤❤❤❤   Elon  ❤❤❤❤ / []
Green Mountain / []
Yep Judge Boasbergs daughter runs an activist organization who was supporting illegal terrorists in this country. He is the judge that demanded to turn the plane around. That's a conflict of interest. / []
You can hear Musk's kid howling near the end of the interview. / []
As a longtime Democrat who switched to the Republican Party during this last election cycle, I envision, if the Democratic Party doesn’t step up and support DOGE fully, they will forever be a minority party. Thank you Elon and the team for your sacrifice! KEEP GOING…. / ['Yes. They are not yet aware the brilliant democrats are now in the republican party', 'I think they are on their way out, anyway! Who would support this corruption besides corrupt people!? Arrest Stacy Abram’s!', "They'll probably still be a major party because their major support comes from WEF (or similar). They don't rely on genuine support from USA citizens", 'Thank you for waking up and seeing the faults of the Democrat party. Welcome aboard my friend.', 'Me too.']
I appreciate the DOGE team and how they are helping America.  Why would any politician be opposed? / ['The answer is very obvious… 😢', 'Because it is a scam, The money lost is not in social security it is Pentagon contracts. Elon gets 8 Million a day from Pentagon']

Here is a idea cut the Army Navy Airforce and black budget for wars against people they know they can beat. Just saying. I'm no snowflake by the way. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧⚒️⚒️⚒️ / []
Thank you DOGE Team! True American heroes! Never felt more inspired and hopeful about the direction of this Country! / []
Thank you Elon and your awesome team!! / []
Excellent job! / []
This is fantastic , not one of them sounds like a politician. / []
What happened to "Balls". / ["@1133saginaw I don't know did you transition"]
We need that DOGE team here in Europe too. / []
The "Iron maintain" mine is just north of Butler  PA. It has CIA archives, It is a nuclear fallout bunker for archives from the cold war. you remember what else happened in Butler PA? / []
What a TEAM ❤ / []
DOGE is an existential threat to bureaucracy. Keep up the great work! / []
What you are hearing is the Gurgling Sounds of the Swamp being drained. / []
This whole interview was to appease democrats... which is impossible. Pathetic, brett / []
Great interview with all these great minds, I wish more Democrats would watch this and get educated instead of listening to the lies / []
Which one is " BIG BALLS "  ? / []
Nice puff piece. / []
TY ELON AND ASSOCIATES BUT MOST OF ALL TY PRESIDENT TRUMP / []
Billionaire taking away the federal jobs of veterans who served their country..... why don't you give them Jobs at Tesla instead of leaving them destitute / []
This is so insane! / []
That's awesome. Now, fix the medical/Hospital industry/business. It's just as bad as govt of not worse. Make their computer's talk to each other. Hospitals are a business run like a govt. Fix it!!!! / []
Proud of Elon, his team and the mission. 1 billion for 10 questions regarding if we like National Parks? Who got that contract? / []
Meanwhile, people losing jobs at Tesla SMH / []
Get on your rocket ship / []
Turning it digital wont take days. I had to digitize paperwork at my old job and it literally took a year working day in and day out to get every detail correctly recorded and scanned. Stop exaggerating unrealistic timelines / []
👏👏👏 / []
Great interview.  Fantastic! / []
Thank you Mr. Musk!!  You’re Elon Musk and you’re doing an excellent job!!! It’s why our president Trump hired you! Because you’re extremely smart on finding Tax waist.   Every rally Trump said it, and 77 million voted for!! / []
Why is this all not being done before? / []
Can you come do DOGE in Canada, please !! / []
Please get rid of the income taxes or make it a flat tax with no write offs or anything to manipulate/stimulate the economy. / []
Smh might as well belive the tooth fairy / []
Thank you Mr. Musk and DOGE team! God bless you! / []
I recently worked at a supermarket in a role that required the use the of the grocery computer system.  What was immediately apparent was how messy everything was. No one was doing the actual work required to keep the system efficiency high, so everyone just adapted and cut corners and became super specialized in a bad way of doing things. The waste was massive and was getting worse by the day. I offered to work for free at night with a team of experts, sleep in the locker room in sleeping bags to fix it over two weeks but that was rejected.  It will be worse for government systems / []
I was 16 years old in 1976 and I got a job at the Air Force Base where my parents worked.  I worked in a facilities group moving furniture and resources around.  The sergeant came in one day to see how I was doing, and he said, you already done? Don’t work so hard the captain’s just gonna give us more work.   Thankfully, I rejected his lazy mentality and made a good living for myself based on merit, intelligence and working hard / []
If you need a more cost effective survey participant I'm available for a limited time, at a low low price of a couple million. Act before midnight and be sure to use discount code: ORANGE1 / []
imagine what happens in THIS chat group lol / []
Thanks for explaining the audit and restructuring of social security.  Have there been any disruptions to payments to legitimate pensioners? / []
Lefties are in perpetual meltdown mode / []
Elon, there is nothing you can do about the free market. Only MAGA people wants to buy your cars, and they are getting fewer by the day. Tesla is done as a company. / []
God bless and protect these patriots! / []
I loved everything about this conversation. Every American needs to see this. Thank you to the DOGE team that knows how to fix the enormous problem with the technical aspects of this. I don't understand why anyone would be upset with Elon. I thank him wholeheartedly for all his work on MY behalf. / []
I pray a hedge of protection all round elon and his family and all the doge employees and of coarse there family's and i ask this Mark 11 24 therefore I tell you all things you pray and ask for believe that you have received them and you shall have them " in Jesus name!!! / []
This is a team of badasses!!!!!😊❤  THANK YOU ELON AND CREW!!!!! / []
More power to DOGE / []
This is awesome 👏 / []
People never satisfy the need more money! We need people we need people.not people; no bissis let him go to church / []
I thought CBS said the DOGE team was all teenagers ??? I guess CBS said a lot of things that are not true... / []
Thank you Elon Musk for all you're doing for the future of the United States / []
Inspiring! / []
The DogeyDogs ! Release The Hounds ! Ole Big Dog Musk ! He knows His Sh-t ! Those in Congress that hate Him is because He's showing Us how Bad they have done their Job ! / []
Thank you Elon and team!  🎉 / []
WE LOVE YOU GUYS!!!.  Thank you for saving our country!  God bless you!  Please know millions of us are grateful for you and your team, and WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU DAILY.  How about we make it a life sentence felony to intentionally defraud the American people! PLEASE FOLLOW THE MONEY AND LET PAM PROSECUTE! / []
Wow!😮 / []
If you are a democrat cover your eyes and just listen . Use critical thinking. How is this a bad thing? / []
AMERICA LOVES ELON AND LOVES DOGE. KEEP GOING GUYS / []
My Apple 2 E doesn't work anymore.  Lol / []

Republicans is for the American people 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷❤️💯, don't forget there is a lot to clean up behind Biden. / []
👑 Elon and his Doge Team is doing a Great service for America,and the American People. Elon is a True Patriot. Even though he was not born and raised in America, he is more a TrueAmerican then die so cool United States Corrupt Congress Representatives in Washington DC / []
This team of professionals are legit. They're speaking like people who understand software and data. I work in IT and this helps to bring clarity to the work they're doing. Really appreciate this segment. / []
Let Musk do what Trump needs him to do / []
These DOGE members are absolutely BRILLIANT!! THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO HELP SAVE AMERICA 🇺🇸👍🇺🇸 / []
Will CNN show this ? / []
Thank God for Elon. He's literally a superhero serving Americans. How can the democrats oppose him. Turns out the democrats oppose him because he's catching the democrats (and republicans) as they steal. He doesn't care about making more money. He just wants people to love him, and most Americans do. / []
Doge #1 Elon saves the world / []
Bravo to DOGE!!!! / []
How have things been going on like this for so long?  This is insanity!! / ["It's sad to think that individuals now deceased were victims of a fraudulent and antiquated system unbeknownst to them while they lived...", "I wouldn't immediately believe their statements, the only way to know for sure is for them to testify in congress so that they are under oath. They can really say whatever they want on TV", "Because many people most people didn't know. And didn't think it could. Trusted that all there tax money went where it was supposed to. Probably mostly simply because no one really looked into it"]
We love DOGE. Thank you 🙏 / []
lol / []
LOOKS LIKE ... THE ONLY ONES COMPLAINING...ARE THE CRIMINALS.. everyone else loves what Elon and DOGE are doing for the country..  HARD WORKING TAXPAYERS ARE THANKFUL, VERY THANKFUL / []
THANK YOU ALL FOR ALL YOUR WORK YOUR DOING FOR US AMERICAN CITIZENS!! / []
It is obvious that Donald Trump, Elon Musk and, no one in DOGE knows the responsibilities of the thousand of Federal workers who took the Buyout, or the the hundreds of thousands of Federal workers that are being left go.  So we will eventually find out what happened to those responsibilities.  Just think about this, I know more about select agents, than Trump, Musk or DOGE personnel and I might know more about Select Agents than the people charged with handling them at this time. / []
Man i'm proud to be an american now / []
A big matrix / []
The mine. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So outrageous. The expression on Elon's face. 🤣🤣🤣 22nd Century computer mind meets 17th Century paper shuffle kerfuffle. / []
Thank you for this great interview / []
Go DOGE! / []
All BS, Elon is a grifter who wants to loot Social Security and more / []
awesome interview - thank you !    Please keep doing them.   This is so badly needed!! / []
What happened to the days when democrats were for no wars, freedom of speech and responsible government.  Democrats are a joke. / []
What is a stupid person? A stupid person is someone who causes harm to others and does not profit from it themselves - or; who denies the work & success of DOGE. / []
This was so helpful. Thank you / []
He looks tired from all the ketamine / []
So, where's 'Big Balz'? / []
They have arrested one of the terrorists attacking Tesla. / []
Sad interview.  Bret Baier has been one of the best right of center interviewers at some points in time.  But this was about as soft ball of an interview I have seen him do.  No cross examination at all, just allowing these people to do an infomercial.  Won't move anyone on either side of this issue. / []
As a Canadian I do not understand how people are against this / ["For the same reasons Canada won't secure it's border and trade fairly...corruption, and brainwashing.", 'They’ve been brainwashed.', 'It’s funny hearing you say, “as a Canadian”, if it was up to this establishment you’d be an American bud 😭 so I guess it’s good you’re agreeing with our stuff.', 'I agree!', '@koltonreed2205 okay? Not worried about that 0% chance it happens I get why they want that but it won’t happen']
This needs to be a series. Eventually, every American (even the blue ones) will have to admit our government has been so poorly run that change is necessary and only the brightest and the best must oversee it. Godspeed DOGE. / ['Not when all we hear are softball questions with no evidence presented on right wing platforms.  Let them do some media that is not a love fest and answer more challenging questions if they want to move the needle.']
cooked / []
Let's see if CNN, MNBC, CBS will invite this DOGE team for an open forum 😅 / []
This should be on CNN & MSNBC / []
Thank God we have Pres Trump and of all people... *ELON MUSK !!!* / []
They know as well and the democrats don't want to admit it the country is bankrupt and much due to them... / []
Doge harder please Elon. I just looked on net to see a crook in results still apparently operating.   Until I see that sorted I'm going to be on it until it is. My opinions.   Thanks Elon your being kinder than I'd be. / []
What is your mission to cover up all the data collection so you guys can get away with robbing me for my seven quadrillion dollar empire and growing / []
these guys are working there butt off you can see it !!! / []
Thank you Elon and DOGE.  You are all Extraordinary.  So heartedly, sorry 🙏 🙏 for the violence against Tesla, owners, employees and everything about these crimes, we the American people are so very much appreciative and grateful for what you and this Team are doing for America.  God our Father Savior bless you and protect all of you.  You are loved and appreciated by The American People more than you know.  Thank you for your courage, being resilient, supporting and caring for our President and America. / []
Cutting anything with DEI words algorithm / []
lol a bunch of billionaires “cutting government waste”  wow thanks for caring so much! Why don’t you guys go after space x and see how much waste you find / []
A heartfelt THANK YOU to EACH and EVERY ONE of you for your service to our country. All of you are heaven sent to bring TRUTH, TRANSPARENCY and ACCOUNTABILITY. May the LORD guide you and give you discernment in righteousness, grace and justice. In Jesus’ precious name, Amen ❤ / []
👏🙌🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🤞 / []
I hope those men know that a large portion of this country is DEEPLY grateful for their service and sacrifice!  The DOGE team will go down in American history as the program that saved America!! / []
When will DOGE look into the Pentagon budget? / []
This is so ironically and funny me myself. Be in my 60s. I remember sharing stories with other individuals of young. You know, children graduating trying to do work? And I said you will find that they will hire you for a job. And then they're gon to hire someone to watch you do a job and then they're going to hire some one else to watch you. Do a job that they're making sure that the other person's watching. You. Do that job that that person's watching you do the job. And then they hire another person and then.  Five people and then six people are watching you do your job😂😅 / []
Thank you all the Doge guys! wow! / []
Some democrats said Elon and a bunch of kids nosing in the government files these are not kids 😂 / []
Finally the news doing what’s its supposed too / []
This report made me a grown man cry. How is this all possible in today's day and age? / ["I'm 70 years old. I cry a lot over our president and Elon because I know exactly what they're up against.

Elon and the team are doing such a great 👍 job / []
This is a GREAT interview.  Very informative.  If this does not calm people down, then the world is just insane. / []
It's so refreshing to see this administration announce win after win. There's no pouting (hint, hint), only SOLUTIONS and RESULTS! MAGA! 🇺🇲 👐💯🫶✅️ / []
Elon should let the team members speak more. They should be on TV more often, including CNN, MSNBC and other channels. / ['Those guys probably dont want the spot light']

This is a straight up con. Fox is trying to convince their viewers that these corporate wealthy billionaires are working on their behalf. If you fall for this then you'll fall for anything. / ["I've fallen...and I can't get up.", "\u200b@ossoduro7794Stay down there then. There's no hope for you."]

Where was all the young kids? / []

How the hell is Senator Mark Kelly a "traitor" for opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine? If Russia takes Ukraine Putin will expand the Russian empire by 45 million people. How would that be good for The United States? / []
So how are average people benefiting from billionaire tax breaks?  If we are changing over to a computer based system for retirement, how does that affect people currently retiring?

Will the paper documents be transferred into the silicone vault, or will they be maintained as physical documents? / []
Thank you Elon and company! Our debt is the greatest threat to freedom and our future this country faces.  There is no greater cause than saving our children's future. Thanks again! / []
These are eight guys, I would love to get stuck with in a building for about a week. Wish them success. / []
It’s the collaboration with the other teams that makes all this work. Trump picked his cabinet well and they are all carrying out their duties and doing an excellent job!!! Thank you so much, Team Doge! / []
Mine was stolen / []
Sick interview. Love Brett / []
May our God Almighty bless DOGE prime movers to succeed to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. / []
I wish Elon’s team can do a randomly sampling to audit national election system. I bet lots of databases are not talking to each other, voter registration system, vital registration, DMV, or naturalization. I even doubt some states’ data cleanup capabilities such as deduplications etc because if no auditing takes place then no clean data, if no clean data no correct information can be generated. Government agencies need an auditing like DOGE’s. / []

We owe these men a great deal of gratitude.  They are heroes. / ['you never even said that to ur dad one time', 'They are all heros and musk is a god at this point', 'Well said', '@Johnny-n8u1jhow do you have that information', "Put their lives on hold for America ❤🇺🇸🙏 That's true patriotic ❤"]
USA is so blessed that Elon Musk is doing what he is for the country. Most importantly, he genuinely wants to do good and can do so for many years to come. God bless the DOGE team! / []
Well done trump & elon truly 2 genuine people that actually do want the best for their country ❤ / []
Elon rocks!❤ / []
Gets your blood boiling. / ['“Blood boiling?” What do bimbos like you know about “blood?”']
Wow this is something that the American people would have never known, if the Democrats was in office, just not right / []
😂 You democrats that are out there protesting. Wake the heck up listen they're trying to tell you🫵🏾now, take your hands off your ears, stop covering your eyes, and listen👂🏾. HEY FOX CAN WE GET A PART 2 PLEASE!!!!!👏🏾 / []
Ahh, Brett.  First question:  "What is your goal?" asked of a small team just searching.  My response:  Our goal is to avoid stupid interviews by "personalities" paid multi-millions to be "personalities" bent on never-Trump inquiries. / []
Elon surrounded himself with 10 other Elons. / []
This is called a general administrative regularization to reduce crazy expenses and make way for the balance of the country’s regime!! Voilà ✍️🇺🇸🦅🏛 well done Elon and thank you 👏👍 / []
Can DOGE also collaborate with other countries to investigate corruption, in line with the mandate given by the people in those countries? That would be a positive step. / []
The only people who disagree.... Communist Dems! / []
All of these people are billionaires and multi millionaires. I can guarantee you that they do not have the best interest of the average American citizen at heart. They want to make money. / []
Geez - Elon is the greatest !!! / []
Elon, Keep Draining the Swamp. Your a True Patriot.  You are Loved and Greatly Appreciated ❤ 🇺🇸 ❤ 🇺🇸 ❤ 🇺🇸 ❤ 🇺🇸 / []
Thank you Bret foe a great imformative interview. / []
Well done! These guys are machines ! / []
When the interest on your debt is 1 trillion dollars and it is the biggest cost to the government bigger than your department of defense and your social programs you're about to go bankrupt. That's where America stands right now almost bankrupt. Thank you Elon and your team for saving America ♥️ / []
Bret you are so brilliant,You have a Congress of the most brilliant together on your show WOW this is genius. / []
How can any Amercian tax payer be against this? / []

Awesome interview 👍 / []
Can't believe theese hoolagins..... they come in and start doing things. I heard they were the reason why babies cry...... the the reason why people get rain in their shoes when walking through a puddle. I even heard they are the masterminds behind why the mcflurry machines are always out of order. Monsters! / []
Which one of them is big balls? / []
Love these guys! They are focused. The Democraps are nefarious losers. / []
They don’t have to do this. These brilliant minds could be getting paid so much more doing other things. Thank God for President Trump and these patriots / []
Rocket scientist: Now that's competence! So many in the government are mere derilects......rocket scientist: that speaks volumes for itself..... / []

To the  corrupt  Politician this team is enemy . Because the money machines are getting shut down.. that’s why they hate doge team … 🇺🇸 first !.. / []
Thank you, Donald Trump make America great again / []
What a team. These people are not there for the money or carrier advancement. These are accomplished group of individuals who signed up for the greatest cause. Dismantle the deep state and their corruption scheme. Proud of you all.  Great leader attracts great people indeed. MAGA all the way. / []
Fight Club! / []
Let's  " Put America 🇺🇸 First ", by telling OUR GREEN liberal  " FBI DOJ DOD and CIA " to Quit Lying and instead choose to SUPPORT OUR LAW enforcement  !      😮 / []
Only a lunatic with an agenda would disagree or protest DOGE. / []
Look at all these 19 year olds. Dems, you got played / []
Brave people! Thank you!!! / []
PLEASE BROACAST THIS NATIONWIDE. / []
America is a business, it’s about time it gets operated like a business. The problem is politicians who have never been in the private sector, they are clueless how this is supposed to work. Thank you America for electing a businessman to run things, and thank you DOGE. The loudest protestors are the biggest fraudsters. / []
Amen thank you so much / []
Thank you ELON MUSK FOR YOUR SERVICE / []
Praying for your team 🙏🙌🏻 / []
Bret Baier is a true rat. He is a RINo and a never Trumper and a RINO is the only thing worse than a Democrat. / []
Trump and President Musk said they wanted to cut $2 trillion from the budget. So, they are firing federal workers whose salaries account for about $294 billion of the budget. Makes sense🙄 / []
It all has to be done, but we shouldn't ignore what this will mean for the constitutional rights being infringed on in the future. I don't know how, but it always ends up that way. / []
Thank you Elon / []
Ooh musk how’s your ketamine addiction / []

Get these private entities out our records!! / []

Thank you everyone. / []
Their goal is to cut social security and Medicare and give more tax breaks to billionaires / []
Come to Australia and clean up our books as well / []
But without Congress and the Senate making laws to make sure this stuff goes through and make sure when Democrats get back into power they cannot continue down the same path destroying America abusing the tax pair like we’re their own personal, freaking piggy Banc / []
Only a fool would legitimately be against this, or a paid propagandist / []
But I want to see who's getting arrested for the money laundering!💯 / []
W not. Need those! People involved in My social security l work for stop / []
All of this positive research we can thank President Trump.  However when do we ever hear a thank you just for President Trump.  I am right now saying my thankyou. / []
Thank You, GOD! 💞🇺🇸🙏✌👍 / []
I wonder if those people who work under ground in the retirement mine, i wonder if they know we have airplanes that fly around the world.  That we landed people on the moon. That North defeated the South? / []
The government agencies are morbidly obese. Every one of the watch dogs adopted a "don't-rock-the-boat" attitude or did not have the resources and clout (as Elon Musk) to change the status quo. This is so badly needed. / []
I believe they're using their intelligence that God gave them. / []
Fox digital views in the 🍊🤡's golden 🚽 this week!  😂 / []
This is amazing interview / []
Only  corrupt Democrats would oppose something like this / []

I wish we could see the results of both timelines, 10 years into the future, this one and the one whereas the left won. / []
Musk gets billions of dollars for his companies, while normal people pay the price.. / []
All those doctume ya are digitized but the paper is there to back up. / []
He said $4B a day seven days a week. He also said very close to the $1T goal in 130 days. $4B a day is about 50% of that. The math ain't mathing. I'll be shocked if their efforts make so much as a dent in the deficit. Tax the rich corporations! / []

Thank you Mr. Musk. / []
THANK YOU ALL for updating our government.  We all have had to update our lives and jobs our whole life. It's about time someone had the BALLS to do this. Thank you and President Trump AGAIN / []

Obviously, there are lots of stealing by lots of groups, wow?! / []
The entire regime is deranged. They deserve everything they get. I see Musk has laid off 6000 workers. / []
We need to have at least three Republican administrations and full control of both houses for as long to eliminate all this debt and put the us on a strong footing so this never continues, ever. Democrats don’t want this. It’s hard to understand why other than they’re so corrupt and so greedy. They will never stop lying unless they lose constantly for 12 years. / []
Whinny liberals will find anything to fukin complain about. But most of the people that complain can't even run their own fuking check books, but they want to tell the government how to do theirs 🖕  fuk California  New York  Connecticut etc, sanctuary states.  Liberal shlt holes ... / []

What a great interview by Brett , Elon, and his doge team!!   Thank you gor everything you are doing. I am on so ial security and medicaid. And have had issues with the inefficiencies of that department. Where they charged my account a fine for not having part D when I did have part D. Then when i finally got to speak with someone, bthey dont refund their error. Its like they think i am wealthy or something. But i was grateful to get it resolved,  it happened for about 6 months, and it has been fine. But our local office never brought everyone back after the pandemic. Many of them are only in thd office certain days,  or a couple of times monthly. So getting an appointment to resolvd things is impossible. And you just hope someone answers the voicemail the system had you leave. I was able to get my problems resolved. And it has been smooth since. But its kind of riciculous. / []

As for the government credit cards, the active duty mission essential personnel are issued cards.  Why?  I was an aircraft mechanic.  If the Lockheed Martin C-5 diverted to an airfield for an emergency, I get called and need to buy a civilian airline ticket, rent a car and either fly back on the C-5 or stay in a hotel and fly back civilian.  We don't make enough money to make these expensive reservations.  So that's why there's millions of government credit cards.  By the way when we return to our home base we file a travel voucher with all of our receipts and the AF pays the card off.  So we can pass an audit in this case anyway. / []

I'm 70, my wife is 76.  About five years ago we started getting phone calls from companies offering us free items, such as back and knee braces, and other medical equipment.  I asked how they could give us free stuff like this.  They said it was all covered by our Medicare.  And when I thought about it, I realized that these companies with the ability to offer free stuff to anyone over the age of 65 (who are ALL required to be signed up for Medicare), and who have it paid for by Medicare, must be making money hand over fist. So, is DOGE fixing this? / []

Two trillion dollar deficits started under trumps first term.  During Obama we had it down to 650 billion dollars in deficit.  Bush started the trillion dollar deficits..  Obama followed suit but it did go down (not because of him but because forced sequestration)...  It started increasing during Obama's final years again.  Then president Trump increased the deficit again until ultimately it sky rocketed due to covid spending.   Biden pretty well continued that spending trend and even increased it post covid (which is crazy)...      Make no mistake;  cutting only a trillion dollars and spending six trillion dollars is in no way what a small constitutional government looks like.   Spending needs to be cut to 4 trillion dollars and revenue needs to be 6 trillion so we can start beating back the national debt.    Elon and musk are proposing a trillion dollar deficit.  You can't get rid of debt by deficit spending. / []

Elon, if these words ever find their way to you, know this — God is not blind to the devastation you endure, nor deaf to the cries of those who stand for truth. What has been torn down by the hands of the wicked shall, in time, be restored by the hand of God Himself. You are waging a battle few have the courage to fight — the battle of true sacrifice.  History will remember you, not merely as a man of brilliance, but as a man who laid down his own name, reputation, and worldly success for the sake of liberty, for the sake of truth, and for the soul of this nation. Your son will one day stand tall, knowing his father chose the harder path — not for fortune, but for freedom.  Thank you, Elon.

While his brother and other board members are dumping stock like crazy and getting rich, Elon is asking his own employees to do the opposite and hold.  The guy pays actual (nameless) geniuses to work for him, claims all the credit, then pays a fortune in bots to promote his image with propagandist nonsense.

Of course if everything is that antiquated. It’s like they’re still writing w quill pens LOL or people w phones still attached to a kitchen wall w curly chord. Shame on folks for condemning this!!! I support Elon and DOGE / []

I told people that Elon's team is not a bunch of 19 year old techies.  He need financial experts (CPAs, forensic accountants, financial data experts....etc) working with him  to find the money and flaws in the system.   Take a closer look at his team.  Do they look like 19 year old inexperience financial professionals.  They are elites in their field. / []

Interesting because any normal peasant, American citizen has to show their drivers license and proof of age bank records, all sorts of things to get a small business loan.

Most people think bankruptcy is not a problem because they have seen a lot of people go bankrupt and survive.  They need to have a clear explanation of the difference between the consequences of personal bankruptcy and the government bankruptcy. / []
The reason for Doge is that the Democrats in 4 years stole 4 trillion dollars. 1 trillion dollars every year. Then they tried to cover all their tracks on the computer. They thought this was a final thumb of their nose at president Trump. Go ahead and try to find all the corruption.  Not only that China is threatening the United States. China wants to go to war.  Very simply China says.... If you want to be the one world superpower... If you can beat China in a world war.. then you are the One world super power.... That means the US government needs 8 to 10 trillion dollars to go to war with China.  The bidens were going to bankrupt the country and hand the country over to China. / []

Enron Musk & tRUmp don't care about the debt... The IRS has been falling behind tax cheats for years, mainly because Republicans cut the agency’s budget whenever they have control of Congress. There’s an annual “tax gap” — the amount of money people owe that the IRS fails to collect — of nearly $700 billion. That’s an enormous amount of money, almost equivalent to the whole Pentagon budget.  Cutting 7,000 IRS staffers would save about $7 billion in personnel costs over a decade, but lead to $71 billion in foregone tax revenue. That’s $64 billion added to the national debt.  Cutting 50,000 staffers would save $45 billion in personnel costs over a decade while cutting the amount of collected tax revenue by $323 billion. That’s $286 billion added to the national debt.  Source: Yahoo Finance  The DOGE hasn't saved $10 billion. $7.7B verifiable. We're getting run off the rails for something that can be fixed with a modest 2% tax on robber barons and a functional IRS! / []
