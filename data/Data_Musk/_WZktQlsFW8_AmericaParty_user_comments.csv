That seems like a good idea so far to make a Third Political group. But got to be careful because there are alleged bribed corrupted politicians around the the world that have been bought by many types of rich criminals. Like the Yakuza that bought some Japan Corrupted Politicians. Plus Triads that bought some China corrupted politicians. Even North America has corrupted politicians in both the Democrats plus the Republicans. Also not saying the Third Political group is corrupted but look at the Purge Movie series they gotten a Third Political group called the New Founding Fathers that is made up of a bunch blind stubborn wreckless pricks that nearly destroyed America making every crime activities legal for 2 in a half days in a event they call the Purge granting Ranked 10 government officials immunity from the Purge except for that Election year movie but gets worse in the Forever Purge because after the siren emitted the loud alarm they still kept going to do many crimes putting every American states to martial law even Hawaii plus Alaska which then resulted in not just blaming plus hunting the New Founding Fathers but getting the New Founding Fathers Killed. Not saying that is gonna happen not even saying that's what they're gonna the New Third Political group but just saying better make sure they don't get much if at all Corrupted by bribe money from any criminals nor cause much worse problems than before so they gotta make everything better by getting rid of Problems fast.,[],2025-07-14T21:53:54Z,@gabrielivan2538

"The United States could very well be ready for an American Conservative party  now that the Republican party has abandoned fiscal responsibility as part of its platform. I do not think this should be Elon driven and would much rather see those like Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney and the like get this off the ground. Elon can certainly provide some support from the sidelines but better to stay away from any organizational role.  No current sitting Republican member of the house or senate should qualify to run for such a party based on where thay have placed their votes. I generall lean left of center but understand the need to have ideas which lean right of center. The current Republican party is mostly about hate and division which should have no place as an established political party in the United States. I would not necessarily see an American Conservative party as a 3rd party but as a replacement for the Republican party that has been hijacked, and stained beyond repair.  The expectation is that the GOP would disappear as an option all together.",[],2025-07-08T14:32:41Z,@WillFlynn-f8z

"If Elon Musk is working with the band, Starset, then this world is is GIANT trouble!!! Dustin Bates of Starset has been working on mind-manipulation/ thought-control tactics for years and it works. If Elon is starting a new political party, someone better make sure that Dustin Bates and Starset are not part of that. If they are, Elon has the money and Dustin has the desire for global takeover. I'm Bojana Randall, artist, quantum theorist, singer/songwriter, etc... Starset has been manipulating my mind this way and I've been overriding it to the best of my ability. I've been trying to warn people that they are capapble of inflicting pain on others via trigger words. They used Musk's Neuralink, xAI, and Starlink... if that many of Musk's things are part of this, it's likely that Musk is involved... especially since I reached out to both Neuralink and xAi and have been ignored regarding the issue. Are they working together to take over the world by force? Is this new political ""party"" only political on a conversational level? Young people will vote for it because they're all relatable to the younger generations. And even if they're not, they'll be manipulated into doing it. I have a 19-year old son and Dustin has been attacking us for years via frequencies that induce certain behaviors. I knwo my kid well and I know when his beahvior is uncharacteristsic. I see what these people are doing... The world better open its eyes. Who do I speak with when the UN, Pentagon, Homeland Security, and others have dismissed the idea? Is it that they don't understand it? Someone had better speak with me then, otherwise, prepare for the world to go up in smoke. These people are turning others against me. They follow me wherever I go and follow up with jading their opinions of me. Be careful about who you trust and why. Dustin is a master-manipulator. He hates the ""rich"". I know his brother has a political agenda. Dustin's ""Starset Society"" is in it, and that's composed of his family and friends. He uses his PhD status to manipulate others' insecurities to obtain thei compliance. Let me know if you want to discuss further. I don't know what to do since Dustin kinda has control of people's perceptions. These people have money and I don't, since they deliberately preventd me from making it by hacking my computer, stealing my art, and destroying my life, apparently because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. ""you're either with us or against us"". I'm against them. Thought-control is 100% wrong. Someone inform the United Nations Human Rights. I tried, but they ignored it.

I cannot even renew my expired passport because the Embassy in Moscow denies passport services. They sanction their own citizens who did nothing wrong. Such an evil country has no future.

"The Truth Revealed
Are you US citizens going to allow this to happen AGAIN:
You US citizens made a HUGE MISTAKE when you voted the CLOWN trump into the white house (I hope you understand this). Then the CLOWN trump chose the CIRCUS into the white house as his assistants, which were US oligarks, and their goal to get ritch on the people thrugh LIES and SCMMING attetude.
elon musk was one of the LIARS and FALSEHOOD, who were given the task of carrying out unbelievably awful things against the US population. elon musk did it with joy (according to himself). elon musk helped the CLOWN trump because he got RICHER doing it, and it is was BIG MONEY!!!

Think about what you US citizens are doing THIS TIME:
Are you going to make the SAME MISTAKE AGAIN with the FASCIST NAZIST elon musk. A usurer who gives a damn about EVERYONE else but himself. He is good at hiding this fact I must admit???
Is money everything in this world. Is there NO morality and ethics in ledership anymore???
Should politics be governed by the personal wealth of leaders or shall they have a human side. Especially towards their own people which elon musk DEFINITIVELY LACKS???

Now elon musk wants to control the future of the USA under FALSE promises:
The musk family dates back to the 40s in Germany. Where they were closely tied to the FASCIST NAZI MOVEMENT under HITLERS govern. There is no doubt about that. There is plenty of info to find on this.
Elon musk's father ended up IN SOUTH AFRICA as the WHITE population and exploited the POOR BLACK POPULATION to EARN HIS WEALTH. That piriod is called APARTHEID and means that the WHITES HAD BLACK SLAVE LABOR AND OPPRESSION. Musk's father pushed the BLACK SLAVE LABORERS to their limit and there were some de@ths. His welth can UNDOUBTEDLY be called BL@OD MONEY.
His father is nothing but a DISGUSTING HUMAN OPPRESSOR, an attitude little elon grew up with. No wonder little elon became a BULLY!!!

Elon musk is SOUTH AFRICAN and NOT a tru US citizen. He has clearly shown during a public appearance that he is a FASCIST NAZIST by doing the HITLER SALVATION multiple times (NO DOUBT ABOUT IT).
Elon musk fired 1000s of workers without the SLIGHTEST REGRET and he enjoyed his assignment he received from the CLOWN trump. ""HE ENJOYED IT""!!!
Elon musk went to school in the US and his education was paid for by his father's BL@OD MONEY.
Elon musk bought an ALREADY DEVELOPED electric car company through LIES, BULLYING and FALSE promises according to the previous owners. He used 33 million $ (according to himself) of his father's BL@OD MONEY to steal it and named it Tesla. What a SCANDAL noone wants to hear and admit.
Elon musk is NOT an inventor and dos NOT do the work of creating anything but it is done by SKILLED engineers and workers. 
In the business world he is a skilled h@oligan, imp@ster and deceiving the whole world with his LIES of Tesla. Which has made him very rich on IGNORANT people ho believed him and still dos. Howe st@pid can someone be.

when he is NOT licking @ss as he is doing today. There is much more hirendos truth to know about him. Howe INHUMAN SCANDALOUS BULLYING he ortherwise is towards people and specially against his staff!!!

THE US CITIZENS CONSUMERS COOPERATIVE PARTY AND TRUST FUND AND ACT OF 2025

TITLE I: PURPOSE AND DECLARATION

Let this be known:
To every investor profiting off human necessity — your reign is over. To every politician who stalled for decades — the people will remember. And to every American who believed nothing could ever change — it just did.

The American people have waited long enough.
While CEOs reward themselves billions, families ration insulin.
While grocery giants report record profits, children skip meals.
While energy conglomerates buy back their own stock, working Americans freeze in winter and bake in summer.
We are not poor. We have been robbed.
And every citizen knows it. Every family scraping by, every veteran in a homeless shelter, every teacher working two jobs. We know who owns this economy, and we know they will not change unless we force it.

This Act is not a request. It is the people's demand, delivered with full constitutional and democratic authority.

TITLE II: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE US CITIZENS COOPERATIVE PARTY AND TRUST FUND (USCCC)

SECTION 201.  Congress shall authorize the immediate establishment of a sovereign, independent, public Trust Fund titled the US Citizens Consumers Cooperative Trust Fund (USCCC).
SECTION 202. MISSION To reclaim the economy of basic human needs from for-profit ownership and convert it into a nonprofit, citizen-owned infrastructure that guarantees:
Living wages for workers
Stable, affordable prices for consumers
Protection from speculation and monopolistic abuse

SECTION 203. TARGET INDUSTRIES: The USCCC would be empowered to acquire, operate, and convert corporations and infrastructure to Non-Profit Entities related to:
Food (farming, processing, retail)
Energy (fuel, electricity, solar, wind, oil & gas)
Healthcare (providers, hospitals, pharmaceutical producers)
Housing (builders, landlords, property developers)
Transportation (logistics, rail, shipping)
Water and utilities (broadband, clean water access)

TITLE III: FUNDING AND CAPITALIZATION

SECTION 301. FEDERAL SEED FUNDING 
Initial capitalization of $250 billion USD, to be appropriated immediately from:
Elimination of corporate subsidies for publicly traded companies
A windfall tax on post-pandemic profits of Fortune 500 companies
Closure of offshore loopholes and tax havens
A 10% levy on CEO compensation over $20 million annually
Transfer of unredeemed COVID stimulus funds held in reserve
SECTION 302. PUBLIC DONATIONS AND BONDS
US citizens may donate tax-deductible contributions to the Trust
Option to purchase Citizen Sovereignty Bonds with a guaranteed inflation hedge return
Matching grants from state and municipal governments
The IRS Collects 4 Trillion from Working US Citizens annually. Possible voluntary one third income tax to be held and allocated toward Trust Fund 

TITLE IV: POWERS AND OPERATIONS
SECTION 401. NEGOTIATED BUYOUTS 
The Fund shall engage in direct negotiation for share buyouts of target corporations, with emphasis on divisions and subsidiaries directly related to public needs.

SECTION 402. NONPROFIT TRANSFORMATION 
All acquired entities shall:
Be transitioned into nonprofit cooperative enterprises
Cap executive compensation at 10x the lowest-paid full-time employee
Offer democratic representation to workers and consumers

SECTION 403. NATIONALIZATION PROTOCOL 
In cases of refusal, obstruction, or bad faith, the USCCC shall be empowered to recommend and execute nationalization under existing eminent domain statutes for essential services.

TITLE V: TRANSPARENCY, GOVERNANCE, AND PROTECTION
SECTION 501. PEOPLE'S OVERSIGHT BOARD
15-person board elected by popular vote every 4 years
No corporate donors, PACs, or lobbyists may participate in elections

SECTION 502. PUBLIC LEDGER
All buyouts, financial reports, and wage ratios will be published quarterly

SECTION 503. LEGAL PROTECTIONS
Assets held by the USCCC may not be sold, transferred, or privatized without a national referendum

TITLE VI: TIMELINE AND ENFORCEMENT
This Act shall go into effect within 30 days of passage
First wave of acquisition targets to be announced within 90 days
USCCC Trust must begin operations within 180 days

This is the end of profit from pain. This is the dawn of public, not private or government power.

SUMMARY: This Trust Fund would only be used to use the Free Market and Capitalist system against those who put high profits over the welfare of the working class and consumer. 
The Bill or Measure would not seek to change the habits of Oligarchs, it would seek to create a separate economy based on Psychologists Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, including Security, Safety and Self-Actualization. Humans can't self-actualize as long as they are struggling to meet their everyday needs. 

If everyone was prospering, we could see crime go down dramatically. 

Example Corporations to buy and convert to Non-Profit. Using the net profits to raise wages 'above' the norm. Lower cost of living 'below' the norm. 

Food. 
Kroger's $46 Billion""
Albertsons, $24 Billion
Safeway  $9 Billion

Energy. 
PG&E $30 Billion. 

Oil/Gas 
Chevron $256 Billion.

WE would buy or build the following. 
Land, farms, food processing plants, distribution networks, production, manufacturing, of products, including those needed to build homes and other structures, that meet our needs. Including Transportation, Technology, 

This is not Socialism because it would use the same free and fair market, capitalist system Oligarchs use to become wealthy. Instead of wealth going to shareholders, stock brokers and traders who contribute nothing but get a dividend check every third quarter, All Corporations under the Trust Fund would be pulled from the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Let what happens on Wall Street stay on Wall Street. It will no longer affect the flow of food, goods and services or raise the cost.",[],2025-07-06T21:52:03Z,@davidphillips8919

Still funny to me how people still believe that it actually matters which political party is in power in the usa or uk. Just a smoke screen,"[""It is *extremely* important which political party is power. Everywhere. Not just in the US or the UK.\n\nTake the post-WWI Germany, for instance. If Hitler's party did not get to power, there would not be WWII as we know it. Take Russia, for example. If Putin's party was not in power, there would not be a full-scale war in Ukraine. If you consider today's Britain, the Nigel Farage's party seems to be on its way to dismantle democracy in the UK. And the today's Republican party in the US consists mostly of non-critical supporters of everything and anything that Trump does. It is very similar to a Trump cult. In Hungary, for instance, the party of Viktor Orbán is another example of an authoritarian party which would like to dismantle the democracy not only in Hungary but in the entire EU.\n\nSo, to reiterate, it is *extremely* important which political party is in power. Most of them are really trying to help their citizens. But some of them are just vehicles to get power and their leaders would not hesitate to do anything to remain in power. It is very important to distinguish between these kind of political parties and politicians.""]",2025-07-06T20:59:11Z,@FreeTheWorld82

"It's another SCAM:   AI Overview
Elon Musk has been associated with various scams and fraudulent activities, often involving the use of his image and likeness in deepfake videos promoting fake investments. These scams utilize AI technology to generate convincing fake videos and audio, tricking individuals into believing they are investing in legitimate ventures. 
Here's a breakdown of the issue: 
Deepfake Scams:
Scammers use AI to create fake videos of Musk (and other celebrities) promoting bogus investments, particularly in cryptocurrency platforms like Quantum AI.
Financial Fraud:
These scams often involve luring victims with promises of high returns and then stealing their money through fraudulent investment platforms.
Common Scams:
Scammers use Musk's image in various fake ads, including those promising energy-saving devices and investment opportunities.
Scale of the Problem:
The use of deepfakes in these scams is widespread, with many appearing on platforms like Facebook and YouTube.
Lack of Response:
Musk has not publicly commented on the scams, but his image is frequently used in these fraudulent activities.

"LIBERTY OF MAN PAST & NOW - 2025??
Liberty is to be free and independent
Without slavery, imprisonment, or loss of right.
Though bit-by-bit many try to steal it away
For if they were to take it all at once, we'd fight.

So protect your liberty that others don't have 
For beside life, there's nothing more precious on Earth.
Too many have yearned, fought, suffered, and died for it
And we must never lose sight of what liberty is worth.

Evil loves to strike liberty from the cheeks of all
And it's been that way since the beginning of time.
For a mind that's not allowed to have a free thought
Becomes but a slave to the masters of mankind.

If Washington and Lincoln were alive and well
And spoke of America’s troubles we face today.
I wonder what they might faithfully suggest
And would we heed to anything they would say?
