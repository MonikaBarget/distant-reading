The fact that Elon musk relies on the republican electorate will only damage the republican camp. Democrats might win the midterms with divided republicans	[]

The most deadly thing now is that the CCP has begun to implement high-pressure rule. In the past two days, the registration of online ID cards has begun! Two professors opposed it, and they were both blocked. In the future, the right to speak on online platforms such as TikTok will be completely gambled away! I also hope that the great and free and democratic American authorities will speed up the coordinated use of force to crack down on the CCP and create an opportunity for the mainland people to rebel!

That seems like a good idea so far to make a Third Political group. But got to be careful because there are alleged bribed corrupted politicians around the the world that have been bought by many types of rich criminals. Like the Yakuza that bought some Japan Corrupted Politicians. Plus Triads that bought some China corrupted politicians. Even North America has corrupted politicians in both the Democrats plus the Republicans. Also not saying the Third Political group is corrupted but look at the Purge Movie series they gotten a Third Political group called the New Founding Fathers that is made up of a bunch blind stubborn wreckless pricks that nearly destroyed America making every crime activities legal for 2 in a half days in a event they call the Purge granting Ranked 10 government officials immunity from the Purge except for that Election year movie but gets worse in the Forever Purge because after the siren emitted the loud alarm they still kept going to do many crimes putting every American states to martial law even Hawaii plus Alaska which then resulted in not just blaming plus hunting the New Founding Fathers but getting the New Founding Fathers Killed. Not saying that is gonna happen not even saying that's what they're gonna the New Third Political group but just saying better make sure they don't get much if at all Corrupted by bribe money from any criminals nor cause much worse problems than before so they gotta make everything better by getting rid of Problems fast.

Elon - look, I really liked you and enjoyed listening to you. However, once you got into politics you have (in my opinion) become just another politician with your head firmly up your ass. You are becoming just like the crap you rave against. Just keep doing what your good at - missiles and ev autos to name just two. If you don’t get out of politics I will no longer support you. You don’t need it and are doing yourself a disservice. Come on, use your head rather than your ego. Let trump do what he wants and get out of that.	[]

Elon rigged one election. He can do it again	[]
The United States could very well be ready for an American Conservative party  now that the Republican party has abandoned fiscal responsibility as part of its platform. I do not think this should be Elon driven and would much rather see those like Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney and the like get this off the ground. Elon can certainly provide some support from the sidelines but better to stay away from any organizational role.  No current sitting Republican member of the house or senate should qualify to run for such a party based on where thay have placed their votes. I generall lean left of center but understand the need to have ideas which lean right of center. The current Republican party is mostly about hate and division which should have no place as an established political party in the United States. I would not necessarily see an American Conservative party as a 3rd party but as a replacement for the Republican party that has been hijacked, and stained beyond repair.  The expectation is that the GOP would disappear as an option all together.	[]
Trump is the real enemy of America. Trump is destroying America for his personal interests.  Trump wants to make all his offsprings and relatives richest men of the planet at the cost of America.	[]

Another Israel 🇮🇱  party that supports mass murder?	[]
If Elon Musk is working with the band, Starset, then this world is is GIANT trouble!!! Dustin Bates of Starset has been working on mind-manipulation/ thought-control tactics for years and it works. If Elon is starting a new political party, someone better make sure that Dustin Bates and Starset are not part of that. If they are, Elon has the money and Dustin has the desire for global takeover. I'm Bojana Randall, artist, quantum theorist, singer/songwriter, etc... Starset has been manipulating my mind this way and I've been overriding it to the best of my ability. I've been trying to warn people that they are capapble of inflicting pain on others via trigger words. They used Musk's Neuralink, xAI, and Starlink... if that many of Musk's things are part of this, it's likely that Musk is involved... especially since I reached out to both Neuralink and xAi and have been ignored regarding the issue. Are they working together to take over the world by force? Is this new political "party" only political on a conversational level? Young people will vote for it because they're all relatable to the younger generations. And even if they're not, they'll be manipulated into doing it. I have a 19-year old son and Dustin has been attacking us for years via frequencies that induce certain behaviors. I knwo my kid well and I know when his beahvior is uncharacteristsic. I see what these people are doing... The world better open its eyes. Who do I speak with when the UN, Pentagon, Homeland Security, and others have dismissed the idea? Is it that they don't understand it? Someone had better speak with me then, otherwise, prepare for the world to go up in smoke. These people are turning others against me. They follow me wherever I go and follow up with jading their opinions of me. Be careful about who you trust and why. Dustin is a master-manipulator. He hates the "rich". I know his brother has a political agenda. Dustin's "Starset Society" is in it, and that's composed of his family and friends. He uses his PhD status to manipulate others' insecurities to obtain thei compliance. Let me know if you want to discuss further. I don't know what to do since Dustin kinda has control of people's perceptions. These people have money and I don't, since they deliberately preventd me from making it by hacking my computer, stealing my art, and destroying my life, apparently because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. "you're either with us or against us". I'm against them. Thought-control is 100% wrong. Someone inform the United Nations Human Rights. I tried, but they ignored it. Maybe when pain strikes they'll pay attention... but won't it be too late by then?	[]
So another criminal, ballot buying, election fraud, Nazi saluting party is starting up by an over rich guy and not only are the Divided States going to allow it, you now have two Nazi Parties. Just kiss your ass good-bye. You’ve learned nothing.	[]

The Dawn of Modern era.	[]
I am a retired expat in Russia. I resettled there when there were nice relationships between two countries because I couldn’t survive within the US on my retirement paycheck. All of a sudden the notice appeared on the site of the Embassy that all Americans should leave Russia and then Social Security cut off my retirement benefits. I am too old to resettle again and I have no money for that. I can only go to the street begging in a foreign country. The government of a civilized country must not tell an elderly person, “We’ll cut off your retirement benefits unless you resettle to a different country”. I feel betrayed and defrauded. What kind of country is it, which doesn’t honor its obligations to the citizens abusing the most vulnerable class? I cannot even renew my expired passport because the Embassy in Moscow denies passport services. They sanction their own citizens who did nothing wrong. Such an evil country has no future. Trump promised to dismiss all Biden’s executive orders, but he still has done nothing about it. Indeed each following president has always been more evil than previous one. No wonder people in the world hate the US.	[]

Ya, I'm going to start the party of "fuk em all" where people have the power and politicians pay the taxes. Credits from big corporations and the incredibly rich will be deposited into everyone's accounts for food/housing. Free medical, free energy. Ideas? Why not? It appears we have an open slate to make it how we want.	[]
Many have tried and failed to create a significant third party (or actually second party, since the dems and reps are one party controlled by aipac). If Musk can succeed, this will break open American politics, and the US might even end up having something resembling a democracy.	[]
US political culture is the same as the political culture of countries on the African continent	[]
The political culture in the US is very similar to Indonesia during the Suharto era, only the Indonesian people are very intelligent, unlike the US people and society who are super stupid.	[]
Elon Musk has fought against the old US political culture which is primitive and unfit for this era. The current US political culture is a reflection of the very primitive thinking ability of the US nation.	[]

Truth is IMHO, a third party is exactly what is needed for the country. Independents have a limited following whereas a NEW PARTY would remove some idiots that vote Democrat because the media is brainwashing them with their skeptical views & narratives. Might take a couple of republican votes but American Republicans & undecided voters DEMANDED & VOTED FOR CHANGE FROM THE THEFT & GRIFT OF THE DEMOCRATS. Good move Elon. Trump is a legendary President.	[]

Musk is on a power trip. Going to Trump rallies with huge audiences went to his head. Thinking they were praising him. He followed Trump everywhere.  Overstayed at Trump's resort. No respect for him. He should have had private conversations. Not make horrible statements about Trump.  I think Trump thought they were friends. Looking at pictures of Musk. He doesn't act normally. The weird faces and looks he makes. Concerning his wild behavior. Now creating another Party?	[]

The Truth Revealed\nAre you US citizens going to allow this to happen AGAIN:\nYou US citizens made a HUGE MISTAKE when you voted the CLOWN trump into the white house (I hope you understand this). Then the CLOWN trump chose the CIRCUS into the white house as his assistants, which were US oligarks, and their goal to get ritch on the people thrugh LIES and SCMMING attetude.\nelon musk was one of the LIARS and FALSEHOOD, who were given the task of carrying out unbelievably awful things against the US population. elon musk did it with joy (according to himself). elon musk helped the CLOWN trump because he got RICHER doing it, and it is was BIG MONEY!!!\n\nThink about what you US citizens are doing THIS TIME:\nAre you going to make the SAME MISTAKE AGAIN with the FASCIST NAZIST elon musk. A usurer who gives a damn about EVERYONE else but himself. He is good at hiding this fact I must admit???\nIs money everything in this world. Is there NO morality and ethics in ledership anymore???\nShould politics be governed by the personal wealth of leaders or shall they have a human side. Especially towards their own people which elon musk DEFINITIVELY LACKS???\n\nNow elon musk wants to control the future of the USA under FALSE promises:\nThe musk family dates back to the 40s in Germany. Where they were closely tied to the FASCIST NAZI MOVEMENT under HITLERS govern. There is no doubt about that. There is plenty of info to find on this.\nElon musk's father ended up IN SOUTH AFRICA as the WHITE population and exploited the POOR BLACK POPULATION to EARN HIS WEALTH. That piriod is called APARTHEID and means that the WHITES HAD BLACK SLAVE LABOR AND OPPRESSION. Musk's father pushed the BLACK SLAVE LABORERS to their limit and there were some de@ths. His welth can UNDOUBTEDLY be called BL@OD MONEY.\nHis father is nothing but a DISGUSTING HUMAN OPPRESSOR, an attitude little elon grew up with. No wonder little elon became a BULLY!!!\n\nElon musk is SOUTH AFRICAN and NOT a tru US citizen. He has clearly shown during a public appearance that he is a FASCIST NAZIST by doing the HITLER SALVATION multiple times (NO DOUBT ABOUT IT).\nElon musk fired 1000s of workers without the SLIGHTEST REGRET and he enjoyed his assignment he received from the CLOWN trump. "HE ENJOYED IT"!!!\nElon musk went to school in the US and his education was paid for by his father's BL@OD MONEY.\nElon musk bought an ALREADY DEVELOPED electric car company through LIES, BULLYING and FALSE promises according to the previous owners. He used 33 million $ (according to himself) of his father's BL@OD MONEY to steal it and named it Tesla. What a SCANDAL noone wants to hear and admit.\nElon musk is NOT an inventor and dos NOT do the work of creating anything but it is done by SKILLED engineers and workers. \nIn the business world he is a skilled h@oligan, imp@ster and deceiving the whole world with his LIES of Tesla. Which has made him very rich on IGNORANT people ho believed him and still dos. Howe st@pid can someone be.\n\nwhen he is NOT licking @ss as he is doing today. There is much more hirendos truth to know about him. Howe INHUMAN SCANDALOUS BULLYING he ortherwise is towards people and specially against his staff!!!\nWhat ive heard happend in Sweden. Ask him what happend there???	[]

He wont be launching any NASA systems to Mars that for sure 😁	[]
A South African is going to tell us how to redesign the US government? It was not perfect but it was not chaos everyday until Trump came along. Musk is still a Trump devotee don't be fooled.	[]
Elon musk has underestimated how unpopular he is🤣	[]
We don't need another party we need to changes the vote rules so that no party can dominate both houses of Congress. Also get to a government that works for the people not spreading lies and paying off billionaires	[]
Oh Yes.. everyone wants to be the President.. billionaire's club 😮	[]
In malemas south Africa??	[]
Mr. Trump is just popular in general in the Republican Party. On the other hand, Mr. Musk is just starting a political party. Moreover, Mr. Trump could face deportation, given that he is the son of immigrants and currently facing 34 criminal charges, which remain on hold due to his position as President of the United States.

Why doesnt Elon take his money and go fix his own country thats politically ripped to shreds? \nInstead of trying to change another country to suit him and his ideology.. DEPORT THE KIENT.. lets see how well SpaceX does operating outta Johannesburg 😂	[]
Well… Elon’s gonna be president now at some point. I’m calling it right now.	['second call', 'That is not possible. Under the current US law, only US-born US citizens are eligible for presidency. Elon Musk was born is South Africa.']
Hes gona lose Hes trying to help trump so no other party tries to oppose trump it is eastern politics making fool of general public.seen it before and does work	[]
Make an actual effort BBC.	[]
I learned what Elon's true character is, a hypocrite, traitor and backstabber that used Trump and his influence to do what he is doing right now & get more power. If you don't see that, you are closing your eyes to common sense.	[]
Elon Musk joined to Constitution Party👏	[]
😂😂😂😂😂😂go propaganda have some dtinky bone to chew	[]
Elon in big trouble.This will lead to de citizenship and deportation and the end of Tesla	[]
Ellon Should be Deported to Africa.	[]
Ellon is Crazy,No to Ellon,the Traitor,back stabber.Pres.Trump should not trust him.	[]
These billionaires think the world is their little monopoly game, God will deal with them👌	[]
Elon & Donald should team up. Two great men. Forge the way.	[]
This seems like a blues dream.. Divide the reds so they'll never win again..	[]
No way	[]
Elon musk is and was a Big Mistake	[]
No independent has ever won and never will elon is a conniving devil not a republican President Trump has made all the right choices except for choosing elon	[]
Something new to waste his time on.	[]
Wants to be president Elon	[]
President should have never let this traitor in that position or the white house	[]
Elon musk is no match against President Trump or the republican party Republicans are gor the citizens of the US	[]
Elon musk is no match against Vance or Desantis he is too stupid to runn the country and make good sensible choices	[]
Best just to keep the three perhaps.  Anything  that Elon puts his mind to gets done it seems.	[]
This arrogant idiot is going to get deported.	[]
Elon Musk is no match for President Trump or Vance Vance or Desantis will be the next president unless President Trump can run a third time	[]
Elon musk would not make it would make a terrible president needs to stick to business and quit these childish revengeful attacks against President Trump	[]
True America needs more than two parties.  At least 4 imo.	[]
Elon musk is acting stupid made over subsidies the government was giving him mad about the electric car mandate being reversed	[]
Con—men Trump and musk faking a fight over budget that affords musk billions for mars project,  the fight affords musk to create new party to attract—manipulate democrats  and independents not republicans— democrats win Congress in midterm Election it would be devastating to trump and musk $$$$ and power based goals. This con is obvious yet US media are missing the trump/ musk Con.	[]
President Trump made a mistake by letting elon musk in the white house he used to be and probably still is a democrat socialist l would not vote for him or his party	[]
All you have to do is change his skin color and all  hell breaks loose 😂	[]
Elon musk party will be a flop	[]
President Trump would have eon without elon musk or his money People voted for President Trump because we knew he would do what he said he would do no wars with Trump	[]
Elon musk is just wasting his money that party will not make it anywhere l think musk wants to be president he will never make it	[]
The AMERICA Party, so South America? It can’t be North America cuz Mexico and Canada, am I right?	[]
Nazi nerd  party.	[]
Jesus is coming soon!!!!	[]
Ego gone mad.	[]
Elon is a hypocrite, he should fail alongside Trump	[]
All good until Trump threatens to shut his welfare teet off !!!	[]
Few people not already a member of trump's cabinet are less qualified to ground a new party than musk.	[]
The dems and the republicans are the same. They are both bought and paid for by the exact same donors. Elon wants to change that. It's not a bad thing.	[]
Anything to stay relevant	[]
We already have "alternative" political parties.  There are 55 nationally recognized parties and almost 250 at state levels.  \nLibertarian, Green, Constitution, Natural Law, etc.....\nWe don't need more.  We just need real candidates and to put an end to corrupt campaign financing.  We're in a system where "other parties" and "independent" candidates can rarely be elected outside of a smaller, local election because only Democrats and Republicans have the money and the national recognition to actually compete at the scale necessarily to win a national election.  And, all due respect to all candidates of all parties (except Trump - who gets none from me) but when we get down to a race of 2 people to the top office in our country, we don't find the 2 best people for the job.  It's all about money and political favors for support, corporate and celebrity backing, and nasty slanderous, backstabbing campaigns run by super PACs.	[]
I back Elon musk 💯🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦	[]

Is he going to use the swastika?	[]
I would not vote!! For musk!!	[]
Trump and Musk have roughly 1 brain cell between the two of them and that's being kind. Why on earth would you back a man who's creating a party called "America First" but had done nothing but decimate America with his ego and his pathetic little DOGE.	[]
Who will be the head of the party? He certainly can't run given that he isn't an American-born citizen. The most likely outcome is that this new party will fall into obscurity, just like every other party outside of the Dem-Republican binary. Won't matter how much money he pours into it. It likely won't make a dent.	[]
New political party, 😂 take it out of America!!	[]
LoL.	[]
oh yeah because who wouldnt want to follow a man-child who faked online gameplay to impress gamers or something? takes part in an Election and party then when hes doesnt get his way he condems said party he was a part of and does a 180? yeh not the kind of clown anyone should follow	[]
Another lunatic 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡	[]
Brilliant! It'll be good for Elon to see in numbers just how unpopular he is 😆\n\n\nSome are saying this is good because it'll split the Republican vote but I reckon Elons party will be a non event 🤷	[]
He'll do anything to make sure his funding doesn't get stopped \n\nIf musk gets in\n\nA It's goodbye petrol diesel\n\n\nHe'll ram that EV down every ones throat	[]

What a f****** child	[]
God bless Elon for splitting the ultra right-wing vote! Gives me hope. 🇨🇦	[]
I really don't think people understand what Elon Musk wants to do. They just project themselves at him instead refusing to understand what actually, maybe he genuinely does give a damn.	[]
Sorry i like Elon Musk but all you have to do is look at Germany to find out real quick that this is a very stupid thing to do.\nThey have 41 aknowladged political parties of wich 5 met the neccessary 5% mark alowing them to have a seat in the government.\n\nAnd it sucks big time  because everyone of them has a diffrent agenda and very often oppose the good ideas just because the other  party came up with it.\n\nIf you want to change the system you have to become a part of the system because true change can only come from within and not by creating new political groups everytime you don't agree with soneting.

Let's wait to see what Elon can do for this country.\nI trust him.	[]
As an ilegal immigrant how is this even legal or possible ?	[]
What would Elon's agenda be? To remove Social Security, medicaid, medicare, all forms of help for the disabled and elderly? Would this be Eugenics 2.0 digital erasure of the disabled and elderly. Tax the homeless for taking up valuable oxygen and space. Tax all classes but the super wealthy. I have a better plan all laid out. \n\nTHE US CITIZENS CONSUMERS COOPERATIVE PARTY AND TRUST FUND AND ACT OF 2025\n\nTITLE I: PURPOSE AND DECLARATION\n\nLet this be known:\nTo every investor profiting off human necessity — your reign is over. To every politician who stalled for decades — the people will remember. And to every American who believed nothing could ever change — it just did.\n\nThe American people have waited long enough.\nWhile CEOs reward themselves billions, families ration insulin.\nWhile grocery giants report record profits, children skip meals.\nWhile energy conglomerates buy back their own stock, working Americans freeze in winter and bake in summer.\nWe are not poor. We have been robbed.\nAnd every citizen knows it. Every family scraping by, every veteran in a homeless shelter, every teacher working two jobs. We know who owns this economy, and we know they will not change unless we force it.\n\nThis Act is not a request. It is the people's demand, delivered with full constitutional and democratic authority.\n\nTITLE II: ESTABLISHMENT OF THE US CITIZENS COOPERATIVE PARTY AND TRUST FUND (USCCC)\n\nSECTION 201.  Congress shall authorize the immediate establishment of a sovereign, independent, public Trust Fund titled the US Citizens Consumers Cooperative Trust Fund (USCCC).\nSECTION 202. MISSION To reclaim the economy of basic human needs from for-profit ownership and convert it into a nonprofit, citizen-owned infrastructure that guarantees:\nLiving wages for workers\nStable, affordable prices for consumers\nProtection from speculation and monopolistic abuse\n\nSECTION 203. TARGET INDUSTRIES: The USCCC would be empowered to acquire, operate, and convert corporations and infrastructure to Non-Profit Entities related to:\nFood (farming, processing, retail)\nEnergy (fuel, electricity, solar, wind, oil & gas)\nHealthcare (providers, hospitals, pharmaceutical producers)\nHousing (builders, landlords, property developers)\nTransportation (logistics, rail, shipping)\nWater and utilities (broadband, clean water access)\n\nTITLE III: FUNDING AND CAPITALIZATION\n\nSECTION 301. FEDERAL SEED FUNDING \nInitial capitalization of $250 billion USD, to be appropriated immediately from:\nElimination of corporate subsidies for publicly traded companies\nA windfall tax on post-pandemic profits of Fortune 500 companies\nClosure of offshore loopholes and tax havens\nA 10% levy on CEO compensation over $20 million annually\nTransfer of unredeemed COVID stimulus funds held in reserve\nSECTION 302. PUBLIC DONATIONS AND BONDS\nUS citizens may donate tax-deductible contributions to the Trust\nOption to purchase Citizen Sovereignty Bonds with a guaranteed inflation hedge return\nMatching grants from state and municipal governments\nThe IRS Collects 4 Trillion from Working US Citizens annually. Possible voluntary one third income tax to be held and allocated toward Trust Fund \n\nTITLE IV: POWERS AND OPERATIONS\nSECTION 401. NEGOTIATED BUYOUTS \nThe Fund shall engage in direct negotiation for share buyouts of target corporations, with emphasis on divisions and subsidiaries directly related to public needs.\n\nSECTION 402. NONPROFIT TRANSFORMATION \nAll acquired entities shall:\nBe transitioned into nonprofit cooperative enterprises\nCap executive compensation at 10x the lowest-paid full-time employee\nOffer democratic representation to workers and consumers\n\nSECTION 403. NATIONALIZATION PROTOCOL \nIn cases of refusal, obstruction, or bad faith, the USCCC shall be empowered to recommend and execute nationalization under existing eminent domain statutes for essential services.\n\nTITLE V: TRANSPARENCY, GOVERNANCE, AND PROTECTION\nSECTION 501. PEOPLE'S OVERSIGHT BOARD\n15-person board elected by popular vote every 4 years\nNo corporate donors, PACs, or lobbyists may participate in elections\n\nSECTION 502. PUBLIC LEDGER\nAll buyouts, financial reports, and wage ratios will be published quarterly\n\nSECTION 503. LEGAL PROTECTIONS\nAssets held by the USCCC may not be sold, transferred, or privatized without a national referendum\n\nTITLE VI: TIMELINE AND ENFORCEMENT\nThis Act shall go into effect within 30 days of passage\nFirst wave of acquisition targets to be announced within 90 days\nUSCCC Trust must begin operations within 180 days\n\nThis is the end of profit from pain. This is the dawn of public, not private or government power.\n\nSUMMARY: This Trust Fund would only be used to use the Free Market and Capitalist system against those who put high profits over the welfare of the working class and consumer. \nThe Bill or Measure would not seek to change the habits of Oligarchs, it would seek to create a separate economy based on Psychologists Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, including Security, Safety and Self-Actualization. Humans can't self-actualize as long as they are struggling to meet their everyday needs. \n\nIf everyone was prospering, we could see crime go down dramatically. \n\nExample Corporations to buy and convert to Non-Profit. Using the net profits to raise wages 'above' the norm. Lower cost of living 'below' the norm. \n\nFood. \nKroger's $46 Billion"\nAlbertsons, $24 Billion\nSafeway  $9 Billion\n\nEnergy. \nPG&E $30 Billion. \n\nOil/Gas \nChevron $256 Billion.\n\nWE would buy or build the following. \nLand, farms, food processing plants, distribution networks, production, manufacturing, of products, including those needed to build homes and other structures, that meet our needs. Including Transportation, Technology, \n\nThis is not Socialism because it would use the same free and fair market, capitalist system Oligarchs use to become wealthy. Instead of wealth going to shareholders, stock brokers and traders who contribute nothing but get a dividend check every third quarter, All Corporations under the Trust Fund would be pulled from the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Let what happens on Wall Street stay on Wall Street. It will no longer affect the flow of food, goods and services or raise the cost.	[]
As if the Republican party isn't good enough to billionaires.	[]
Sorry not gonna work	[]
Lol...let him burn more money. Musk has absolutely zero charisma...he's never run or win an election and the last person he backed lost.\nWhat Musk will find out is that Trump represents a movement much larger than a political party.	[]
Musk👍👍👍👍👍🙏	[]
Is it time to dump Tesla shares... neither Dems or Reps will support him, there will be so much push back...I thought him quiting doge means more focus on Tesla....but it seems like he has double down😅😅	[]
Get lost musk, the world thinks youre a freak.	[]
Isn’t it called The Independent Party?	[]
Correct me if I’m wrong ! I think one must be born in the USA to be able to run for office 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿	['He can start a political party and have someone else lead it.']
GOOD FOR HIM!!	[]
We should now Split the Democrat vote and Finally establish the Social Democrats.	[]
I love Elon.\n\nHe's an idiot. 😂	[]
So out of touch.  Musk is a loony	[]
😮	[]
I am not a fan BUT.. good for him, if you don't like what you see, do something about it, he has the $$$ and hopefully would do right by the people, tend to the sick, help the poor etc....	[]
American party 😂	[]
Attention seeking like a mf	[]
Is this India’s presenters	[]
The irony of asking people on X who are also Elon followers is you get a very bias/unscientific pool of people from around the world.	[]
What a brilliant businessman! ..Yes sirree!	[]
I think the POPE shoukd be the next President! Love, compassion, empathy for all Amerucans and immigrants.	[]
In true South African style, he formed a new political party 😂	[]
I don’t trust Elon Musk. Billionaires shouldn’t have that much control. People from working class or middle class backgrounds should lead in politics. They understand the struggles everyday folks face. Capitalism is the playground of the rich, but the government should belong to the people, not serve their games	[]
hes so annoying power hungry idiuot	[]
Isn't he south african? What's it to do with him?	[]
😂😂😂  he was the one who first started the problems.  Now he wants to atart his own party...what a planet	[]
Should take some votes from Republicans, so more likely election of Democrats. Musk is increasingly egotistical --  little ability for judgement remains.	[]
Wish he'd launch himself into the sun.	[]
I bet his drug dealer is rubbing their hands together......	[]
Stick with tech and other ventures Elon. No politics PLEASE!	[]
Hes just now realizing that the conservative right hates clean energy lmaoo.	[]
He is sooo wrong!! When a child doesn’t get his way then throughs a tantrum.  Hope and pray he realizes what he is doing before is too late.	[]
Wow. The world is being ran by kids in men's bodies 😂😂😂😂😂	[]
The same person who said few months ago: "This will be the last election in America if you don't vote for trump"\nThe clown show has no limit, enjoy the comedy.	['What is really hilarious is that some Dems think that Repubs will join his new party and will split the vote of the RNC.  Too funny!', '@DesertGuy69 I know right, republicans are too loyal to The Felon, there’s no way they’d find a new god to worship.', 'US political culture is the same as the political culture of countries on the African continent', 'circus', 'I think Elon said according to what information he had been handled at the time.']
Remember the Elon salute and his love for Putin. Looks like he's trying to do the Kremlin's job.	['Yes, he is a man not to be trusted and they keep forgetting.', "Who are you? Your not American so stop making it worse. It's not funny \\u200bpaulynejoh"]
Still funny to me how people still believe that it actually matters which political party is in power in the usa or uk. Just a smoke screen	["It is *extremely* important which political party is power. Everywhere. Not just in the US or the UK.\\n\\nTake the post-WWI Germany, for instance. If Hitler's party did not get to power, there would not be WWII as we know it. Take Russia, for example. If Putin's party was not in power, there would not be a full-scale war in Ukraine. If you consider today's Britain, the Nigel Farage's party seems to be on its way to dismantle democracy in the UK. And the today's Republican party in the US consists mostly of non-critical supporters of everything and anything that Trump does. It is very similar to a Trump cult. In Hungary, for instance, the party of Viktor Orbán is another example of an authoritarian party which would like to dismantle the democracy not only in Hungary but in the entire EU.\\n\\nSo, to reiterate, it is *extremely* important which political party is in power. Most of them are really trying to help their citizens. But some of them are just vehicles to get power and their leaders would not hesitate to do anything to remain in power. It is very important to distinguish between these kind of political parties and politicians."]
It be easier if he tried to primary Republicans then form a new party. But Elon is an idiot	[]
Ketamin for president!	[]
Rather vote for amy whitehouse 😊	[]
God bless Elon , he is a hero!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉	[]
Musk is one of the few publics figures I trust. If you don't trust him, name some one you do trust and maybe I get another source for truth.	[]
"A party to rival the Republicans"? Dividi et Impera. Nothing new since the Roman Empire.	['thank you for this cm. today i learnt a new phrase thanks to you.', 'Unus et Collabora.

I wonder how much he paid the creative agency to come up with the name?	[]

this is comedy gold lol	[]
Well, that's just what america needs. Another right wing party.  They've already got two parties owned by isreal. Will musk be different and not be owned by a foreign power, or will he sign up to the racist project too?	["Musk doesn't support Israeli wars. Obviously."]
Musk knows that his only chance at even a little bit of societal redemption is to cost Republicans as many elections as possible over the next 4 years.	[]
People mad about this but not mad about the "Big Beautiful Bill" that got passed speaks volumes lmao Elon created DODGE just to have it be basically undone by Trump and his bill 🤣🤣🤣	[]

Yeh right	[]

Not another white party and leader?! 😂	[]
Will his party take off? Judging by his rockets' performance very doubtful.	[]
Can this be really be perceived as serious and credible? His allegiance with Trump and how He conducted himself once Trump regained power has left him stained and difficult to trust. For what He's attempting to build, it hasn't exactly got sound foundations.	[]
He create his impire out of nothing	["No tf he didn't. Wtf are you talking about? 😂"]

GET HIM OUT OF OUR POLITICS!  GO BACK TO S. AFRICA.🤬🤬🤬	[]
Totally unbiased journalism "put's a few months old thumbnail where the subject has a black eye" 😂😂 The BBC is not what it used to be sadly	[]
My money is on that his gonna discontinue the party after a few months or years after realizing it's too expensive, his not getting any donors, government is not giving him any contracts to fund his movement and will probably start backing non-republican candidates (not democrats)	[]
Doing it the South African way lol everyone wants to be boss	[]
How much is he buying votes for this time? Go to Mars already. And stay there.	[]
We obviously need to hear a lot less from d-bag billionaires, not more.	[]

Add the oddball Nerd Reich ramblings of far right weirdo Curtis Yarvin, guru to the billionaire tech bros, and Musk's party is a recipe for disaster.	[]

Elon will use this to cut 3-4% votes from the Republicans and blackmail them.	[]
Muskolini's new party will have the roman salute as its greeting and swastikas as their mode of transport. They will have a funny sort of x as their flag.	[]
Certainly, will be interesting if Elon spills the beans on what really was going on in the Republican Party and Whitehouse?	[]
america needs an actual left leaning party. the dems are centre right on most things.	[]
A political party for Mars 😂	[]
Time to tell everyone about Trump and Epstein	[]
Poor Elon. He made billions from government contracts and subsidies and when the EV credit got yanked, he got a hissy fit. Keep to making cars and rockets and stay out of politics.	[]
Why doesn’t he form a South Africa Party?	[]
A privately owned political party! What a “good” idea!	[]

The problem with another party I think, is that will they take votes from the republicans or the democrats? The idea is obviously to take votes from the republicans, but the risk is that it also will weaken the democrats to the point that the republicans doesn't need as many votes to win as they normally would.

Let him try! How many politicians today truly stand with the common people? In so-called 'democracies' like the UK and Germany, ruling parties often seize power with razor-thin majorities, or even minority support.

The world desperately needs an alternative to America’s outdated Cold War mentality; this tired game of 'Us vs. Them' only fuels division. If someone can finally break from this failed 20th-century doctrine, shouldn’t we give them a chance?	['And you think Elon Musk has anything in common with common people ?

Because billionaires are so underrepresented? Give me a break. But fine, if you want to split the GOP vote, go for it.	['Without money you just work for the banks... but we get your point.', 'Not sure yet if that will be the result. MAGA is quickly turning on Elon. Like that CatTurd guy... just a month ago or so he was praising Elon and saying "Take me to Mars", and yesterday he made a tweet like "Trying to go to Mars is a waste of money" (I\\'m paraphrasing ofc). Also, now suddenly, Grok is woke too. Elon may find very soon that, he\\'s dealing with most of us already know, he\\'s dealing with a cult.']
The enemy of my enemy is STILL my enemy.	[]
Jeff Bezos should start one too!	[]
No thanks Elon.	[]
So first step of the Blade Runner future? Mega corp owns all?	[]
Who cares. After Trumps presidency  is over the world will be in a state of catastrophe. Not because  of Trump but because  the one worlders want it that way to create an environment  for the dragon.	[]
Elon Musk isn't an American-born citizen. He can't be President.	[]
I was pumped when I heard this. I support anything that will split the republican vote.	['Same here.. this destroys the GOP and the two party death grip. It hurts the republicans the most and takes power away from them. This is the answer.', 'Amen to that.', 'Maybe the democrats who aren’t crazy will join it too', 'im more when is he going to prison.', '\\u200b@Lundershot1 no the Democrats will focus on their party and just win because the other vote is split']
Yeah go for it  \ntake Greta and salensky with you	[]
Can we deport him already? Let him play politics in his homeland.	[]
He's not the full ticket.	[]
The BBC can now  promote his political propaganda. By doing this  the BBC can fulfill it's  financial commitments. Fake biased media outlet	[]
If the rest of the world is not watching America saying what a SHYTshow this is‼️ Not being entertained by it. THEN YOU ARE LIVING LIFE WRONG 😂	["As a outsider i'm more worried about the average American opposition to more choice."]
Trump is an old guy. Musk is 54. He will be here in 2050s so wanting more is nothing wrong for him. At least he thinks like this.	[]
68M views (worldwide), 1.2M X users voted (worldwide). Meaning 812,765 users want a new party. How many of those are legitimate American votes?	['Better yet: how many are actual people, rather than bots?']

It’ll still remain a 2 party system	[]

😂😂 Imagine a political party run by a guy who micromanage, a social weirdo/reclusive, a Ketamine user etc... Trump is an absolute idiot and a crook but any party run by Musk will be a disaster.

Tech/internet/crypto party?	['The "fill up Elon\\'s pocket" party']
He is good in business but a moron in understanding people 😂😂.	[]
Elon Musk announcing a new political party is more than just headline material, it’s a seismic moment in American politics. Coming from a figure who’s reshaped industries, this move could disrupt traditional party lines and pull in a wave of independent and tech-driven voters. The real question now is: will this party bring genuine solutions or just more polarization?	['Real solutions? Really? That’s even a question?']
South Park and the Onion are becoming too real	["idk I always found their satire on right wing politics surreal and exaggerated, but now it's reaility."]

The Israeli decided who will be the President, not the American people.	[]

Nah, Elon can go screw himself.	[]
Can we get someone else?	[]
So a third party run by a rich authoritarian(s).  Wow, what a novel idea.  /s\nWe need term limits, campaign finance reform and ranked choice voting but sure  let's do this bs instead.  I wonder if they'll have a special salute?	[]
Out of proportion	[]
If this actually goes ahead, it will split the right-wing vote and give the Democrats a historic majority in the House of Representatives.	[]

Trump can or could order "Seal team 6" on political opponents and be immune from prosecution sealed by the US supreme court so Musk should be careful 😅, America what a country 😅	[]
If the chinese EV companies had fair access to EU and US markets, Tesla would not even exist anymore. He should actually thank the governments for keeping his company alive by suppressing the competition.	[]
